We’d get chatting, I \nthought, and I could maybe ask them to spot me, but the day slowly passed, \nand I was still alone. Occasionally I heard a noise from the changing rooms that \nI would have sworn was someone coming in, but there was no-one. Eventually, \nI showered, changed back, and headed home for a less-than-exciting dinner of \nchicken and beans. \nThe next day was the same, and the one after that. No matter when I went, the \nplace was always empty, with no sign of J or anybody else. I wondered if \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG090 – Body Builder \n10 \n \nsomehow I’d been tricked into paying to use an abandoned gym or something, \nbut it was well maintained and really clean, so someone was looking after it. In \nfact, thinking about it, I’d say it might have been the cleanest gym I’d ever \nused, although at the time I thought that was because I was the only one using \nit. \nAbout five days into my time there, I finally met someone else. Her name was \nMarie Balandin, and she seemed just as surprised to see me as I was to see her. \nApparently she had been using the gym for about two months and had, like \nme, thought she was the only one. She’d been off to see her sister down in \nGlasgow for a week, and was a bit shocked I’d turned up in her absence. We \ngot to talking, though, and got on pretty well, so sure enough after a few \nminutes she offered to spot me. \nTruth be told, I was a bit dubious she’d be able to keep up, but a few sets shut \nme right up. Whatever she was taking, she was a lot further along than me, \nand by the end I was struggling when spotting her. Still, there was a \ncamaraderie that came from being the only two people in that weird place, \nand it didn’t take long for us to become good friends, swapping diet tips and \ntheories about what the deal was with J, whose real name, she claimed, was \nJared. \nThere was one other advantage to knowing Marie was around – it helped me \nignore the sounds from the locker room. The occasional thumps and creaks. I \ncould just write it off as her being a bit clumsy. Even when I hadn’t seen her \ncome in. \nMarie was apparently quite a big deal in some of the international women’s \nbodybuilding competitions. I’d never followed them, but she showed me a few \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG090 – Body Builder \n11 \n \nof her trophies once. The way she trained, though, it was intense, driven. More \ndriven than I’d expect from someone with so many wins under her belt. She’d \npush herself way past the point of exhaustion every day, and for all the awards \nher body had gotten her, it sometimes seemed to me like she wanted to \ndestroy it. Often I’d find her staring at the mirror in the changing room, her \ngaze locked on her shoulders, moving them slowly up and down with a look of \ndisgust on her face. \nI didn’t really think about it too much, though, as my own steroid course was \nstarting to show results, and I was spending plenty of time in front of the \nmirror myself. It wasn’t enough, though. I knew it wasn’t enough. I knew I was \ngoing to have to go on another course as soon as my body had recovered from \nthis one. Maybe even sooner. \nI don’t know how it would have ended if I hadn’t lost my phone. I don’t have \nmuch of a social life, so I didn’t notice it was gone until I was getting ready for \nbed. It must have fallen out of my jacket pocket when I’d hung it up at the \ngym. I wouldn’t have minded waiting until the next day, but it had my training \ndiary on it, and I always spent ten minutes filling it in before bed. It was a small \nritual, but an important one, and given it was just down the road, I figured I \nmight as well go and see if the gym was still open. Since no-one ever seemed \nto be around, I figured, maybe no-one locked it overnight. \nSo at about half past eleven last Wednesday night, I found myself gently \npushing open the door to my gym. It wasn’t locked, just as I guessed, and \neverything inside seemed quiet. I headed through into the changing room, and \nthere was my phone, where it had fallen in my locker. I grabbed it, and was just \nabout to leave, when I heard movement coming from the gym itself, and \nnearly jumped out of my skin.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 3, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 4347}}
