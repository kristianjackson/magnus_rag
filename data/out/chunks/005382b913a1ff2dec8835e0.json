It was an instruction. We can’t move on until you do. \nMARTIN \nJohn, what are you getting at? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 178 – The Processing Line \n17 \nARCHIVIST \nThis isn't just a journey through spaces. \n(Beat) \nBASIRA \nFine. I recognise her. \nI don't know her name though. \nARCHIVIST \nIsabelle Moran. Shoplifter, drug addict. Daisy was certain she was dealing as \nwell. Derailed her recovery twice. \nBASIRA \nFine. Noted. \nCan we just move on please? \nARCHIVIST \nI’m afraid not. \nBASIRA \nWhy not? \nARCHIVIST \nWe aren’t finished here. \nBASIRA \nIs that a threat? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 178 – The Processing Line \n18 \nMARTIN \nGuys come on, don’t do this, not here. \nARCHIVIST \nI told you before — we can’t hunt a monster you refuse to see. \nBASIRA \nDon’t give me that patronising, ominous-oracle bullshit John. I’m not an idiot. \nARCHIVIST \nI never said you were. \nMARTIN \nGuys... \nBASIRA \n(Angry) Look, I need you to lead the way. I don't need your advice, and \ncertainly don't need you stood there judging me! \nMARTIN \n(Loudly) Enough. Enough! Someone has died! Show some respect. Or don’t \nyou care? \nBASIRA \n(Incensed) Of course I fucking care! \n(Beat) \n(Quieter) That’s the problem. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 178 – The Processing Line \n19 \nMARTIN \nI... I don’t understand. \nBASIRA \nI just… I don’t need him laying everything out for me like I’m some kind of \nidiot. I know all right. Daisy is the only person I could ever rely on and… and \nshe… she did things, terrible things and I… I refused to see it or… said it was my \nduty or whatever, I don’t know. \nMARTIN \nBasira... \nBASIRA \nI care, I just… I don’t need to wallow in it. I need to end it. All of it. \nMARTIN \n…We’re here for you. \nBASIRA \nNo. She was there for me. \nARCHIVIST \nCops vs robbers and monsters... \nBASIRA \nI thought we were doing good. I really did. I knew there was some bad shit. I \nknew Daisy was into a lot of it, but... I thought it balanced out. \n(Weakly) I thought we were good. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 178 – The Processing Line \n20 \nARCHIVIST \n(Softly) I know how that feels. \n(Beat) \nBASIRA \nI wanted to help people, you know? When I first joined. Protect people. But \nthen I saw what some of those same people were capable of, and... something \nchanged. I wanted to hurt them, the ones that deserved it, and it… it felt good. \nIt felt righteous. \nI thought I could feel the line though. I really did. Eventually, though, it was too \nmuch... I was going to quit. I couldn't take what I saw myself becoming. But… \nthen I got sectioned, and suddenly… suddenly it turned out there were real \nmonsters out there, and, well, that just made the power feel better. So things \nkept slipping. But, Daisy was always there for me. \nMARTIN \nAll those innocent people... \nBASIRA \nWere they? Innocent? \nARCHIVIST \nSome. And if not (inhale) what crime warrants what was done to them? Theft? \nViolence? Disrespect? \nBASIRA \nYou knew her. She was trying to be better. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 178 – The Processing Line \n21 \nARCHIVIST \nShe was. \nBut she never asked me to forgive her. \nBASIRA \nForgive her? \nARCHIVIST \nI’ve been scared, terrified for my life so many times these last few years — but \nI’ve never, not once, felt so horribly, abjectly, powerless as when she took me \ninto that forest to kill me. I’ll never forget it. \nMARTIN \nYou never said… \nARCHIVIST \n(Shaky) It’s not easy to talk about. \nMARTIN \nOh John... \nBASIRA \nAnd would you have? Forgiven her? \nARCHIVIST \nNo. But she never asked me. She knew she had no right. \n(Beat) \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 178 – The Processing Line \n22 \nBASIRA \nI really am going to have to kill her, aren’t I? \nARCHIVIST \nThere’s no way to bring her back. Not anymore. At this point, if I tried to take \naway her fear i... it would destroy her anyway. \nBASIRA \nAm I even going to be able to? \nARCHIVIST \nYes. \nBASIRA \nAnd she stays dead? \nARCHIVIST \nIn this case, yes. \nMARTIN \nWhat about the powers? \nARCHIVIST \nDream logic remember? She won’t come back. Trust me. \nBASIRA \n…Does she want me to kill her?", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 5, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 4173}}
