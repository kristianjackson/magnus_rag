But there was nothing, and I followed him inside. \nJustin Gough was sat in the main bedroom. His back pressed against the wall \nopposite a bed, where a middle-aged man lay sleeping. The room was quiet, \nand at first I thought there was no movement at all, but as I watched, I saw the \nface of the man in the bed contort and spasm, as though racked with awful \nnightmares, his chest heaving and convulsing as he struggled to breathe. I \nlooked to the man I assumed to be his assailant, but to all appearances, it \nseemed like Justin Gough was also asleep, sat in the corner of that nondescript \nsuburban bedroom. But then I saw his eyelids flicker, and I realised what was \ngoing on. \n\nWhat is the line between a near-death experience and a dream? Perhaps you \ndo leave yourself, brush against the afterlife and return, but… I don’t believe it. \nI believe they are both simply the firings of a brain we no longer have control \nover, and perhaps if you make contact with something terrible in one, it \ncontinues to live with you in the other. And perhaps it demands you infect \nothers with your fate. \nI was not quick enough to save the man who lived in that house. Truth be told, \nI didn’t especially try. I didn’t think I would be able to move quick enough to do \nso, and was more concerned with being quiet and thorough. The cutlery \ndrawer was largely empty, but after a minute’s searching I did find what I was \nafter: a long, metal skewer. \nDid you know there are certain forms of brain injury that cut you off from your \nability to dream? \nIronically enough, it’s sometimes caused by carbon monoxide poisoning, but \nthere is still no definitive answer about which part of the brain needs to be \ninjured for it to happen. So I made the decision it was better to be on the safe \nside, as I pushed the point up past his eye, sliding it into that little gap between \neyeball and tear duct, and up into his brain. \nI knew it wouldn’t kill him, he’s too far from human for me to do so, but I \nthought that scrambling his brain a bit was probably my best bet. And I was \nright, as far as it goes. He survived what I did to him, and when the police \npicked him up after an ‘anonymous tip’ about a break-in, he was barely able to \nspeak, and I very much hope I managed to sever his dreams. \nI have no interest in pursuing this further, but given the mind’s remarkable \naptitude for healing, not to mention the resilience of creatures like him, I \n\ncannot make any guarantees Justin Gough will remain in the state I left him. \nAnd it seems that, as he deals in dreams, it may be worth your while to keep \nan eye on the statements you take, in case he finds his way here. I’m sure you \ncan take care of yourself, of course, but I thought it would be worth letting you \nknow. Good luck, Gertrude. And enjoy the fireworks. \nARCHIVIST \nStatement ends. \nThis was found tucked into a hard case containing… many blocks of plastic \nexplosive, kept by Gertrude Robinson in a storage unit that I can only assume \nhas… extremely lax oversight. It is unclear if she ever read it. \nYou know, after my conversation with Gerard, I, I actually thought I was \nstarting to get a handle on everything, how it works, the connections between \nit all. It is… strangely reassuring to have a statement where, once again, I find \nmyself having… remarkably little idea what it’s talking about. \nJustin Gough was clearly an avatar of The End, but… I have no idea what else \nDekker was alluding to. \nSo Gertrude knew Adelard Dekker as well? I wonder is there anyone connected \nto the supernatural that she was not on first name terms with? I suppose if you \nspend fifty years as the focal point of horrors, eventually everyone ends up \nknowing you. Or dead. Or… both. \nI know there are more important things to be doing, but I did ask Basira to \nhave a quick search for Justin Gough, see what might have happened to him. \nThere are records of his residence in an East London care facility until 2015, \nwhen he disappears from their records.
