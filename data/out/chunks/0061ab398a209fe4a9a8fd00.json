She told me to sit down, and I did. I heard the levers and \npulleys move behind me, and I could tell that Neil was being walked down the \ncorridor towards this woman, but I couldn’t see. I couldn’t turn my head, so I \ndon’t really know what his reaction was, but it didn’t sound like one of fear or \ndespair. \nHe called her Annabelle, and she sent me to his screening room. She told me I \nwas to watch his original cuts. “Just until we’re all done here,” she said. And as \nI walked away from Neil, the last time I saw him alive, he was dancing, the \ncables shifting and moving him in a graceful, sweeping ballet. And he was \ncrying with joy. \nI don’t know how long I was watching those films. They don’t ... It was hard to \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 136 – The Puppeteer \n12 \n \nkeep track of time. According to my daughter, I was missing for five months. \nWhen Annabelle let me out, Neil was dead. He was hanging there, wrapped in \nhis strings like a cocoon, twisting gently around and around and around. She \ntold me to take the films, his original cuts. She told me to come here. She told \nme to give them to you. I resisted for some time, but I’m done now. She’s won. \nAnd I would very much like to go home. \nARCHIVIST \nStatement ends. \nHm, Neil Lagorio ... You ever see any of his work? \nDAISY \nNo. Not really into films. \nARCHIVIST \nThey were ... Well, let’s just say it’s not a complete shock there was something \nunnatural to them. Didn’t know we had copies in the Institute, though, let \nalone original cuts. Records indicate they ended up in Artefact Storage. \nDAISY \nProbably best they stay there. \nARCHIVIST \nYeah ... Yes, of course. Annabelle Cane, though ... She worries me. I don’t \nknow. This is the second time she’s turned up, uh, peripheral to the Institute. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 136 – The Puppeteer \n13 \n \nDAISY \nThat you know of. \nARCHIVIST \nMeaning what? \nDAISY \nShe’s Web. Spider’s sneaky like that. Like that lighter you’re always using – \nwhere’d you get that? \nARCHIVIST \nHm, good point. We should keep our eyes open. Anyway, how’s Basira doing? I \nhaven’t seen her much since ... Well, she seemed a bit tense the last few times \nwe spoke. How are you guys doing? \nDAISY \nNo, Basira, she’s ... She’s been good. We’re together, so it’s good. Wish she \ndidn’t keep treating me like a china doll. But it’s alright. \nARCHIVIST \nIt’s understandable, I suppose. \nDAISY \nYeah, well, what do you think? You think I’m weak just cos I’m not already \nchasing the next kill? You think I’m less me? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 136 – The Puppeteer \n14 \n \nARCHIVIST \nI ... I don’t feel like I’m exactly in the best place to judge the intersection \nbetween free will and humanity. Still trying to figure that out myself. \nDAISY \nJohn ... When you went in the coffin, was it you choosing to do that? Did you \nactually think you could save me or was something telling you to do it? \nARCHIVIST \nIt was me. I was drawn to it, I’ll admit, but it was my decision. It wasn’t entirely \nabout you, though. \nDAISY \nWhat was it? \nARCHIVIST \nMy— My memories of the coma are not clear, but I know I made a choice. I \nmade a choice to become … something else. Because I was afraid to die. But \never since then, I don’t know if I made the right decision. I’m stronger now, \ntougher, I can ... If I do die, now, or get sealed away somewhere forever, I \ndon’t know if that’s a bad thing. And I don’t want to lose anyone else, so if I \ncan maybe stop that happening and the only danger is to me … I’ll do it in a \nheartbeat. Worst case scenario, the universe loses another monster. \nDAISY \nThat’s messed up. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 136 – The Puppeteer \n15 \n \nARCHIVIST \n(Laughs) Yeah. I suppose it is. \nDAISY \nDid you know the coffin wouldn’t kill you? \nARCHIVIST \nI guess I thought imprisonment wouldn’t ... wouldn’t be as bad as it was. And \nit’s a lot easier to make that choice than it is to actually endure the result. You \nmight have noticed, when I was in there with you, I had regrets. \nDAISY \nYeah, I remember. \nARCHIVIST \nPlus, I thought ... Well, I didn’t know what being down there had done to you. \nDAISY \nYou thought I was going to kill you? \nARCHIVIST \nIt was a possibility. \nDAISY \nGuess so.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 5, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 4240}}
