We climb the tower, take out the bad guy, figure out \nhow to change the world back, and back in time for tea. \nRight? \nARCHIVIST \nWe’ve certainly got the audience for it. \nMARTIN \nYeah. They did roll out the red carpet, didn’t they? Must be nice getting the \nstar treatment. \nARCHIVIST \nI’d hardly call flooding Oxford Street with blood, the “star treatment”. \nMARTIN \nOh no? What would you call it? \nARCHIVIST \nA very lazy metaphor. \nMARTIN \nWow, you’re really determined not to engage aren’t you? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 189 – Peers \n \n3 \nARCHIVIST \nI’m just nervous. Jonah Magnus is waiting at the top of this tower, and he \nobviously knows we’re coming. \nMARTIN \nI mean, yeah, okay, but— \nARCHIVIST \nAnd not only that, every eye in an entire city made of nothing but eyes is \nstaring at me while I try to prepare. \n(An amused snort from Martin) \nWhat? \nMARTIN \n(Amused) Seriously? Stage fright? The great Archivist, master of all he surveys \ncan’t handle a bit of public attention? \nARCHIVIST \nWell, clearly not. \nI’m more comfortable actually doing the looking. \nMARTIN \n(Sarcastic) Oh, I’m so sorry John, I didn’t realise. God forbid you get \nuncomfortable. I guess I’ll just tell everyone it’s off then, shall I? We’ll just go. \nARCHIVIST \nYou don’t need to be sarcastic, okay? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 189 – Peers \n \n4 \nMARTIN \nYou’re right, I’m sorry. If it’s any consolation, I’m scared too. \nARCHIVIST \nThat’s what concerns me. \nMARTIN \nI don’t follow? \nARCHIVIST \nWhat if our fear is feeding him? Making him stronger? \nMARTIN \nBut you’re with The Eye too, though, right? So, maybe it’s making you stronger \nas well. \n…John? \nARCHIVIST \n(Softly) No, you’re… you’re right. Of- of course you’re right. I can’t believe I \ndidn’t consider it before... \nMARTIN \nJohn? Use your words. \nARCHIVIST \nMe- me vs Elias— Jonah. We… We both draw power from The Eye. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 189 – Peers \n \n5 \nMARTIN \nWell yeah, obviously. \nARCHIVIST \nNo but— That— There’s— I mean, if we face off, try to destroy each other, it’s \nnot like it’s going to be an actual fight— \nMARTIN \nHey! Don’t talk like that, okay, we can take him! \nARCHIVIST \nNo, Martin, listen, what I’m saying is that whichever way you cut it, ultimately \nit just comes down to who The Eye chooses. \nMARTIN \nSo what, it’s just a, an eldritch popularity contest? \nARCHIVIST \nYes. Except one of the contestants is also planning to try and murder the judge. \nMARTIN \n…Um. \n(Searchingly) Maybe it hasn’t realised? \nARCHIVIST \nMartin I… I don’t see any way I can win this. Not now, not like this. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 189 – Peers \n \n6 \nMARTIN \n(Spluttering) Well, hang on, hang on, okay, let’s think about this a moment. \nYou’re- you’re making a load of assumptions here. You can’t see inside, \nremember? We have no idea what’s happening up there. \nARCHIVIST \nYou’re right, meaning we have no idea what he’s got planned for us. \nMARTIN \n(Frustrated) Yeah, but that was always going to be the case, wasn’t it? \n[Footsteps as the Archivist backs away] \nMARTIN (CONT’D) \nWait, where are you going? \nARCHIVIST \nWe shouldn’t have come. \n[Martin pulls the Archivist back] \nMARTIN \nA-oh, yeah, sure! We should just go with one of all those other options that we \nhave hidden up our sleeves, yeah? \nARCHIVIST \nMartin…", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 0, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 4101}}
