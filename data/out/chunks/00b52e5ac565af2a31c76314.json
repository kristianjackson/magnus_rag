I chased it \nsleepily out of my bedroom and down the hall, past the stairs and towards ... a \ndoorway I didn’t recognise. I was sure that when I’d gone to bed it had been a \npatch of wall with a painting of an old sailboat on it, but now it was an open \ndoorway. A small amount of light leaked from around the edges of the door to \nmy parents’ room, behind me, but it didn’t reach very far at all, and beyond \nthe threshold it was completely dark. That was when I started to feel scared. \nI could see the wooden handle of my skipping rope lying in the corridor, with \nits heavy green cord stretching out and into the door, until it disappeared in \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 146 – Threshold \n \n4 \n \nthe darkness. I realised I was shaking. I didn’t want to go through that door. So, \nI picked up the handle and started to gently pull on the rope, trying to drag it \nback out again. Instead of moving, the line went taught. Something was \nholding the other end, and it was trying to pull me. For one awful moment, I \nfound myself frozen in a tug-of-war with whatever was stood inside that door, \nclinging desperately to that rope as it stretched away and vanished into \nblackness. But I was six, and I felt myself starting to lose my footing and fall \ntowards it, so I did the only thing I could. I let go and I watched my most \ntreasured possession disappear forever as the door closed behind it, and I ran \nback to bed. \nI told my parents, of course, but they didn’t believe me. They just thought I’d \nlost it and was making up wild stories to cover it up. The wall was the wall \nagain, and the picture of the old sailing boat was back where it should have \nbeen. \nThe next time, I was eleven, and that time the door wasn’t really there. Well, it \nwas, but it was covered in concrete. It was in this old alley about five minutes’ \nwalk from my house, and one of the buildings was this abandoned warehouse. \nAt least, I think it was a warehouse. The wooden signs were rotted away and \nthe windows had all been broken, and the main door had been covered in a \nlayer of perfectly smooth, grey concrete. I passed it on the way home from \nschool almost every day, and something about that blank grey space, where a \ndoor should have been, always gave me a slight shiver of unease. \nThen one day, I was walking past, and the door that stole my skipping rope was \nthere. The thing was, though, I couldn’t see it, because it was still covered in \nthat concrete. But I knew it was there. Before, there’d been nothing behind it, \nbut now, I was certain. Now, in the centre of the concrete, were five clear \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 146 – Threshold \n \n5 \n \nmarks, as though someone had pressed their fingers into the mixture when it \nhad still been wet. \nI stood there, staring at it like I had all those years ago. It was playing with me \nagain, but this time, it wasn’t looking to play with a skipping rope. This time, it \nwas a dare. It was daring me to put my own hand on that rough concrete, to fit \nmy fingers into the hollow spaces it had made for me, and open it. It was a \nwindy afternoon, but for that moment, the narrow street where I stood was \ncompletely still. I could feel the muscles in my arm tensing, preparing to \nstretch towards it, to accept the dare from a door that had hidden itself so \nsneakily under all that concrete. Then my friend Luke yelled at me from the \nend of the street. The fear was gone in a second, and I ran to catch up with \nhim. \nI did, however, make the mistake of telling my parents about it, and reminding \nthem of the other time it had happened, when I was six. This time, they didn’t \ndismiss it so quickly. First, they checked the alleyway and took some pictures of \nthe solid, unmarked concrete of the covered entry. Then they began to make \nappointments and send me to specialists. \nI was tested and poked and quizzed and prodded all through my teenage years. \nI never believed I was delusional, not like that, no matter what my father said. \nAnd neither, it seemed, did the doctors. At least, not in any way they could \nprove. Every test, every examination, seemed to reinforce the fact that there \nwas nothing medically unusual about me or my mind. The only evidence to the \ncontrary was the fact that I kept seeing the door. \nWhen I was thirteen, it was underneath a railway bridge. It was huge and \nmetal this time, with solid iron bolts sealing it shut and a thick chain stretched", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 2, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 4471}}
