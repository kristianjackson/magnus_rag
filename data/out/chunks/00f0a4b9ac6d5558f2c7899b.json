Episode ninety-five. Absent \nWithout Leave. \n[Tape clicks on.] \nMARTIN \nRight. Statement. Another statement. (Sigh) Fine. \nMartin Blackwood, Archival Assistant at the Magnus Institute, recording \nstatement number 9770211, statement of Luca Moretti, given November 2nd \n1977. \nMARTIN (STATEMENT) \nThere is no glory in war. I learned that early. Maybe there was once, riding out \nonto the \n\nbattlefield with your banner held high, a warhorse below you, and a lance in \nyour hand. But no, probably not even then. It’s just fear. Fear that some \nunseen enemy might end your life from a mile away with a tank round or an \nartillery shell. Fear that you might look another man in the eyes the moment \nbefore he pulls a trigger and takes your life. Fear that you might have to look in \nhis eyes before you do the same. I joined up because I wanted to serve my \nking, because I thought that out there, on the field of battle, I could be the \nhero my country needed. But it turned out I was only ready to kill for my \ncountry right up until the moment I had the chance. \nThey never tell you how difficult it is to take a human life. They tell you the \nenemy are monsters, an evil force sweeping across our fair land, burning and \nmurdering because that’s all the enemy knows. They try to keep you far away, \nfiring round after round from whatever hidden spot you’ve found. All so you \ndon’t look your enemy in the eyes. Because they’re just people. \nThat’s not to say I never killed anyone. I honestly don’t know. A battle is a \nterrible, confusing place. I fired my gun plenty, and many Allied soldiers ended \nup dead. I can’t be sure none were because of me. But, I never took a life with \nfull knowledge and intention. Not during the war, at least. \nI wasn’t a fascist. I know that’s always the claim people try to make, but I \nhonestly had no time for Mussolini. I’ll admit there was a certain poetry to \nD’Annunzio’s words, which brought me close to believing in him on occasion, \nbut when he made way for “Il Duce”, I rapidly lost interest. I had no time for \nthat bald, pouting fool, strutting about and preening. I, like my father, served \nfor the King. I wasn’t happy he had thrown his lot in with the Fascists, but \nloyalty was always a failing of mine. That said, I despised Communism, and \nunder Mussolini’s rule the military enjoyed freedom and prominence as never \n\nbefore. I ignored, though, the rumours of what my brothers-in-arms were \ndoing in Libya. \nBy the time the war broke out, I had been a soldier for most of my adult life, \nbut I had never seen full combat, despite having made the rank of Maresciallo \ncapo in the 4th Alpini. We were trained in mountain warfare, some of the \ntoughest men I ever knew, and eager to see combat, even if to do so, we \nwould stand side by side with Nazis. True battle was worse than I could have \nimagined. We were trained and equipped to fight in the Alps, in mountain \nterrain, but our commanders would send us against tanks and motorised \ninfantry in wide open plains, with no proper cover or elevation. For all our \nleadership hungered for war, they had little idea, it seemed, how to wage it. \nFor my part, I discovered that all my dreams of honour were only that. The war \ntested my mettle, and it broke. \nWhen the King broke with the Fascists and signed the Armistice with the Allies, \nour erstwhile German companions wasted no time turning on us. I spent the \nlast two years of the war in a Nazi prison camp, but strange as it feels to say, it \nwasn’t actually that bad. They treated us well enough, and having fought \ntogether, the abuse was minimal. It was only in the last few months, when our \nhosts were being pressed by the Russians, and resources became scarce, then \nwe suffered. But this is not what I care to dwell on. It was what happened after \nwe were released that brings me to tell you my story. \nYou cannot imagine the chaos immediately after the war was lost. Unlike \nGermany, carved up between East and West, Italy’s division was… messier. \nThere was the South, that had had surrendered with the King in 1943, and the \nNorth, occupied by the Germans for the most part, but some of our forces had \nstill fought alongside them in Mussolini’s puppet state.
