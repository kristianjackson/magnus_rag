We checked the fuses, the sockets, Kathy even called the \nlandlord to have someone check out the wiring, but it all seemed fine. The \nlights kept not working, though. Then I had a thought. The next time it \nhappened, instead of changing the light bulb, I just tightened it. Just like that it \nturned back on. The first time this happened I was so surprised I nearly fell off \nthe chair I was stood on. The bulbs hadn't been breaking, someone had been \nunscrewing them. Not much, not enough that we could spot it, just enough for \nthem to not work. I say ‘someone’ had been doing this, but there was only one \nperson it could have been. For some reason, Natalie had been unscrewing all \nthe lightbulbs in the flat, every chance she got. \nThat was also when Kathy started to look so tired. She kept nodding off when \nwe went out for dinner and would often zone out when we were watching TV. \nI asked her about it, but she just brushed it off and said she hadn't been \nsleeping well. It wasn't until she was so tired she almost walked out in front of \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG025 – Growing Dark \n5 \n \na car while she was crossing the road that I finally got her to tell me what was \ngoing on. She said that Natalie had started staying home at nights, but she was \nso loud that it stopped her sleeping. Natalie would wander through the living \nroom and sing, in a language Kathy didn't know, and the tune was so \ndiscordant that it set her teeth on edge. Natalie would stop singing if she came \ninto the living room, but would then just move to her room and the song \nwould start again. \nKathy even said that when Natalie did leave, always at night, there would still \nbe the sound of movement from her room. Shuffling, thumping noises, and \noccasionally the sound of something being knocked onto the floor. She'd come \nclose to opening the door so often, but could never bring herself to do so. It \nseemed to be louder when she was trying to sleep, and once she thought it \nhad moved into the living room, but she didn't go out to check. So no, Kathy \nwasn't getting much sleep. She started staying over with me a lot, as she said \nshe just couldn’t handle living alone with Natalie. \nOne night, she arrived at my house almost in tears. I took her up to my room, \nand sat her on the bed. She stared at me for a few seconds and I was about to \nask what was wrong, when she started to speak. She said that Natalie had tried \nto ‘convert’ her. She had come to Kathy's room earlier that night, knocked on \nthe door, very polite. She'd seemed cheerier than she had since her mum's \ndeath, and asked if Kathy wanted to have some dinner and talk. Now, \nobviously, Kathy had wanted to discuss moving out for months, but she'd \nnever been in a fit state, so she jumped at the chance. \nThe dining room was dark. Natalie must have unscrewed the lightbulb again \nbecause the switch did nothing. Thin slivers of moonlight coming through the \ncurtains gave just enough light to see the table, and two bowls at either end.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 2, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 3008}}
