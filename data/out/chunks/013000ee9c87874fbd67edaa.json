I mean, this was a long way pre-digital and files \ngot lost plenty, but it still bothers me. The most traumatic thing that ever \nhappened to me and, as far as any official record is concerned, I couldn’t have \neven been there. \nRaymond Fielding was younger than I expected. Every other place the people \nin charge had been old, leathery moralists with scowls on their faces and \ncallouses on their knuckles. A lot of ex-military types who would lecture for \nhours on how their wasted life had been saved by the discipline of the army \nand did their best to impose it on us. Ray, as he insisted we call him, was \ndifferent. He couldn’t have been much older than 30 and he let his brown hair \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 059 – Recluse \n4 \n \ngrow long. Not by today’s standards, I suppose, but it would have sent any of \nthe crewcut authoritarians into a red-faced rage. \nHe was friendly and approachable, but didn’t seem like he was trying to be our \nfriend. He was easy-going and smiled a lot, but there was something in his eyes \nthat made me wary of trying to take advantage of him. I didn’t like him from \nthe start. The other adults I’d met on my journey through delinquency had \nbeen awful and they’d run the spectrum from drippy, patronising do-gooders \nto abusive thugs, but I’d always known. I would know what they were and \nwhere I stood with them. Ray was a mystery and that unsettled me. \nStill, he wasn’t too strict with our comings and goings and the other kids \nstaying there seemed all right. The one thing that surprised me was how rare it \nwas to see anyone come back. Most other halfway houses I’d stayed in, you \nalways had some of the older residents, those who had fallen into even worse \ncriminal company, coming back occasionally, usually to sell drugs or do some \nrecruiting. Amphetamines were the thing back in the early ‘60s, so I was \nsurprised when I moved into Hill Top Road and there wasn’t a purple heart or a \nblack bomber to be found. It didn’t seem like any alumni of Ray’s little family \ncame back for a visit. At the time, I just assumed it was a pretty nice \nneighbourhood, so probably wasn’t the sort of place my kind (as I thought of it \nthen) made a habit of visiting. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 059 – Recluse \n5 \n \nI wasn’t wrong. The local residents hated us. We never really got into any \nproper trouble, but the sort of glares we got just for smoking on the street \nmade me want to break a window sometimes. I never did though. I’m not quite \nsure why I didn’t, to be honest. Before I met Ray, I would have. There were \nplenty of broken windows in my past. There was something about living there \nthough that dulled the urge. My memories of a lot of my time there are, well, \nnot exactly foggy, but feel almost like I’m watching someone else’s memories. \nI remember that it sometimes felt like I’d do things without actually deciding to \ndo them, like it was just muscle memory moving me, or a string gently guiding \nme. It was never bad or dangerous stuff, just things I wouldn’t normally have \ndone, like brushing my teeth. I’m glad for it now I’ve passed 60 and teeth have \nstopped being something I take for granted, but at 15 the thought never even \ncrossed my mind. But when I lived on Hill Top Road, I cleaned them every \nnight. Up and down and side to side, my arm moving like I didn’t even need to \nthink about it. \nThe other kids living there were the same, at least I think they were. I \nremember them being kind of dull. Not that they were boring, exactly. We’d \nspend time together and smoke and play games and the like, but there was \nsomething about them, as though there were some things that they said and \ndid without anything behind them.
