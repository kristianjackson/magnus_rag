Been together I mean. \nARCHIVIST \nHuh? W-what do you mean? \nMARTIN \nWell, we had that, didn’t we? Almost a year of just working a normal job \ntogether, and you hated me. \nARCHIVIST \nI didn’t ‘hate’ you. \nMARTIN \nNo, no, no, no. I listened to those tapes. At one point you explicitly said you’d \nbe fine with me being chopped up by that old jigsaw lady. \nARCHIVIST \nOh god, Angela! Ha! \nShe’s still about, you know? Lording it over a nasty little Flesh domain. \nAnyway, I didn’t explicitly say it, I… implied it. \nMARTIN \nFace it, John, it took almost two years of crisis and trauma to even make us \ncompatible. And that sucks. But here we are. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 199 – Seeing it Through \n27 \nAnd I don’t want it to be for nothing. I won’t let it. \nARCHIVIST \nThat’s very sweet of you, Martin. \nSort of. \nThank you. \nMARTIN \nWherever you go, I go. That’s it. \nARCHIVIST \nYou promised to let me go. If I had to. \nMARTIN \nAnd you promised not to go if there was any other choice. \nAnd there is. So that’s the deal. \nARCHIVIST \nThat’s the deal. \nMARTIN \nI guess that’s why it really bothers me, you know? I try, but I can’t actually \nimagine ever making a decision that I knew meant losing you. \nAnd it... It hurts to know you can. \nARCHIVIST \nYou didn’t damn the world, Martin. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 199 – Seeing it Through \n28 \nMARTIN \nWe all dam— \nARCHIVIST \n(Harsh) No! “We all” nothing! I, I’m the one who caused all of this, that’s just \nthe truth of it! I’m the one whose whole life has been nothing but one long \nsetup to this. \nMARTIN \nJohn… \nARCHIVIST \n(Sadly) You didn’t speak the words! You didn’t feel them move through you, \nvomiting out of you like... \n(The Archivist takes a ragged breath) \nI did this. It’s my fault. And I don’t want… I can’t let anyone else feel that. That \nhelpless, enormous guilt. \nEver. \n(The Archivist sniffs as if tearing up) \nMARTIN \nHey. Hey, hey, hey, hey, come here, come here. \n[Martin sits and embraces the Archivist, rubbing his shoulders] \n(The Archivist sniffs) \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 199 – Seeing it Through \n29 \nMARTIN (CONT’D) \nWe’re going to fix it. \nARCHIVIST \nNo. \nWe’re just going to pass it on. \nMARTIN \nYou don’t know that. \n(Beat, as they compose themselves) \nARCHIVIST \nCome on. The others will be waiting. \n[They stand to leave] \n(Martin sighs heavily) \n[Tape clicks off] \n[Tape clicks on] \n[The ambient sound of Leitner’s room in the tunnels] \nGEORGIE \nI’m not sure. They said they were out— Oh, hey. \n[Door opens, footsteps enter] \nARCHIVIST \nThere you are. I was getting worried. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 199 – Seeing it Through \n30 \n[Footsteps, and Melanie folds her mobility cane] \nMELANIE \nWe were scouting. I was showing Basira where we think the gas mainline is. \nMARTIN \nAnd? \nBASIRA \nNot good. You know those eye things? \nARCHIVIST \nThe old archivists? \nBASIRA \nYeah. I think they know something’s up. Place is crawling with them, it’s like \nthey’re looking for something. \nMELANIE \nOr patrolling. \nMARTIN \nHmm. \nGEORGIE \nThat’s why the stairs were unguarded? \nBASIRA \nIt looks that way. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 199 – Seeing it Through \n31 \nMELANIE \nMmm. \n[The Archivist takes a step] \nARCHIVIST \nSo what’s the plan? \nMELANIE \nI reckon me and Georgie go for the mainline, and hopefully they won’t notice \nus. \nGEORGIE \nI’ll need a torch. They might notice that. \nBASIRA \nI’ll give a diversion; I’ll try and draw them off. \nMELANIE \nAnd if they see Georgie’s torch, we just go to Plan B. She becomes another \ndistraction, and I go solo. \nGEORGIE \nI don’t like the thought of you going on your own. \nMELANIE \nAnd I don’t like the thought of you being chased by manky old archivists, but \nthere it is. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 199 – Seeing it Through \n32 \nMARTIN \nOkay. So what are you going to do when you find it? \nGEORGIE \nWe’ve got some old tools. I guess we just mess with it until we smell gas, and \nthen back off, set something burning and leg it. It can’t be that hard to break a \nvalve. \nMELANIE \nJohn, you’re sure about this whole gas main thing? It just seems, I don’t know, \nreally mundane. \nARCHIVIST \nIt’s what Annabelle said, and she wasn’t lying. At least, she didn’t think she \nwas. \nBASIRA \nWell, it’s a bit late for second-guessing. \nMARTIN \nHow... \n[Martin’s chair creaks] \nMARTIN (CONT’D) \nHow big is the explosion going to be?", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 5, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 4399}}
