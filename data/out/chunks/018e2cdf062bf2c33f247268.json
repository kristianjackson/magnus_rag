A quick discussion with the agent confirmed \nthat there were some legal delays due to the manner of her disappearance and \ndeath, and she was paid up for the next six months, so they hadn’t yet cleared \nit out. So, I broke in. It wasn’t easy and the window meant that I didn’t get a lot \nof time before I heard sirens, but I think I got away with it. \nI learned a few things from this. Firstly, Gertrude lived a very minimalist \nexistence. There was nothing in the kitchen except teabags, a pot, a kettle and \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 054 – Still Life \n14 \n \na single mug. Her bed was neatly made and she had a single bookshelf filled \nwith an array of volumes, mostly on history. Judging by the bag I found nearby, \nI think she must have gotten rid of books once she had read them. \nShe didn’t own a television, but I did find something that piqued my interest: a \nlaptop charger. There was no sign of the computer that went with it, but the \nindication that she might have owned one has inserted itself rather high on my \npriorities list. Still, her home has given me little information in and of itself, \nthough it continues that to prove that my impressions of Gertrude could hardly \nhave been less accurate. I’m starting to feel like the only correct assumption I \nmade about her was that she probably liked tea. \nOh, and I looked through a handful of books on her shelf. They were very well \ntaken care of, with the exception that any time a person’s face was featured on \nthe cover, their eyes had been cut out and very carefully removed. \nEnd supplement. \n[Tape clicks off.] \nThe Magnus Archives is a podcast distributed by Rusty Quill and licensed under \na Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Sharealike 4.0 International \nlicence. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 054 – Still Life \n15 \n \nToday’s episode was written by Jonathan Sims and directed by Alexander J \nNewall. \nIt featured: Jonathan Sims as The Archivist.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 6, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 2129}}
