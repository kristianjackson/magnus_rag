Dig. \n[The Magnus Archives theme – intro – continued] \n[Tape clicks on.] \nBASIRA \nHuh. \nYou still recording then? \nMARTIN \nWhat? \n[A chair moves] \nBASIRA \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG088 – Dig \n2 \n \nWhy? I thought that was John’s thing. \nMARTIN \nI mean, yeah, a bit. You wanted to see me? \nBASIRA \nYeah, well, your boss is busy and I tried talking to Tim, but… \nMARTIN \nYeah, right. \nBASIRA \nAnd he said Sasha’s gone, so I thought I’d talk to you. \nMARTIN \nOkay. What do you want? \nBASIRA \nI’m looking for Daisy. \nMARTIN \nOh for – Okay, I don’t know where she is! I don’t know where anybody is! Why \ndoes everyone… okay, why does everyone think that I always know where \neveryone is, all the time?! \nBASIRA \nAlright, okay, alright, sorry. They just… well, they said at the station that this \nwas the last place she checked in. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG088 – Dig \n3 \n \nMARTIN \nWhen she was interviewing us. That was like a month ago! \nBASIRA \nYeah, I haven’t heard anything so I went to check in with her at the station, and \nthey said she hadn’t been in since February. \nMARTIN \nAnd no-one’s looked into that? \nBASIRA \nI mean, they don’t keep a close eye on… Well, she goes off the grid sometimes \nwhen working a case. Never this long, though. I thought it might have \nsomething to do with… y’know. \nMARTIN \nLook, he didn’t kill anyone, okay? There’s… I think something’s going on, okay. I \nactually think he was framed. \nBASIRA \nYeah, well, I hope so. If not, well… I just can’t believe I was so stupid, you \nknow? He really got me. \nMARTIN \nGot you how? \nBASIRA \nI actually thought I misjudged him. Hell, I liked the guy. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG088 – Dig \n4 \n \nMARTIN \nWait, you mean… like you… \nBASIRA \nOh, what? Urgh, no! Why does everyone think that? \nMARTIN \nRight, yeah, ‘cause I don’t actually… I don’t actually think he… \nBASIRA \nI just, I mean he was good company. Y’know, when he wasn’t being a paranoia \nmachine. He was funny, you know? \nMARTIN \nWhat, John? \nBASIRA \nYeah. \nMARTIN \nI don’t think I’ve ever heard him tell a joke. \nBASIRA \nMaybe you weren’t listening. \nMARTIN \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG088 – Dig \n5 \n \nRight. Well, I’m sure it’ll get sorted out when Daisy brings him in and you can \nprobably talk to him then. Oh, sorry, I forgot you’re not actually with the police \nany more, are you. \nBASIRA \nThanks. So, you have no idea where Daisy is? \nMARTIN \nI’m sure she’s fine. She’s probably just using her “operation discretion” to bully \nsomeone else. \nBASIRA \nWhat did you say? \nMARTIN \nWell, she was really rude, actually. She threatened to say I – \nBASIRA \nNo, no. Did she use the phrase “operational discretion”? \nMARTIN \nYeah. She said she had “full operational discretion”. Is everything alright? \nBASIRA \nI need to find him. \nMARTIN \nWell, I’m sure your partner will find him; I just hope she’s not as – \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG088 – Dig \n6 \n \nBASIRA \nNo, I need to find him now! You’re sure you don’t know where she is? \nMARTIN \nNo! I don’t know anything. \nBASIRA \nOkay, alright, fine. Just… Here’s my number. You call me immediately if you \nfind anything out, okay? \nMARTIN \nFine. Now please, we’re really busy. \nBASIRA \nYeah, I need to go. \nMARTIN \nYeah, good luck. \n[Basira leaves, closing the door] \nMARTIN \nRight, um, let’s… \n[Martin shuffles the statement pages.] \nMartin Blackwood, Archival Assistant at the Magnus Institute, recording \nstatement number 0031104, statement of Enrique MacMillan, given 4th \nNovember 2003.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 0, "chunk_count": 5, "chars": 3818}}
