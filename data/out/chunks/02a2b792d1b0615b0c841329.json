But Salesa always travelled with us, \nkeeping an eye on whatever he was moving that day. It felt like… it felt like he \nwas a part of the crew, even though he didn’t actually have a job to do. Always \nfelt a bit uncomfortable when the captain was giving orders and he was there. I \ncould sometimes feel Captain Gaultier looking to him for support or \nconfirmation, and that always slightly undermined our confidence in him. It \nwasn’t a problem, not really, and Salesa never threw his weight around, never \ncontradicted the captain in front of \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 141 – Doomed Voyage \nus or anything. It was a weird dynamic. \nWay the others talked about it, he’d been at this for a long time, decades at \nleast, and when I sailed with him it was clear he knew exactly what he was \ndoing. He was the only one ever allowed in the cargo bay during a voyage. \nI only saw one person try to break that rule, Jésus, a nasty piece of work we \npicked up in Colombia, and who clearly thought he smelled an opening. Salesa \nwas a big guy, you know, but he never really made anything of it. He always \nused to say he needed a crew to follow him out of trust, not fear. But he didn’t \nhave a problem using his size against Jésus when he found him. He threw the \nlittle rat overboard without a second’s hesitation, and there was nobody on \nthat ship unhappy he did it. They’d all seen what could happen when someone \nelse got in the cargo bay. \nMy last voyage with him was the one that killed him. Seven years ago; I still \nhave nightmares sometimes. Tried to escape it, but some things follow you no \nmatter where you go. A smarter person might have stayed off the water, but \nthis job, it’s all I’ve ever really known. So here we are. \nIt was an odd time, I remember. I don’t know exactly what was different but \nthe whole mood of the ship was off. Kind of sour, somehow. I think it must \nhave been Salesa. Everything always kind of… reflected him. You know people \nlike that? When he was happy, satisfied, everything seemed to run smooth. \nWhen he was angry, everyone would be on edge, irritable. But right then? \nHe was tired. Everyone could tell. The man had been doing this job non-stop as \nlong as any of us could remember, and he was clearly starting to feel it. Once \nfound him pouring over an old photo album. The ship was there in the \npictures, but a different captain, different crew. I asked him who they were, \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 141 – Doomed Voyage \nand he just looked at me, eyes sunken like hadn’t slept, and for a second I felt \nlike he was seeing someone else, not me. But then he just shrugged. \n“Dead now,” he said, “doesn’t really matter.” \nThat was about a month before Gantulga died. It should have been a nice \nsimple job. I helped load the box under Salesa’s supervision, and it was barely a \nfew metres across. Dantez told me it was a carpet that he’d bought from an old \nBurmese beggar woman who fed lost children to a crocodile head, but I never \npaid any attention. He liked to make up wild stories about whatever it was that \nSalesa had bought. It light enough, though, so I thought he might have been \nright about it being a rug. I don’t know what went wrong. He was always so \ncareful. I didn’t even usually think about the cargo during the trip itself, but \nthis time I didn’t have much choice. \nGantulga and I were both off-duty that night. Played some cards, I lost some \nmoney, and we both headed to our bunks. Nothing unusual, nothing worth \nbeing burned into my mind. Except that three hours later, I was woken up by \nthe sound of Gantulga screaming his lungs out. I ran over to him, trying to see \nwhat was going on. And he was being attacked, that much was clear, but there \nwasn’t anyone there. The thing that was grabbing him, trying to reach down \nhis throat and pull him apart… it was a pattern. Diamonds and swirls and \ncolours that seemed to imprint itself upon his skin even as it pushed itself \nmessily into his nose and mouth. What it was made of, I couldn’t say; the way \nit moved and shifted made my head throb with pain. I screamed, staggered \nback and fell, hitting my head on the table. I can’t have been out for more than \na few seconds, but when I opened my eyes he was there, dragging the \nthrashing body of Gantulga through the door and up onto the deck.
