There is no way to tell, not here, but they will come \nback, they must come back. They always do. They must swap out this cold and \nhollow emptiness for some fresh pain and-and torture. She longs to feel the \npain, as it is at least a feeling. But the fear has grown inside her now. What if \nthe doctors have finished? What if she is treated, and this is all there is now? \nWhat if she is well? Kelly looks to the door and waits. \n[Tape clicks off] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 182 – Wellbeing \n19 \n[Tape clicks on] \n[The sounds of the hospital corridor; muffled screams, mechanical \ndevices, and a distant distorted alarm] \n[Mopping sounds and footsteps approach] \nBREEKON \n‘scuse me, Doctor. Just cleanin’ up. \nMARTIN \nOh, I’m, uh, not a doctor. \nBREEKON \nWhatever. I got work to do. \nMARTIN \nHang on... Hang on. Are you— Wait, which one are you? Hope, or, um— \nBREEKON \nBreekon. Hope’s dead. Do I know you? \nMARTIN \nHmm. Hope’s dead. Bit on the nose, isn’t it? \nBREEKON \nGlad losing half my existence has given you a funny little metaphor. \nMARTIN \nOh, well, I mean, that’s not actually a metaphor per se, so… \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 182 – Wellbeing \n20 \nBREEKON \n(Weary) Piss off. \nMARTIN \nOh, I’m sorry, am I, am I supposed to be sympathising? After everything you \ntwo did to people? \nBREEKON \nGuess not. \n(Beat) \nWho you waiting for? Maybe I can rip them away from you. See how you like \nit. \nMARTIN \nYou’re welcome to try. \nBREEKON \nWait... No, I do know you. We gave you a delivery, didn’t we? Years back. \nYou’re one of Magnus’ lot, right? \nMARTIN \n…I was, yes. \nBREEKON \nWait, so does that mean, in there... The Archivist? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 182 – Wellbeing \n21 \nMARTIN \nThat’s right. \n(Beat) \nBREEKON \nI’ll wait with you. \nMARTIN \nI… thought you had work to do. \nBREEKON \nJust spreading the smell around. Doesn’t matter. None of it matters. \nMARTIN \n…Right. \n(Long beat) \n[Door opens and footsteps as the Archivist enters] \nARCHIVIST \nHello again, Breekon. \nBREEKON \nYeah. \nARCHIVIST \nHe hasn’t been bothering you, has he Martin? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 182 – Wellbeing \n22 \nMARTIN \nWell… \nBREEKON \nNah. Just been chattin’. \nARCHIVIST \nNaturally. \nSo you’ve come to me. \nBREEKON \nDidn’t mean to. \nARCHIVIST \nNo, but you have. Because there’s something you want. Isn’t there? \nBREEKON \n...Yeah. \nARCHIVIST \nSay it. \nBREEKON \n…Kill me. \nMARTIN \nWait, what? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 182 – Wellbeing \n23 \nBREEKON \nThe way I figure, you’re the one that made all this. So if anyone can end it, you \ncan. \nCan you do it? \nARCHIVIST \nYes. I can. \nMARTIN \nBut, but like, why would you want him to? Isn’t this whole thing like a dream \ncome true for all of you… monsters? \nBREEKON \nYou think I dream of mopping floors? No. We’re a— I’m a delivery man. We \narrive somewhere, deliver terror and death, then leave, never to be seen \nagain. Not much call for that now everyone’s in their little kingdoms. Maybe if \nwe were complete, we coulda done something, but as is... No. Can’t say I want \nthis to be my forever. \nARCHIVIST \nI see. \nBREEKON \nBesides, it hurts all the time. The Eye won’t ever stop watching, and (sigh) it \nisn’t great for an anonymous thing like us… (pained noise) like me. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 182 – Wellbeing \n24 \nARCHIVIST \nVery well. I warn you, though, it will hurt. \nBREEKON \nOnly until it doesn’t though, right? \nARCHIVIST \nRight. \nMARTIN \nGood luck. \nBREEKON \nWhatever. \n[A few footsteps] \n[Hissing static starts] \nARCHIVIST \n(Intoning) Ceaseless Watcher, gaze upon this thing, this lost and broken \nsplinter of fear. \n[The static is joined with other unpleasant electronic high tones \nand glitching — the ‘smite static’ from the Not-Sasha encounter] \n(Breekon makes noises of discomfort) \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nTake what is left of it as your own and leave no trace of it behind. \nIt.
