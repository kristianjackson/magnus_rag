By the time the Eye focuses on me I’m already somewhere new— \n[A door creaks open with multiple echoes] \nHELEN (CONT’D) \n—something new. \nARCHIVIST \nCeaseless— ooh— \n[Another shift in the building happens; the smite statics are still \nstruggling to rise] \nHELEN \nWhoopsie! \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 187 – Checking Out \n \n30 \n(The Archivist is catches his breath) \nARCHIVIST \nYou can’t do this forever! \nHELEN \nIn this brave new world? I’m afraid I very much can. \nARCHIVIST \nYou can’t kill me though. You’re just stalling. \nHELEN \nTrue. But hopefully I can stall long enough that any of your little gang that can \ndie, have done so. By the time I let you out you’ll have nobody else. \n[Smite statics dims] \nARCHIVIST \n(Beat) \nI will end you. \n(Beat) \n[Some creaking] \n[Smite statics starts growing] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nWhat nothing? No smirk? A laugh? I’ve got you rattled. \n[Building creaks] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 187 – Checking Out \n \n31 \nHELEN \nI’m not scared of you. \n[Strong building creaks] \nARCHIVIST \nHelen... Was that... a lie? \nHELEN \n(Too quickly) No! \nARCHIVIST \nA lie. A genuine untruth. Like a little bit of loose thread, flitting in the breeze. \n[Building creaks] \nHELEN \nFine. You can go. \n[A door that sounds exactly like the Archivist’s office door opens] \nThere’s the door. Just go! \nARCHIVIST \nCeaseless Watcher! \nHELEN \nNo! \n[Through the incantation, the smite static mingles with creaking \nwoodwork and crumbling brick] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 187 – Checking Out \n \n32 \nARCHIVIST \n(Crosstalk) See this lie, this golden strand of falsehood. Take it in your gaze and \npull it, follow through its curves and twists and knots as it unravels all before \nyou. \nHELEN \n(Crosstalk) No. No! No! No, Archivist! Stop! John, it’s me, it’s Helen. It’s me. \nI’ve always been your friend. Don’t do this to me. I have always helped you. I \nhave always helped you and lent you doors. Think of all that I have done for \nyou. If you do this, everyone inside me is dead! \nARCHIVIST \n(Crosstalk) Unweave it now, its fear and its falsehood, its hidden teeth and the \nones it wears so proudly. \nHELEN \n(Crosstalk) You’re no different— You are no different from me! You can’t save \nanyone! \nARCHIVIST \n(Crosstalk) Take all that it is and all that it has. It is yours! \n[Statics crescendo to the smite glitch sound] \nHELEN \n(Crosstalk) No! NOOOOOO! \n[Helen’s voice is stretches, echoes, vanishes] \n[Extended sounds of distorted folding demolition; statics end] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 187 – Checking Out \n \n33 \nARCHIVIST \nUrgh! \n[A strange sound rings out as demolition ends and the Archivist \nreappears in the wasteland] \nMARTIN \nChrist, John! \nARCHIVIST \n(Groggy) Oh, Martin! Good. \nMARTIN \nWh— Wh-Wh-What… What happened? Th-Th-There was the hotel and then... \nARCHIVIST \nI, um... I killed Helen. \nMARTIN \nOh. \nWhy? \nARCHIVIST \nLong story. Ish. I’ll explain later. \nMARTIN \n…Alright. And you couldn’t wait until you were outside? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 187 – Checking Out \n \n34 \nARCHIVIST \nNot really. \nMARTIN \n…Fair enough. \nARCHIVIST \nUm-yeah h-how are you? How was... your domain? \nMARTIN \nOh, ah, well. I mean, it feels sort of underwhelming now, to be honest. Ah, \nmore of a journey of gentle self-discovery, really. I-I didn’t realise I’m quite so… \nargumentative. \nARCHIVIST \nI mean… \nMARTIN \nY-Y-You don’t need to comment. \nARCHIVIST \nAlright. \nMARTIN \n…So… \nHelen’s gone, then? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 187 – Checking Out \n \n35 \nARCHIVIST \nYeah. \n[A footstep on debris as Martin considers] \nMARTIN \nDamn. \nARCHIVIST \nYeah. \nMARTIN \nTime to mourn? \nARCHIVIST \nYou can if you want. \n(Beat) \nDo you? Want to mourn? \nMARTIN \n…A bit, I guess. I-I mean, she was our friend. Sort of. A bit. Until you killed her. \nWhich I’m sure you had to do. \nARCHIVIST \nTake some time if you need. But not too long. \n[A few footsteps on debris]", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 6, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 4283}}
