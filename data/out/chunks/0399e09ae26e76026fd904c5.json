It wasn’t \nmuch, but it fit what might be generously be called my ‘budget’, and Bucoda \nwas less than an hour’s drive from Olympia, so commuting in to any job I might \nactually get wouldn’t be too bad. I shook his hand, and I moved there. \nThe town was almost exactly what you would expect. A small grid without \ntraffic signs or markings, patches of grass and dirt with small houses irregularly \ndotted about. What infrastructure there was boasted only volunteers, and I’d \nbe surprised if there was more than five hundred people in total who called it \nhome. The forest pressed in on all sides, like it did everywhere in the Pacific \n\nNorthwest, I suppose, but it was an effect I was struggling to get used to. As I \npulled up to Tommy’s house for the first time, it was… strange. I felt like even \nbefore I turned off the engine I didn’t belong there. Like I’d walked backstage \nat a theatre: nobody stopped me, but I couldn’t shake the impression that I’d \ngone somewhere I wasn’t supposed to be. Even when Tommy came out, and \nstarted to unpack the trunk, it seemed to me that he blended into the town in \na way I just didn’t. \nThere was no sign this was anything other than in my own head, though. \nTommy didn’t seem to notice anything off, and as I shifted my stuff into the \ntiny bedroom he wordlessly handed me a beer with a big smile. I drank it \ngladly, and tried my best to relax. \nAs it turned out my situation wasn’t quite as dreadful as I thought. I discovered \nthe next day that my work had actually paid me a small amount. It wasn’t clear \nwhether it was meant to be salary or severance, and I couldn’t get through to \nanyone who might have been able to explain it, but it was enough to ease the \nrelentless pressure, if only a little bit. I allowed myself a few days to rest and \nrecover from the chaos that the last week had been. I suppose technically I \ncould have moved out of Tommy’s place, but he seemed… genuinely happy to \nhave me around, and I reckoned my efforts were better spent looking for a \nnew job than a place to live. \nI spent the next few days sleeping, drinking, and gently exploring the tiny town \nwhich now counted me among its residents. It was quiet, though by no means \ndeserted; I regularly saw other people walking the streets, though there was \nno sidewalk to speak of. It may have just been my imagination, but whenever \nthey saw me, it seemed like they paused for just a moment, staring at me, \nbefore they continued on their way. They seemed friendly enough apart from \nthat, and there never seemed to be any subtext or hidden meaning behind \ntheir greetings. Thinking back now, though, I’m not sure I ever saw any \nchildren, though maybe I’m reading too much into it. \nI found the… pit almost immediately. It wasn’t like it was something that could \neasily be missed, sitting there at the intersection of River Street and 6th, \ngaping up at the bright blue sky. It looked like a sinkhole, but almost \ncompletely circular, and instead of the sheer drop of most such holes,", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 1, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 3085}}
