She wouldn’t stop, though. She \nwouldn’t give in. She thrust a razor blade and a marker pen at me, and begged \nme to help her finish. \nEverything was red, every possible shade of dark, and wet, and drying crimson. \nI turned to run but I slipped, fell to the floor and I crawled, panicking, down \ninto the street. I managed to stagger to a coffee shop across the road, and I \njust sat there in shock until the police arrived. \nBetween the blood on my clothes, eyewitnesses who saw me leaving, and the \nfact the mutilations were so awful the judge said it was “inconceivable to \nsuggest they were self-inflicted”, it seemed like an open and shut case. And \n\nhonestly, there was a part of me which thought a life in prison was an alright \nprice for freedom. Trouble was, whatever dark ritual my mum tried to do? It \nworked. She had bound herself to the book, and was able to manifest almost \nat will. How she removed it from police custody I don’t know, but it left enough \nof the other evidence ‘contaminated’ that my case was judged a mistrial. I was \nlater told there wasn’t enough evidence to charge me again. Apparently \nseveral witnesses had withdrawn their testimony. I wasn’t going to be \nimprisoned, but… I was a long way from free. \nShe was waiting for me when I got home. The half-finished ritual had left her... \ndamaged. She was powerful, but… erratic. Of course she blamed me for her \nnew state, said if I had helped her she would have been completely beyond \ndeath. But as she was, she wasn’t going anywhere. \nFor the next five years she haunted my life. I did what she asked, but whenever \nher form faded for a few days, I would take what little revenge I could: I \nburned books, I covered leads. I occasionally fled to somewhere I thought it’d \nbe hard for her to follow. \nIn the end it was Gertrude who saved me. She came to me when I was \ndesperate, nowhere to go, and she offered to help. I just had to make sure I \ntook the book while my mum was fading, and brought it to her, and then she \nwould free me. I didn’t really believe her, I don’t think, but I did it anyway. \nWhen she returned the book to me a week later, her pages burned and \nmangled, I think I actually cried with relief. I never even considered that my \nmum might have taught Gertrude how to make pages for it before she was \ndestroyed. \n(Sigh) I think you know the rest. I joined Gertrude’s work for a few years. \nDidn’t realise how ill I was until it finally caught up with me. Then I died. \nI think... I think I finally understand why she brought me back. I just don’t \nunderstand why she left me behind. \nARCHIVIST \nWhat was Gertrude’s work? \nGERARD \n\nWhat? \nARCHIVIST \nI-I mean, I— Sorry, I-I know a lot about what Gertrude did, but I don’t really \nknow why she was doing any of it, or w-what her intentions were. \nGERARD \nSame as you. I think. \nARCHIVIST \nStopping the Unknowing? \nGERARD \nNot just the Unknowing. All of them. \nARCHIVIST \nThere are more rituals… \nGERARD \nThat’s what she said. \nARCHIVIST \nW-W-What do they do? \nGERARD \nI mean… they change the world. They make it new. \nARCHIVIST \nAn apocalypse. \nGERARD \nKind of. How much do you know about these things, the Eye and that? \nARCHIVIST \n\nI don’t— Uh... they’re, they’re malicious. Many consider them god-like and t-\nthey have the power to affect the world in unnatural ways, but they cannot \ndirectly exist within it, so they rely on avatars or, or servants that they corrupt \nand… sometimes monsters that they create. They use their power in ways \nsmall enough to stay hidden, a-and I think... I think they feed on our fear. \nGERARD \nNo, they don’t feed on it. They are it. \nARCHIVIST \nWhat? W-what do you mean? \nGERARD \nI mean what I said. These things, these forces, they are our fear. Deep fears. \nPrimordial. Always looking for ways to grow and spread. \nARCHIVIST \nNo… B-B-But that doesn’t— I m-mean, it doesn’t make— \nGERARD \nWhat? So you thought it was coincidence that unknowable alien \nconsciousnesses from beyond our universe just so happen to basically be all \nthe things we’re terrified of? \nARCHIVIST \nI— How?! \nGERARD \nNo idea. \nSmarter people than me have died trying to figure that one out. I mean, maybe \nthey appeared out of nothing the first time something felt afraid. Maybe \nthey’re older than that, and they just got inspired by all the things that we \ndread. Did they made themselves from our fears, or are they why we’re afraid? \nI really don’t know.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 4, "chunk_count": 9, "chars": 4474}}
