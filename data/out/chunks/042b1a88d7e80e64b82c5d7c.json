Helps me get in the mood, you know? \nJust a nice thing to do together. Makes me feel close to you. \nAs it lowers them back to the ground, Francis tries again to curse at The Spider. \nTo tell it it has no right to these voices, to leave all of them out of this. But the \npain of the hooks travels up and down their veins in thin lines of needling \ntorment and robs them of their voice. \nThe Spider leans closer. Its grinning face and quivering mandibles can now be \nseen; its abdomen throbs with anticipation. \nTHE SPIDER: Oh, but I did not bring them. I did not write their lines in your little \nfarce. You are the one that brought them. You devised the steps of this dance; \nI am simply here to... help you through them, when you forget. Oh, watch out! \nThe Spider pulls abruptly on the threads hooked into Francis’ legs, and they \ntumble forward, faceplanting in a nasty-looking pratfall. \n[Rope creaks and sound of the fall] \n[The audience laughs] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nPause for laughter. \n[Laughter ends] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nFrancis’ free hand hits at the wooden floor of the stage weakly. It is unclear \nwhether they hope to achieve something or if it is just an expression of \ndespair. The hook in their cheek pulls tight enough to form a grim smile of \nsorts. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 172 – Strung Out \n9 \nFRANCIS: What do you want? \nTHE SPIDER: The same thing I always want, Francis, every time we do this \ndance, every single act of our hilarious production. I want what you want, \ndeep, deep down in the hidden bit of you you've tried so hard to kill. You can't \nwait for the dance to conclude. \nFRANCIS: I don't want that anymore. It's different now; I'm different now. I've \nworked so hard. \nTHE SPIDER: I don't care. \nThe strings all go taut at once, yanking the weakly protesting Francis to their \nfeet. \n[Twisting rope creaks and sounds of dragged steps in a \nwaltz motion] \n[The strains of a music box kick in] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nThey are dragged, back and forth and around in a series of clumsy motions \nthat, in another time, in another place, might have been a waltz. \nBut a waltz has a partner. Francis only has a desire, an itch in their bones that \nflows into them, drip by oily drip, down the slick and glistening strands that \nsuspend them, guide them, hold them. A desire which injects itself through \nrazor-barbed hooks and pools inside their stomach. \nThey don't want to want it, but… \n[The audience laughs] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 172 – Strung Out \n10 \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nPause for laughter. \n[Laughter ends with a clap of hands] \n[The music box music stops] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nTHE SPIDER: A fine dance, Francis; that last measure I barely plucked the \nstrings. Now come. Sit down. It's time for a break. I know how much you've \nbeen looking forward to it. \n[A creaking twist of the hooks] \n[A chitinous laughing sound] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nThe Spider is almost fully descended now; its bulk eclipses everything above \nFrancis's head and it swells with joy and amusement. \nFRANCIS: Please. Let me go. Just let me go. \nTHE SPIDER: Oh, Francis. It's such a shame that I couldn't do such a thing even \nif I wanted to. The man in the audience saw to that. (chuckles) \nI am no more free than you are, little puppet. Ah! If only you could see the \nstrings that bind me, that wind together as they pull me along my own path. \nPerhaps then you would not blame me so. But they are not the tripping \nthreads that we are here to watch, no. So sit, Francis. It's time. \n[A creaking twist of the hooks, and chair noise as Francis is seated]", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 2, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 4356}}
