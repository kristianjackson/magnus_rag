You reckon they’re going to help? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 191 – What We Lose \n \n18 \nMARTIN \nI mean, they’ve got to, right? You-you’re basically humanity’s only hope, huh. \nARCHIVIST \nI mean... okay, um… (nervous chuckle) I hadn’t really— \nMARTIN \nO-oh s-sorry! That’s probably a bit too much pressure, yeah? \nARCHIVIST \nA-A bit? \nMARTIN \nI-I-I just meant that, look, either they help or they just sit down here and hope \nit all magically works itself out. And they can’t really think that’s an option. \nCan they? \nARCHIVIST \nI don’t know. I know how Georgie gets about people in her care. If she thinks \nhelping us will endanger them... \nMARTIN \nYeah. Melanie too. \nARCHIVIST \nMmm. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 191 – What We Lose \n \n19 \nMARTIN \nAnd you’re sure we can’t find the way up on our own? \nARCHIVIST \nProbably not. I’m cut off down here, and the layout seems… different to \nbefore. \nMARTIN \nThe Eye isn’t, like, calling you, or something? \nARCHIVIST \nOh, no it is. But I can’t get a clear reading on it down here. It’s kind of \nmaddening, actually. Like being on a street you almost remember but can’t \nfind on a map. \nMARTIN \nWe might have to just try anyway. \nARCHIVIST \nYeah but, without a guide we could be wandering a long time. And apparently \nthere are things wandering about there as well that…hm… might put up some \nresistance. \nMARTIN \nYeah, Laverne mentioned. Do you know what they are? \nARCHIVIST \nYep. They’re, um… They’re Archivists. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 191 – What We Lose \n \n20 \nMARTIN \nCome again? \nARCHIVIST \nDid you ever listen to Gertrude’s interview with, uh, Sergeant Heller? \nMARTIN \nOh… that’s a blast from the past. Uhhh, I think so? Uh, World War Two, right? \nUnder Alexandria? Saw some monster with a wei— \nARCHIVIST \nMm-hmm. \nMARTIN \n… eye. Right. \nARCHIVIST \nI’m not the first Archivist. Not by a long way. Most of the others died like \nGertrude, but some... lingered, and, well, let’s just say I’m not the only one \nthat feels the Panopticon calling. \nMARTIN \nRight. \n(Long beat) \nJohn. If... When we defeat The Eye, the fears... \nWhat happens to you? \n(Beat) \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 191 – What We Lose \n \n21 \nARCHIVIST \nNothing good. \nI think it depends on what actually happens. If we figure out a way to defeat \nthem, banish them somehow, kick them out of our reality, and back to where \nthey came from, I might... survive. I think I’d stay more or less like this. W-\nweaker, but fundamentally still an avatar in a world where the fears are once \nagain lurking on the edges. \nMARTIN \nBut I assume that’s the best case scenario? \nARCHIVIST \nDepends on your point of view, I guess. In the long term all we’d have done is \nbought some time. \nIf, however, we find a way to destroy or, uh, eliminate the powers... I’m not \ngoing to be okay. There’s too much of me that’s part of The Eye now. I don’t… \nknow what would be left of me without it. Maybe I just die. Maybe I survive, \nbut I lose... something. My identity. My mind. My… memories. I don’t know. \n[Fabric rustles as they embrace for a moment] \n(The Archivist sighs as they step away from one another) \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nMartin, when the time comes, I need you to promise me that you won’t try to \nstop me. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 191 – What We Lose \n \n22 \nMARTIN \nI promise. \nI love you, John. \nARCHIVIST \nI love you too. \nMARTIN \nBut I’m not going to doom the world over it. \nARCHIVIST \nThank you. \nMARTIN \nAnd you have to promise me that you’re going to do everything in your power \nto live. That you’re not gonna sacrifice yourself at the first opportunity, just \nbecause you feel guilty about what happened. \n(Beat) \nARCHIVIST \nI promise. \nMARTIN \nGood. \nGod, I hate these conversations. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 191 – What We Lose \n \n23 \nARCHIVIST \nYup. \n(Sighing) Heavy stuff. \nMARTIN \nI miss small talk. \nARCHIVIST \nWe could talk about the weather for a bit i-if you like? \nMARTIN \nHa. Bit difficult underground. \nARCHIVIST \nTrue. In that case I might see if I can get a bit more sleep. Rest up a bit before \nah... you know. \nMARTIN \nSure. \nARCHIVIST \nWake me if they get back? \nMARTIN \nOf course. \n[Tape clicks off] \n[Tape clicks on]", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 3, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 4174}}
