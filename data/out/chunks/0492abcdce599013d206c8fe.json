As far \nas I was concerned, Dr Pritchard was a private, standoffish person, who liked to \nspend his time alone in his makeshift lab, or asleep in his bunk. \nAnd I did sleep. The further we got from land, the deeper and more peaceful it \nbecame. I still dreamed, of course, but I would just wander the empty deck of \nthe ship, drinking in the quiet atmosphere of the place. I did have to force \nmyself not to look over the railing in my dreams. Once or twice, while staring \nat the peaceful dream water, I almost felt like I could see something moving \ndeep, deep below the surface, impossibly huge and dark. I quickly learned the \nlesson to remain fully focused upon the ship when I dreamed. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 121 – Far Away \n \n9 \n \nOf course, the more rest I got, the more lucid I became. I was thinking more \nclearly than I had in months, and the absolute foolishness of what I’d done to \nget there was starting to sink in. There was exactly no way that they wouldn’t \nfigure out that I did not have a doctorate in chemistry or suchlike, and when \nthat happened, I had no idea what I was going to do. I spent days trying to \nthink of some sort of plan, but in the end, the best I could come up with was \njust to wait for it and throw myself upon their mercy and hope that they’d take \nenough pity on me to not immediately pitch me overboard into the waters of \nthe South Pacific. \nBut that was the future, and before then I had months of peaceful sleep ahead \nof me. And then I had weeks. Then days. The ship kept going, powering on \ntowards a destination I wasn’t completely sure I still wanted. I started to \nwander the decks in my waking hours as well as my sleeping, staring at the \nhorizon. It never ended, but kept getting closer all the same. Time is like that, \nisn’t it? It just keeps going. No matter what happens, it just carries on, and it \nstrips everything away from you in the end, the good and the bad alike, until \nthere’s nothing left of either. “This too shall pass.” “All good things must come \nto an end.” “Memento mori.” \nAs soon as I woke up, I knew we had finally reached Point Nemo. Everything \nfelt different, like the calm I had been getting accustomed to had been torn \naway completely, and where it had been was just this horrible, ice-cold terror. I \nfelt something on my chest, coiling up my back and pulsing gently around my \nthroat. I didn’t need to look down to know what it was. In a second, I was out \nof my bunk and charging onto the deck, just to see veins, dark and cold and \nbigger by far than any I had ever seen, rise up from the water below us. They \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 121 – Far Away \n \n10 \n \ntowered over the ship for just a second before starting to wrap themselves \naround it. For a moment, the embrace almost looked like affectionate. \nThe rest of the crew didn’t seem to notice, walking through those immense \ngrasping tendrils like they weren’t there at all, even as the smaller branching \ncords stretched off and wrapped around each one of them in turn. And the \nsoft, icy flesh that wrapped around me kept gripping me tighter and tighter, \nuntil I could barely move. I wanted to scream, but the others were already \nstaring at me as if I were screaming obscenities. Perhaps I was. \nAt that moment, a sudden calm came over me. I understood it all. I could \nfollow the line of the huge veins that encased the ship, down into the water, \nleading off to a point almost a mile from the south-east. There. That was it. \nThat was our fate. Where we would always be, because I was going to take us \nthere. Running was pointless. To try to escape from my task would only serve \nto fulfil another. I finally understood what I needed to do. \nI couldn’t steer a ship myself, of course, but there were plenty of other people \non board who could, as long as I could persuade them, which I did, to a point. I \ndon’t know where I got the gun, but once Captain Macaby was dead the others \nwere very keen to sail wherever I wanted. The doom held me tight and pulled \nus all slowly, inevitably, towards our grave. And when we got there, we cut the \nengines and began to wait. I could feel all of their eyes look to me, panicked, \nhoping for some sort of explanation. \nI almost tried to give them one, but I barely got the first word out before the \nfalling satellite debris hit the ship at 200 miles an hour, killing us instantly. \nOLIVER", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 5, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 4391}}
