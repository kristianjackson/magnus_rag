The Magnus Archives. Episode one hundred and ninety-\nfive: \"Adrift.\" \n[Theme finishes] \n[Tape clicks on] \n[Still water parts under the oar blades of a fibreglass rowing boat, \nin an otherwise quiet landscape] \n(The Archivist’s exertion is clearly audible) \nARCHIVIST \n(Weary) Come on. How much further can it be? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 195 – Adrift \n \n2 \n[Extended sounds of lackluster rowing] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nThe one time I’m on my own, and it’s this domain where— \nReally? (chuckles) Now? \n[The Archivist retracts the oars] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nFine. \n[Hissing static starts] \n[Sounds transition to the deep underwater, bubbling and dark, with \nthe suggestion of a body swimming] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nDown in the depths, there is a cold beyond cold. \n[Hissing static ends] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nAn icy, liquid chill that surrounds you, embraces you, pierces every inch of your \nnaked gooseflesh skin with its needling touch, and gets inside your bones, the \nmarrow frozen into nothing but agony. \n[Sporadic swimming — sometimes thrashing — becomes clearer] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 195 – Adrift \n \n3 \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nThe shivers that wrack your body are so intense that when you stretch your \narms or kick your legs to swim, their movements are wild, uncontrolled, \npushing you through the water in shuddering bursts. \nWater? Yes, you remember. The darkness around you, the forever of it all. \nSometimes you forget just what it is that keeps you gripped so tight, \nsuspended in place above nothing. But the thought comes to you quick enough \nwhen your lungs begin to burn. When did you last breathe? How much longer \ncan you hold out? You consider for a moment opening yourself, simply letting \nit in, drowning. What are you so afraid of? But you know there is no release in \nit. You have been drowning as long as you can remember, and to invite the \nimpossible cold into yourself, through your lungs and into your core, will bring \nno end to it, no relief. So you hold on. You hold out as long as you can, ignoring \nthe agony, straining against the pressing darkness that has consumed you, and \nthat implores you to consume it in return. \nThere is air above you. You know that. Far, far above is the surface, the inky \nstillness of that silent barrier between water and sky, motionless as black glass, \nan obsidian expanse that stretches away. You could break that stillness, shatter \nits peace as you emerge, clawing, spluttering into the air. But the idea repels \nyou. Your heart seizes at the thought, and your blood shoots through with a \ncold that has nothing to do with the water. Why does your mind recoil and beg \nyou to stay down, to hold fast in the darkness, to simply keep drowning? \n[Deliberate swimming begins] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 195 – Adrift \n \n4 \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nJust swim, that’s the key. Pick a direction, and swim until you find something. \nSomeone. Land perhaps, or just another who is suffering as you are. Were you \ndoing that already? Which way have you been going? The shivers that pass \nconvulsively through your body make it so hard to tell for sure, and no light will \ncondescend to reach down here. But still you press on, try to keep moving \nthrough the pain, through the fear that attempts to paralyse you, to lock you in \nplace as surely as the water that presses all around. How long have you been \nmoving now? Seconds? Years? Your lungs still burn and beg you to succumb. \n[A deep creaking growl] \n[Swimming falters] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nSomething moves. Something deep and old, and larger than your frostbitten \nimagination can conceive. You cannot see it, you cannot hear it, but you feel it. \nThe water shifts and pushes against you, spinning you around, and tearing \napart your thin idea of up and down. It is coming closer, its smooth motion \nrelentless as an iron bell tolling in the silence. It is close. \n[Deep pulsing sounds and creaks from the behemoth] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nCloser. \nIt is here.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 0, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 4471}}
