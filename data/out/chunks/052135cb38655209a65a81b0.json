But what about the, real world, were they right? \nARCHIVIST \nI-I'm not sure I follow. \nMARTIN \nI mean— Right, if none, if none of this had happened, if the world had just… \ncarried on? What would have happened? Was, was all that fear justified? \nARCHIVIST \nI can't know the future, Martin, not even a hypothetical one. \nMARTIN \nBut, you know what was going on, what was happening. O-out of everyone, \nyou're the best placed, you, you've got the info to make a pretty damn \neducated guess! \nARCHIVIST \nI, I don't know what you want me to say, Martin. Yes, i-it was bad, worse than \nmost people thought and, things were only going to deteriorate. Was the end \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 175 – Epoch \n13 \nof humanity actually imminent? I- probably not? But we were well on the way, \nand, it would have been the end of an awful lot of things. \nMARTIN \nSo you don't think it would have been the end of the world? \n(A small laugh from the Archivist) \nARCHIVIST \nThe end of the world. Now there's a concept. Everything ends, I suppose. Even \nthis place… can't last forever. Eventually, it will die as well. \nMARTIN \nYou're starting to sound like Simon. \nARCHIVIST \nNo. He was always looking towards the infinite, but I'm not sure there is such a \nthing. If I try, I can— \n[Hissing static starts] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \n—see the edges of reality, but, I can't hold its full scope in my mind. \n[Hissing static ends] \nMARTIN \nAnd beyond it? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 175 – Epoch \n14 \nARCHIVIST \nBeyond what? Reality? \nMARTIN \nYeah. \n[Hissing static starts] \nARCHIVIST \n(Exhale) I don't know. Maybe nothing. \n(Beat) \n[Hissing static ends] \n[Damp couch creak as Martin shifts] \nMARTIN \n(Thoughtful) John. \nARCHIVIST \nWhat? \nMARTIN \nD'you know if, like, gods, religion, the afterlife, all that stuff. Do you know if \nany of that was real? \nARCHIVIST \n(Gently amused) Really rolling out the big questions today. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 175 – Epoch \n15 \nMARTIN \n(Chuckling) Sorry, it's just, this place just brings it out in me, I guess. \n[Hissing static starts] \nARCHIVIST \nIf there is a god, or gods, or an existence beyond this world, the Eye can't see \nit. It sees the fear of it, but… nothing of its truth. \n[Hissing static ends] \nMARTIN \n…So... is that a no?... \nARCHIVIST \nIt's an ‘I don't know,’ although… people's faith — it hasn't saved them. Not \nhere. \nMARTIN \n(Quiet) True. \nARCHIVIST \nWhy do you ask? Didn't think you were at all religious. \nMARTIN \nOh, I'm not. Mum was, but… I, I don't know. With everything going on, it, \ncertainly feels less far-fetched. Besides, at this point, I'd take any help we can \nget. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 175 – Epoch \n16 \nARCHIVIST \nI don't know how kindly any god would look upon what we've done. \n(Beat) \nMARTIN \nThanks for that. \nARCHIVIST \n…Sorry. \n[Damp couch creak as Martin shifts] \nMARTIN \nLet's get out of here. This place is making me a bit too... existential. \n[The couch gives one last wet creak as he stands] \nARCHIVIST \nWait. \n[Martin stops] \nMARTIN \nWhat? \nARCHIVIST \n(Sigh) Where we're going, the, uh... the next domain, I-I've been meaning to \ntell you, but it's— well. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 175 – Epoch \n17 \nMARTIN \nSpit it out, John. \nARCHIVIST \nBasira and Daisy. We're close. \nMARTIN \nWait, what? Wait, really?! B— th-that's brilliant; what are we waiting for; let's \ngo! \nARCHIVIST \nI-uh-yeah, i-it's, it's not, it’s not going to be easy, things aren't… Good. \nMARTIN \n(Fast, sarcastic) Oh my goodness, really? And here was me thinking the \napocalypse was going oh, so swimmingly! \nARCHIVIST \nYes, alright, I just meant— \nMARTIN \nI, I know what you meant! I can still be keen to see our (slight laugh) friends! \nARCHIVIST \nTrue. \nMARTIN \nBesides, we can help them now.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 4, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 3778}}
