They did everything they could to save \nhim, but he had a second seizure shortly after he was admitted and there was \nnothing they could do. Unless he was somehow able to lie to me, this nurse, \nLewis, honestly believes Gerard Keay is dead. Maybe I came all this way for \nnothing. \n \nThere’s one thing I do very much need to follow up though. Apparently, \nGertrude was arrested shortly afterwards. Lewis only heard about this second \nhand, but she was, apparently, caught breaking in to the morgue where \nGerard’s body was being kept. I need some sleep. I haven’t seen the cop since I \nleft Chicago, so maybe I was wrong.

I couldn’t get through to Melanie, but \nMartin managed to find a few details online. Gertrude was arrested for \ntrespassing but released shortly afterwards without being charged. I managed \nto track down the arresting officer, one J. Rebbicks, who said she’d been found \nover the body of Gerard Keay, reading from a large, strangely shaped book. \nThey’d been unable to determine if the mutilations on Gerard’s body had been \ndone by her, and in the end she somehow talked them out of pressing charges. \nOfficer Rebbicks didn’t remember what she’d said, but he did recall that she \nnever returned for the book. It was sitting in evidence for almost a year before, \nas far as Rebbicks was aware, it simply vanished. \n \nI don’t really know what to make of any of this. I’m confused, I, I’m dizzy... I \nthink I saw that police officer from Chicago again, in the station where I was \ntalking to Rebbicks. I, I’m not … feeling well. \n \n(Click) \n \n(Click) \n \nARCHIVIST \n(Weakly) Elias has, um... I got a letter, well, an, an envelope. It’s a statement. \nThere’s, there’s a note, “To tide you over”.

Audio recording by Jonathan Sims, Head Archivist of the \nMagnus Institute, London. \n \nStatement begins. \n \nARCHIVIST (STATEMENT) \nThe room is hot. It’s small and there are no windows and the table is cheap \nmetal. It shouldn’t be so hot in January, but I think maybe they’ve just got the \nheating turned up to high. When I rest my arms on the table too long, I can see \nthe patches of sweat on the smooth surface as I lift them up again. I’ve asked \nfor water so many times and he always says it’s coming, but it hasn’t come yet. \n \nHe just sits there. He’s wearing the uniform of the British Transport Police, \nthree pips on his shoulder, but he won’t show me his badge. He won’t show \nme any ID. Why are they doing this? I didn’t do anything. The officers that \nbrought me here were friendly, kind. It was only after they left and it got so \nhot, and he started sitting across from me. He’s smiling, asking me questions \nagain and again. \n \nWhat were you doing earlier tonight? My job. I was doing my job, cleaning \nMoorgate station, me and Kelly and Vihaan. We’re the night cleaners, and \nthat’s what we were doing. We’d done the ticket office and the corridors and \nthe entrances, and we were getting started on the platforms. Why is that so \nhard for him to understand? \n \nHe laughs, and I wince as sweat drops into my eye.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 1, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 3480}}
