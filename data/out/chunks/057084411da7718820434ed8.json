It, it hurt him? \nGERTRUDE \nOh yes. I’m sure your master was delighted with how awful his death was. \nARTHUR \nDon’t push it. \nGERTRUDE \nYou know, thinking about it, the amount of pain and loss and legitimate \ndevastation I’ve cause among your little cult over the last, what, forty years? I \nthink The Desolation is probably very fond of me. \nARTHUR \nThat’s blasphemy, that is. \nGERTRUDE \nIs it? Or maybe you just picked a bad god. \nARTHUR \nShut it! I don’t have to listen to this. \nGERTRUDE \nHm, then feel free to try and leave. \n… \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 145 – Infectious Doubts \n \n6 \n \nHa. Now, here’s the problem for you, Arthur. The way I see it, you came here \nbelieving that whatever defences or assurances I might have had died with \nAgnes or were broken along with the circle and, whether or not you actually \nkilled me, you were really hoping to use me to restore your standing with the \nLightless Flame – murder, kidnap, torture, something to impress the church \ngroup. Unluckily for you, I have had almost four decades to prepare for this, \nand now ... Ha, well, you just don’t know if killing Eugene was the end of it, or \nmaybe I have something special prepared for you as well. \nARTHUR \nYou’re so goddamn smug. \nGERTRUDE \nAnd you’re all lazy fools, so used to it being easy, to picking off the vulnerable \nand the unprepared, you can barely conceive of anyone actively working \nagainst you, of being ready. You honestly thought when she died, I’d just be \nstruck dumb with terror, just waiting for one of you to finally get around to \nrevenge, paralysed with fear. Because that’s all you’ve ever known. \nARTHUR \nYou’ve made your point. \nGERTRUDE \nI’m pleased to hear it. \nARTHUR \nAnd do you? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 145 – Infectious Doubts \n \n7 \n \nGERTRUDE \nDo I what? \nARTHUR \nHave something for me, so I end up like Eugene? \nGERTRUDE \nWhy don’t you try to leave and find out? \n… \nGood. Now we can have a proper conversation. \nARTHUR \nYou mean, you ask me questions and I spill my guts? \nGERTRUDE \nNo need to be petulant, Arthur. If it would make you feel better, you could ask \nme a question first. \nARTHUR \nAlright. Agnes – how’d you do it? Never did understand it, not really. \nGERTRUDE \nAh, that’s a fair enough question. It was The Web. I didn’t know it at the time, \nof course. I would call it an accident, but it never is with them. It’s only after \nthe fact that you can see all the subtle manipulations. I was very new to it all, \nof course. I mean, I was, what? Can’t have been older than twenty-five. Would \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 145 – Infectious Doubts \n \n8 \n \nyou believe that you were the first proper ritual attempt I’d encountered? Ha! I \nreally thought you were unique, special. An infernal cult raising their demon \nmessiah to bring about hell on earth? You can imagine all the heroic fantasies \nthat that played into. So, I began researching what I thought was a counter-\nritual, of sorts. Like I said, I was young, naive. I somehow found just the right \nbooks, made just the right connections, and even got what I thought was a \npiece of blind good luck when I found a tin box in the ashes of Hill Top Road \ncontaining some perfectly preserved cuttings of her hair. \nOf course, what I thought was a ‘banishment ritual’ turned out to not be. The \ncircle I had constructed was more of an invitation. It let the Mother-of-Puppets \nbind me to Agnes, interweave our existences at some metaphysical level, as it \nhad with Fielding and the house. It was the most painful experience of my life. I \nmean, I’m sure it’s nothing to you, but I’d never had my lungs try to burn me \nalive from the inside out before. I survived, though, and you know the rest. I’m \nnot sure exactly how it manifested on your end, but you certainly seemed to \nget the message. I kept the circle over the years, laced it through with signs \nand symbology of The Desolation to ward off the worst of the side effects and \nkeep its attentions elsewhere. \nARTHUR \nDon’t envy whoever broke it. \nGERTRUDE \nYes. It went very badly for them indeed. \nARTHUR \nSo where was it, in the end? I spent years looking for it.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 1, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 4279}}
