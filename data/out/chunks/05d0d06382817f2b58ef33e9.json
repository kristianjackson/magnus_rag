He asked Debbie Conner, \nour Casting Director, to get him as many no-name, untested hopefuls as the \nscript needed. Bear in mind that at this point any A-lister would have killed to \nbe in Dexter Banks picture, but he didn’t care. For all he kept telling me about \nhow this was his dream project, that he was electrified to finally be making, he \nseemed almost entirely checked out of the process of actually making it. \n \nThere was one exception to this: he claimed to be working with Neil Lagorio to \nmake the spider. Now you might never have heard his name before, but I \nguarantee you you’ll have seen his work. From the mid-seventies right into \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG110 – Creature Feature \n \n7 \n \nCGI, Lagorio was the name in practical creature effects. Suit work, stop-motion, \nanimatronics, whatever the method, he was the master. If you’ve watched any \ngenre films at all from before 2005, there’s basically no chance you haven’t \nseen one of his creatures. \n \nHis early work was strictly horror, but in his prime he worked on basically any \nblockbuster that used practical effects for monsters or aliens. I’d had the \npleasure of working with him way back in 1989 on Orbit, a medium budget sci-\nfi vehicle for some aging action star. Neil was working on a 12-foot tall \nanimatronic robot that featured heavily in the climax. The picture was \nunsurprisingly a flop, but I still remember his work, how he brought a lump of \nwood and steel to life: the huge, intricate mechanisms allowing his crew to \npuppet it into motion that was so natural you could forget the back of it was \ncompletely hollow. Out of all of the odd changes to Dexter’s behaviour, his \nexcitement over working with Neil Lagorio was the one thing that I shared with \nhim. \n \nNot that I got a chance to do anything with that excitement. Once production \nstarted, Dexter became secretive and jumpy. He told us he’d set up a \nworkshop for Lagorio and his team in one of the larger empty spaces on the \nlot, but no-one except him was to go inside or make any contact with the \npractical effects department. It was odd, but everyone knew better than to \nargue. Once Dexter had an idea in his head, he would throw you off the set for \ntrying to change it. When it really needed to happen, people generally looked \nto me to do so, since I was the one they considered unfireable. And this time, I \ndid, saying that I’d worked with Neil before and would love a chance to catch \nup with him. Dexter curtly explained that Neil had become reclusive in his \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG110 – Creature Feature \n \n8 \n \nretirement, and had only agreed to work on this picture on condition of \nabsolute privacy. I didn’t push the issue. It didn’t seem like the battle to waste \nmy energy on. \n \nAnd there were certainly plenty more battles once shooting began. If you’re \nwondering how easy it is to recreate shots that only exist in the hazy memory \nof an eccentric, or to frame scenes when you only get the typo-riddled script \nthe morning before, I can tell you: not easy. Not easy at all. And Dexter’s \nconstant outbursts didn’t help, throwing people off set for the smallest \nimagined offences, or throwing away a whole day’s shoot because it “just \ndidn’t feel right”. We were burning through money and good will faster than I \nhad ever seen, even on the most slapdash of his earlier projects. \n \nThe cast really impressed me, though. Most of them were fresh out of drama \nschool, with maybe a couple of ads under their belt, and a few older faces \nwho’d clearly spent most of their lives hurling themselves at closed doors until \nnow. Most impressive to me though, was a guy called Brandon Olmar. He was \nplaying the closest thing the film had to a protagonist: a homeless ex-\nMethodist minister who’d found himself on the island by chance and served as \na connecting thread, wandering between the scenes and the vignettes of the \ninhabitants after each ended with their march to the spider. \n \nBrandon took to the role immediately, with a gravity and a weariness that I \ndon’t think could have been entirely feigned. He was the only one who didn’t \nseem excited by the movie, and spent his off hours smoking and reading \nquietly in one of the trailers. It was a shame because for whatever reason he \nalso seemed to be the only one that Dexter would listen to. I only saw them", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 3, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 4397}}
