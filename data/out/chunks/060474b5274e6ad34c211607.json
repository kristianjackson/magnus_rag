This didn’t please me as much as you might imagine, because what it \nmeant was that I had an artifact on my hands, one that belonged far more in a \nmuseum than it did in a library. I’d only had a museum worthy book come once \nbefore and the process of authentication and the work involved in selling it \nhad, quite frankly, not been worth the amount that I sold it for. Museums are \n... not as well funded as private collectors. \nBeyond that, there was something about the book itself that unsettled me. \nReading it was disorientating in a way that I can’t easily put into words, \nespecially the wood cuts, although they were just the village or the cliffs or \nempty forests or mountains. They were quite crude in many ways, but \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG046 – Literary Heights \n7 \n \ncertainly not unsettling, and yet twice when reading it and observing the \nwoodcuts, I fell off my chair. Over the week I possessed it, I had enough dizzy \nspells that I had to book an appointment with my doctor, although at the time I \ndidn’t make any direct connection between them and the book. I had bad \ndreams as well. I don’t recall them with any clarity, but I’m rather sure they \nwere dreams of falling. \nMike came in at the end of that week. I wouldn’t go so far as to say I was \nexpecting him, but I put a half-dozen books to one side for his consideration as \nI assumed he’d be in at some point soon. As was his habit, he said almost \nnothing and the cold February air was enough that he didn’t even feel the \nneed to remove his scarf, so only the faintest hints of that branching scar could \nbe seen creeping out from below it. The bulbs crackled and brightened in his \npresence and I presented the books I had chosen to him. \nHe spent some minutes looking through them before pushing them back with a \nshake of the head. This was not unusual for him and I took it as no insult. I \nturned to put them back on the shelf, when I was almost overcome by a wavy \nof dizziness. I gripped the back of my chair and steadied myself. When I looked \nback at Mike, he was staring at the Leitner book with a wild expression I had \nnever seen on his face before. He pointed at Ex Altiora and asked me how \nmuch it was. I started to tell him it wasn’t for sale, but he had this look in his \neyes, this furious desperation. \nIt scared me, to be honest, and I had a sudden sense that this man was willing \nto kill me for that book. All this, combined with the discomfort I felt with the \nthing anyway, was just a bit too much for me. I named a figure that I thought \nwas maybe double what it was actually worth and Mike wrote me out a \ncheque so fast that I thought his pen would go clean through the paper.
