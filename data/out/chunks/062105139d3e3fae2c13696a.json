Or, more precisely, a star. The chamber was small, \nround and featureless, but there were doorways leading out in a circle. I \ncounted thirteen, not including the one we had come in from. Looking down \nsome of them made me feel oddly queasy. There was one that, for all the \nworld, it felt like I was going to fall into it. Another was so dark that our torches \ndidn’t seem to reach more than a few feet inside. In the centre, there was a \ndatestone. It read: “Robert Smirke, 1835. Balance and fear”. \nI don’t know how much you know about famous London architects, but Robert \nSmirke was one of the foremost proponents of the Gothic Revival in the early \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG035 – Old Passages \n8 \n \n19th century. His work was some of the first to use concrete and cast iron, and \noften described as ‘theatrical’, a description that makes a lot of sense when \nyou look at the grand columns of the British Museum – his most famous \nbuilding. Later, I would look up a list of his buildings and discover that he had \nindeed built the Carlton Club building in that exact spot. It had been destroyed \nin the Second World War, during the Blitz, and the club itself had moved \npremises, but it looked like the underground foundations, or whatever this \nplace was, had not been damaged. \nWe stood there for some time as I explained this to the others. It took some \ntime to do so as, with the exception of Gerard, I got the impression that none \nof us were in any hurry to go down the other tunnels. A deep apprehension \nseemed to have settled itself in the pit of my stomach; everyone else also \nseemed to feel it. Then, without warning, Gerard started running full pelt into \none of the passages. I’m not sure which one it was of the thirteen. I called for \nhim to come back, but got no reply and Alf took off after him, running into the \ndarkness and quickly turning a corner. Rachel and I looked at each other for a \nfew seconds, but we both knew what we needed to be doing. I followed Alf \ninto the passage, while she headed back down to the entrance to get help. \nThis tunnel wasn’t as dark as some of the others, but it was damper, and the \nwalls seemed oddly slimy. After a few yards, the stone became so slick that I \nfound it hard to keep my footing and I fell. I put my hand onto the floor to push \nmyself up, and it came away faintly tinged with red. I heard Alf cry out from \nfurther down the corridor. He sounded utterly terrified, and I started on \ntowards him again. I saw lights from up ahead, and was about to call out when \nGerard came running back out of the darkness. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG035 – Old Passages \n9 \n \nHe was clutching a book in his hands, and clearly wasn’t paying attention to \nwhere he was going. He barrelled right into me, knocking me to the floor again. \nHe was only a skinny kid, but he was so strong, and kept his footing, \ndisappearing back into the darkness, towards the entrance. As he passed, I \nheard a small clattering sound, as though something were falling behind him. I \nreached out slowly, to try and raise myself off the ground, and felt something \nsmall and oddly smooth lying there. I shined my light on it, and saw a small \nbone. From a bird, I think, or maybe a rat. I looked around and there were a \nfew more scattered about the corridor. \nI’d fallen harder this time, and had managed to hurt my knee quite badly. I \nmanaged as just about able to limp to the end of the corridor, and there I \nfound a small, round room. Against the walls were old bookshelves, decayed \nand empty, save for a few mouldering pages. They were stained and rotten, \nand one of them looked like it had a mummified hand laying on it. In front of it, \nin almost the centre of the room, lay Alf. He was dead. I couldn’t see any \ninjuries on him. He didn’t even seem hurt. But looking at how still he lay there, \nthe terrified, awful expression frozen on his face, there was no chance he was \nalive. On his motionless chest, and around the base of the bookshelf, I saw \nmore of those tiny bones. \nThat’s where my memory begins to blur. I know I made it back to the \nbasement of the Reform Club, where Rachel was waiting with the police. But I \nthink I got some of the wrong passageways first. I have the vaguest memories: \nflashes of a pile of paper, completely covered in cobweb; a figure stood in the \ndarkness, a stranger I didn’t know but was sure meant me harm; my skin \nburning, hot, choking on smoke down there in", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 5, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 4500}}
