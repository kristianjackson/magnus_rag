Destroy the avatars, \nmake it so that the people suffering most were the ones who, who deserve it. \nMARTIN \n(Scoffing) And what? Replace them with new avatars from the people who \ndon’t want to? \nARCHIVIST \nI mean, that has to be better than those that chose it right? Sure I can’t make it \n“go away”, but I could at least make it fairer. \n(Martin scoffs at this justification) \nThe Eye doesn’t care, as long as it gets its fear, it’s happy either way. \nMARTIN \n(Incredulous) Christ, can you hear yourself? “Make it fairer!” It’s not enough \nthat you’re the ‘all-powerful Archivist’, you also have to appoint yourself the \nliteral judge of everyone as well? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 194 – Parting \n \n6 \nARCHIVIST \nDon’t. \nMARTIN \nI know what it’s like to be powerless. A-and I know you do too. And I also know \nwhat it’s like once you get a taste of— wh-when you’re finally able to— \nARCHIVIST \nThat’s not what this is! \nMARTIN \nI’ve been out there with you. I saw the kick you got out of making them scream \nfor once. \nARCHIVIST \n(Snarky) What happened to “Kill Bill”? \nMARTIN \nYou weren’t meant to enjoy it this much! \nARCHIVIST \nWhy won’t you believe me when I say that this isn’t something I want to do? \nMARTIN \nBecause I saw your face when we walked into that room! \n(Despondent) That wasn’t fear, it, it wasn’t even anger. It was envy. \nAnd it scared me more than anything else I’ve seen. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 194 – Parting \n \n7 \n(Beat) \nARCHIVIST \nMartin… \nMARTIN \nWe’re here to stop this. Not, not take it over. \nARCHIVIST \nWhat other choice do we have? \nMARTIN \nI-I don’t know, alright! I do— But there is one. \nBecause there has to be. \nARCHIVIST \nBut what if there isn’t? How long are we going to wander around hopelessly \nsearching before we end up back here anyway? \nMARTIN \nYou were the one that wanted to take some time to think things over. \nARCHIVIST \nWe can’t just dismiss this. It might be our only option. \n(Beat) \nMARTIN \nNo. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 194 – Parting \n \n8 \nARCHIVIST \nNo? \nMARTIN \nNo. I forbid it. \nARCHIVIST \n(Incredulous) You forbid it? \nMARTIN \nDon’t laugh at me. \nARCHIVIST \nWhy not? You’re being ridiculous. \nMARTIN \nI refuse to accept that this— \nARCHIVIST \n(Firm) Tough! The world doesn’t care what you accept. It just... is! \nIt just is. \n(Beat) \nI’m going out. Ou-ou-outside. I-I’ll… I’ll see you back in the tunnels. \n[Quick footsteps as the Archivist speeds off down the stairs] \n(Beat) \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 194 – Parting \n \n9 \nMARTIN \nStupid… Stupid, arrogant… \n(Calling) John? \n[The Archivist’s footsteps are now just faint echoes] \nMARTIN \nJ— \n…Shit! \n[Martin starts heading down the stairs] \n[Tape clicks off] \n[Tape clicks on] \n[The sounds of London outdoors: helicopters, drones, camera iris \nmovements] \n[Footsteps on pavement as the Archivist walks] \nARCHIVIST \nGet out of here. All of you. \n[The Archivist stops and turns] \n[Hissing static starts] \n(Attempted compulsion) I said leave me alone! \n(Beat) \n[Hissing static ends] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 194 – Parting \n \n10 \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nOf course. \n[He resumes walking] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \n(The Archivist sighs) \nWhat do you want? No, I, I know what you want. \nBut maybe you’re right. \n...No, that's— Martin’s right. \n[The Archivist stops walking] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nIt’s not worth it. \nWhy am I even talking to you? You don’t even have a mind, not really. That’s \nwhat you want, isn’t it? Something to be your focus, your will. Keeping you fed \nand placated and content! \n(Beat) \nYou got something to say? \nThen say it. \n[Hissing static starts] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nOf course.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 1, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 3656}}
