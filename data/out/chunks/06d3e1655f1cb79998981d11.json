I still have a mountain of haphazard statements to get \nthrough, not to mention that I need to keep this wretched tape recorder on \nhand just in case I encounter one of the files too stubborn to work on anything \nelse. And when I do, I have to actually read the damn thing, which is... \n \nTIM \nOh, woah, woah… woah! \n \nARCHIVIST \nFine. It’s fine. I just haven’t been sleeping much these last few months, what \nwith all this… worm business. Which reminds me, if you do see Elias, tell him \nthanks for the extra extinguishers. \n \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG033 – Boatswain’s Call \n5 \n \nTIM \nOh, yeah. Yeah, sure. It’s getting bad. I mean, Martin keeps showing me his \ntongue and asking if it “looks infested”. Um. So what do you want me to do \nabout these errors? \n \nARCHIVIST \nI really don’t care. Put a Post-It on the tapes or something. I’m not re-recording \nthem. Now if you’ll excuse me... \n \nTIM \nOh, yeah, sure, yep, I’ll let you get back to it. \n \n{DOOR CLOSES] \n \nARCHIVIST \nRight. Oh, still running? Okay. Statement of Carlita Sloane, regarding her work \non a container ship travelling to Southampton from Porto do Itaqui. Original \nstatement given January the 2nd 2011. Audio recording by Jonathan Sims, \nHead Archivist of the Magnus Institute, London. Statement begins. \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nI’ve been working the shipping routes for years now, so I know there’s plenty \nof messed up things can happen out there. You remember the old saying \n‘worse things happen at sea’? Well, let me tell you it’s just as true now as it \never was. But I’ve never seen weird like I saw when serving on the Tundra. I \ndidn’t even want the job, really, but I didn’t have a lot of choice. We’d just hit \nPorto do Itaqui in Brazil in late November of last year when the ship I was on \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG033 – Boatswain’s Call \n6 \n \ngot stopped because of ‘cargo irregularities’. I don’t know what it was. Might \nhave been drugs, human trafficking, might have just been a crooked harbour \nmaster looking for a kickback, but it didn’t really matter. Point was I had to \njump ship. \nThis wasn’t an easy thing, though. A sailor’s union should be recognised \nanywhere in the world, but when it came down to it, my membership of \nNautilus, a UK union, meant nothing when I was trying to get a place on a \ncargo run coming out of Brazil. Didn’t help that I’m a woman. A lot of people \ndon’t think shipping is a job for women. Hell, a lot of people who work on ships \ndon’t think it is. You don’t see a lot of us in the trade, and every ounce of \nrespect I got, some dick-waving asshole probably bled for. But that’s fine, I can \nhold my own, and it hasn’t been such a problem since I shaved my head. It was \nenough to keep me on land for a good few days, though, as I tried to find \nanother ship to take me on. Well, that and my bad Spanish. \nI’m sure I don’t need to tell you how relieved I was when I heard that a British \nship had made port. The Tundra. Now at that point I was starting to get a bit \ndesperate, so I was keen to go to the captain and just about beg passage. \nScrew my qualifications, if needed I’d sign on as a workaway. I could find a \nbetter position once I was somewhere I spoke the language properly. \nI eventually found the captain in a small bar in one of the seedier areas of the \ndockside. I’d been told his name was Peter Lukas, but to be honest I wouldn’t \nhave needed his name – he was the only white guy in the place. Even by those \nstandards he was very pale, weirdly so for someone who apparently lived their \nlife on the sea. He sat there at a small table, completely alone, drinking a cup \nof black coffee. He was staring into the distance, and didn’t seem to notice \nanything going on around him. I sat down opposite and coughed.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 1, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 3925}}
