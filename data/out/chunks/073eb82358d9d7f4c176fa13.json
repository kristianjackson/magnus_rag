Admittedly, if Martin \nspeaks Polish in the same way he “speaks Latin” then he might be talking \nnonsense again, but I’ve looked it up and it appears to check out. I can’t find \nanything conclusive on the phrase “the lightless flame” however; it crops up in \na lot of different contexts throughout various esoteric literatures. \nIt has not escaped my notice that this is the second time Gerard Keay has \nturned up in this Archive. I’d be very keen to get his statement, but \nunfortunately it looks like he passed away from a brain tumour late last year. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG012 – First Aid \n12 \n \nWe’re doing further research into him, though, and if we’re lucky maybe we \nalready have a statement from him tucked away somewhere in these damn \nfiles. \nWe contacted Ms. Saraki to see if she wanted to make a follow-up statement \nbut she declined. Apparently she still gets the watched feeling occasionally, but \naside from that there haven’t been any other abnormal occurrences in her \nprofessional or personal life. \nOne final note, Sasha has finally been able to access the hospital’s CCTV \nfootage for the night of 23rd December 2011, and it shows something quite \nstartling. I had assumed that there was a significant hallucinatory element to \nMs. Saraki’s story, and indeed the ward where Gerard Keay was admitted \ndidn’t have a camera, but the Accident and Emergency waiting room did. At \n03:11:22 it shows everybody in that room, which I personally counted at 28 \npeople, standing up and calmly filing out of the doors. After this, Ms. Saraki can \nbe seen entering and leaving three times, once taking a minute to stare at \nsomething beneath the camera, which I assume to be the vending machine. \nThe rest of the staff and patients do not return until 03:27:12, over 15 minutes \nafter they left, when they walk back in through the same doors. The footage \ndoes not contain any sound, and no alarm of any sort was recorded, so I \ncannot offer any guess as to why they left or what they were doing in the \nintervening time. \nThere is one other thing that Sasha highlighted, however. At 03:22:52, the feed \ncuts out for less than a second and is replaced for a single frame by a close-up \nof a human eye, staring back through the video feed. \nRecording ends. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG012 – First Aid \n13 \n \n[The Magnus Archives Theme - Outro] \n \nThe Magnus Archives is a podcast distributed by Rusty Quill and licensed under \na creative commons attribution, non-commercial share alike 4.0 international \nlicense.
