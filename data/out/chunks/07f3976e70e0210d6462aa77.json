When I \nwas 17, my mum, she had… Look, she had some problems and I ended up \ndropping out of school, trying to support us. I tried everything, but nowhere \nwas hiring. So, I just kind of started to lie on my applications. Sending them out \nto just about anywhere. For some reason, my lie about my parapsychology got \nme an interview with Elias and then a, a job here. M-most of my employment \ndetails are made up. I’m only 29. \nARCHIVIST \nRight. I... uh...
