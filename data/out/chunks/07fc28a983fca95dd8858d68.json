He spent the rest of the day in the shed. \nThe one question they kept asking me over and over during the investigation \ninto my father was whether I knew where the rest of the bodies were. I told \nthem the truth, that I had no idea. They claimed they wanted to confirm the \nidentities of the victims, which they couldn’t easily do with what was left. I \ndidn’t know where the bodies were, but I also didn’t tell them of the other way \nthey might have identified the victims: my father’s photographs. I didn’t say \nanything because I had no idea where he kept them and I thought it would \nonly make things worse if they couldn’t find them, but, yes, my father took \nphotographs. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG009 – A Father’s Love \n9 \n \nDuring those five years, I had gradually started to notice more and more \ncanisters of photograph film left around the house. This puzzled me since, \nthough my dad and I did sometimes go on short holidays, we never took a lot \nof pictures. Asking him about it, my father told me he had been trying to learn \nphotography but didn’t trust developers not to ruin his films, as he’d \napparently had problems before. I suggested he make himself a darkroom for \ndeveloping them himself. I’d seen one in Ghostbusters 2 on TV the previous \nChristmas and loved the idea of having a room like that. His face lit up and he \nsaid he’d convert the guest bedroom. He then warned me that once it was \ndone I could never go in there without his supervision, there would be lots of \ndangerous chemicals. I didn’t care; I was just so glad that an idea of mine had \nmade my father so happy. \nThat summer my father converted the guest bedroom into a darkroom for \ndeveloping photographs. Like the shed, it was locked almost all the time, but \noccasionally my father would take me inside and we’d develop photographs of \ncars or trees or whatever else a ten- or eleven-year-old with a camera takes \npictures of. Mostly, though, my father worked in there alone and kept the door \nlocked while he did. He seemed almost happy those last couple of years. \nI didn’t have an unsupervised look inside until a few weeks before my father \nwas caught. It was a Saturday evening in late autumn, and my father was out \nof the house. I spent the day watching TV and reading, but as it started to get \ndark I found myself bored and alone. Passing by the door to what was now the \ndarkroom, I noticed that the key was still in the lock. I sometimes think back to \nthat day and wonder if my father left it deliberately. He’d been so careful for \nso many years and then he just forgot? I knew about the dangers, but \nsomething inside me couldn’t resist going in. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG009 – A Father’s Love \n10 \n \nThere were no photos stored there. To this day I don’t know where my father \nkept his developed pictures. But there were about a dozen images hung out to \ndry. They’re still vivid in my mind – black and white and washed in the deep \nred of the darkroom. Each photo was of a person’s face, close up and \nexpressionless, their eyes were dull and glassy. I had never seen corpses \nbefore, so didn’t really understand what I was looking at. On each face were \nthick black lines that formed these symbols that I didn’t recognise but they \nwere clearly drawn on the faces themselves, not just on the photographs. I \ndon’t remember the symbols in any great detail, I’m afraid, just the faces that \nthey were drawn onto, though they weren’t people I recognised. Nor did they \nmatch any of the photos the police showed me later. I never went back in the \ndarkroom after I closed and locked the door behind me that day. I spent the \nnext weeks wondering if I should tell my father what I had seen. I didn’t know \nwhat I had seen, not really, but it felt like a bad secret and I didn’t know what \nto do. \nFinally, I decided to tell him. He was drinking on the sofa at the time, and he \nturned off the television as soon as I mentioned going into the darkroom. He \ndidn’t say a word as I told him what I’d seen, just looked at me with an \nexpression on his face I’d never seen before. When I was finished, he stood up \nand walked towards me, before taking me in his arms and giving me the last \nand longest hug I would ever get from him. He asked me not to hate him, and \ntold me it would soon be over, then turned to go. I had no idea what he was \ntalking about but, when I asked, he just said that I needed to stay in my room \nuntil he got back. Then he left. \nI did what I", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 5, "chunk_count": 10, "chars": 4499}}
