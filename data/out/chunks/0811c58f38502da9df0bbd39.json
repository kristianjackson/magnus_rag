Sure \nenough, there, sat behind thick iron bars, was the vivid, orange face of a tiger. \nIt regarded me with narrowed eyes, though it remained still. I was entranced. \nIts fur was shiny and thick, and its mouth curled open to reveal long teeth of \nbrilliant white. I had seen bears and lions before, and once even an elephant, \nbut I’d never seen a real-life tiger before. I leant closer, until all that was \nbetween us were six inches and some rusty iron bars. \nAs I stared at this beautiful creature in front of me, it moved its head. It was \nthe strangest thing to watch. It seemed to shift its position slowly, like a doll \nhaving its joints twisted, but its face remained completely still.

Without warning it roared, the \nsame powerful cry of violence that I had heard before, but as it did so I fell \nback in surprise. The tiger’s mouth had not moved. \nAs I scrambled back, I felt a large hand on my shoulder, and looked up to see \ntwo huge men in overalls. They lifted me easily, so my feet hung almost two \nfeet from the ground. They talked fast, crude Russian, and their words seemed \nto shift back and forth between them, telling me that behind the tent was off \nlimits, and that I should leave the tiger alone as it wasn’t ready to perform yet. \nAt least, that’s what I thought they’d said at the time. It was only later that it \nstruck me their exact phrase had been that the tiger “wasn’t finished”. They \ncarried me back to my father and placed me down next to him. He thanked \nthem, and asked me if I’d seen my brother. \nIvan had not returned after he ran off through the gate, and my father was \ngrowing concerned. He was standing talking to a pale man in a flamboyant red \ncoat, whom I took to be the ringmaster. This brightly-dressed man said there \nwas no reason to be alarmed, that he would ask his people to be on the \nlookout, and that Ivan would no doubt return when the show was about to \nstart. There was much to explore in the circus, he told my father patiently, and \nchildren often let their excitement get the better of them in this strange new \nplace, but they had never lost one yet. This last part he said with a smile that I \nthink was supposed to be reassuring, but reminded me too much of the tiger \nwith its shiny, unmoving teeth. \nI left them arguing there and went off to find Ivan.
