The few masters there taught Latin and Greek \nreadily enough, but no French or music or natural science. Were it not for the \nrelative freedom we had to rove around the nearby land and towns, I would \nhave had a solidly miserable time there. Even when we managed to play \nfootball, it was between crumbling arches, loomed over by the jagged shadows \nof broken pillars. For all the life and vitality of the boys there, the place itself \nwas decrepit, and sometimes I feel it resented our presence. \nI had one great friend during my time at Repton, a lad named George Denman. \nI’m sure you recognise the name, given the recent speeches he’s been giving \n\non capital punishment. Well, I bet it never comes up in his Parliamentary \ngoings-on that he has the word “Fly 1835” inscribed on his left arm with India \nink. “Fly” was the nickname the hound master at Repton gave him, you see, on \naccount of his propensity for running, and he insisted on getting hold of a \nneedle and tattooing it upon himself. This may give you an idea of the \nimpetuous soul that possessed Denman as a youth. He was always going out of \nbounds or running off after curfew, and if the masters caught him he’d be \ndragged back to bed. He slept in the bedroom adjoining my own, and \nwhenever I heard the approaching footsteps of whichever master caught him, I \nwould instinctively blow out my candle, the old dread of my father returning in \na rush. \nOne day, Denman pulled me to one side, eyes alive with mischief, and told me \nthat he had returned from his holidays in possession of a “positively ghoulish” \nbook. It was a German tome titled Die Nachtstüke, and contained several \nmorbid tales by a man named Hoffman. I spoke little German, but Denman had \nenough of a grasp for us to puzzle through the stories together. The candles \nwould burn low as, sentence by sentence, we would decode that delightful \nunease that can be elicited by a properly macabre tale. \nThe first of the collection was titled Der Sandmann, and was what I believe \nwould these days be referred to as psychological story, dealing with the \nmadness, trauma and hallucinations of the protagonist, including the \neponymous Sandman. What stuck with me, however, was a description given \nof a particularly horrific interpretation of the Sandman. Far from the \ncomforting friend of children he is so often portrayed as, he was rendered as \nquite the monster. \nI remember how the old maid of the story describes him quite keenly, as well \nas I remember my own dread at the passage Denman translated: \n“He comes to children who don't go to bed, and throws his sand all into their \neyes, and they start to bleed. He takes those fallen eyes up in his bag, and \ncarries them up into the crescent moon, to his nest, where his own children \nfeast upon them. They have crooked beaks like owls, all the better to pick the \neyes of naughty human children.”", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 3, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 2940}}
