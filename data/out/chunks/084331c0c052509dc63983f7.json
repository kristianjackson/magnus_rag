We’ll figure something out. \nMELANIE \nThis is insane! \nTIM \nYou get used to it. \nELIAS \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG092 – Nothing Beside Remains \n19 \n \nNow that’s taken care of, if you’ll all give me and John a moment alone. I’m \nsure we have some things to discuss. \nDAISY \nYeah. \nMARTIN \nCome on. \n[Everyone else leaves and the door is closed behind them.] \nARCHIVIST \nSo. \nELIAS \nCome on, John, there’s really no need for the scowl. \nARCHIVIST \nWhat do you want? \nELIAS \nHonestly? To offer some congratulations. You’re doing a lot better than I \nexpected. \nARCHIVIST \nFeels like all I’ve managed to do is… not die. \nELIAS \nAnd believe me, that is a remarkably rare skill. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG092 – Nothing Beside Remains \n20 \n \nARCHIVIST \nI’m not getting any answers out of this, am I? \nELIAS \nThe easily-digestible sort that wipe away any doubt and fear, and neatly \norganise your new world into happy little columns? No. Not from me. These \nare things you must discover on your own. \nARCHIVIST \nWhy? \nELIAS \n(Sighs) What are you? \nARCHIVIST \nI… The Archivist. \nELIAS \nPrecisely. It is your job to chronicle these things, to experience them, whether \nfirst-hand or through the eyes of others. To simply be told, well… \nARCHIVIST \nIt doesn’t please your master? \nELIAS \nOur master, John. \nARCHIVIST \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG092 – Nothing Beside Remains \n21 \n \nI never chose this. \nELIAS \nYou never wanted this, no. But I’m afraid you absolutely did choose it. In a \nhundred ways, at a hundred thresholds, you pressed on. You sought \nknowledge relentlessly, and you always chose to see. Our world is made of \nchoices, John, and very rarely do we truly know what any of them mean, but \nwe make them nonetheless. \nARCHIVIST \n(Sighs) So what now? \nELIAS \nYou were doing fine before you forced this little scene. I suggest you continue. \nARCHIVIST \nSo it was you sending me statements. \nELIAS \nA little bit of direction never hurt anybody. So to speak. \nARCHIVIST \n(Laughs) Directed towards what? \nELIAS \nThe Unknowing. I need you to stop it. \nARCHIVIST \nAgain with – What is “the Unknowing?” Exactly. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG092 – Nothing Beside Remains \n22 \n \nELIAS \nA ritual. The Stranger and its kin attempting to gather power enough to bring it \ncloser. \nARCHIVIST \nThey’re trying to, what, summon it? \nELIAS \nNot exactly. These things that touch us, they… don’t have a form of the sort \nthat could exist in physical reality. So the Stranger wishes to remake that \nphysical reality into something closer to itself. It wants to make this world its \nown. \nARCHIVIST \nAnd how do I stop it? \nELIAS \nThat is what you need to find out. \nARCHIVIST \nNo. You are not doing that. I know you have Gertrude’s notes, her, her files. \nShe was working on a way to stop this. Not to mention that apparently you \ncan… effortlessly see anything at any time! \nELIAS \nHardly effortlessly, but I take your point. \nARCHIVIST \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG092 – Nothing Beside Remains \n23 \n \nSo you obviously know how to stop it. You could just tell me! \nELIAS \nI could. But I believe that if I did so, you would fail. The Stranger is antithetical \nto us. \nWe thrive on ceaseless watching, on knowing too much. What we face is the \nhidden, the uncanny, and the unknown. If you are to stop them, you need to \nget better at seeing. And my explaining things is simply not enough. \nARCHIVIST \nAnd you can’t just give me all of the statements? \nELIAS \nJohn, even when you had them all at your disposal, you barely got through one \nstatement a week. Why do you think that is? It takes its toll on you. And I know \nyou’ve had problems with moderation. \nARCHIVIST \nSo it’s… it’s back to breadcrumbs, and statements, and risking my life talking to \nthings that barely remember how to be human anymore? \nELIAS \nFor now. I’ll be in touch. Anything else? \nARCHIVIST \nAm I… Elias, am I still human? \nELIAS", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 4, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 3906}}
