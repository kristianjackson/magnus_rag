It \nwas, to put it quite simply, impossible, and I must have approached it from a \nhundred different angles trying to make sense of it. The Earth was gone. \nAt first, I assumed it must have been an orientation change, but that didn’t \nmake any sense. The planet below had never been hidden from my position \nbefore and if we’d shifted that radically, I would have felt it, I was sure. But \nstill, the fact remained that where the earth should have been there was \nempty, dark space. I must have watched for hours, waiting to see the sun. We \nwere definitely still moving and, from what I could tell, we still seemed to be \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 057 – Personal Space \n \n8 \n \nmoving in some sort of orbit, but without a planet below. I have no idea why \nwe kept to the same pattern. Regardless, the sun should have been visible \nsooner or later. After two days of waiting, I finally accepted that the sun and \nthe moon had gone as well. It wasn’t completely empty out there – far off in \nthe distance, I could still see stars, twinkling and probably long dead, but I \nknew that there was nothing they could do to save me. \nAt some point on the first day, I remembered the camera. I focused my \nattention on it and began to scream and shout for help in the vain hope that \nsomeone might be watching a feed of it and be able to make contact. I cried \nand begged and pleaded with that camera for almost four hours before I was \nsuddenly struck by a terrifying thought. I floated over to it and gently took hold \nof the cables that fed out from the back into the wall. I followed them along, \nlooking for where they connected to the power or broadcasting apparatus. \nWhat I found instead were a pair of neatly severed wires, transmitting nothing, \npowering nothing, connected to nothing. The camera had never even been \nturned on and had certainly not been transmitting anything to Earth. So, what \ndata had they been collecting? I still have no idea the answer to that question, \nbut I did feel like I gained some small sliver of control back after spending an all \ntoo brief hour smashing up the camera. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 057 – Personal Space \n \n9 \n \nAfter that it was time to break out the code and get the door to the rest of the \nsatellite open. I had decided that even if this somehow was simply a really \nelaborate and convincing trick to examine reactions to certain stimulus in a \ntest environment, it was still far beyond what I had signed up for. One way or \nanother, I decided I was getting out of this damned experiment. I opened the \nsmall safe that contained the passcode document and eagerly broke the seal \non its container. I was desperate to get out of that door as soon as possible \nand took a few moments to memorise it. E109GHT8. I can still remember it \nvividly, as I entered that code over and over in an attempt to get that locked \ndoor to open. Each time, I painstakingly entered it with as much precision as I \nstill had within me and each time the password field read out what I had \napparently typed in: NO ONE IS COMING. And the door remained closed. \nAnd that was it. I was trapped alone in a tiny room, floating in space – \ndeserted, empty space. I had plenty of food and water, so starvation wasn’t a \ndanger, but sometime in the first week the clock stopped working. With no \ntimepiece and nothing left outside of the sun or moon, keeping any sort of \ntime at all became utterly impossible. If I had to guess how long I spent in that \nstrange exile, I would say somewhere between three and six months. But that \nis based solely on my eating and sleeping patterns, which were largely fuelled \nby despair and that quiet, aching terror of being utterly forsaken.
