He \nbecame, to all intents and purposes, a recluse who hasn’t left the house since. \nOr so the neighbours would say. I had a suspicion that he was leaving, but by \nnight, and for a single, very specific purpose. To pay a debt. While many fall to \n\nthe Powers through love or terror, sometimes it can be as simple as what you \nowe. After all, most debts are paid out of fear. \nThe hospital refused to give me his address, but I managed to acquire it \nanyway. His building was a squalid little apartment block, in such a state I \nfound it hard to believe that he’d had to go camping in order to get poisoned. \nThe windows were well-barred against intruders, and I didn’t think this was a \nsituation where I could simply knock on the door. So I waited. For two days I \nsat there, watching the damp eat away at the bricks of that half-rotten \nbuilding. I was all but ready to write it off, and look for another option, when at \nlast the front door opened and out stepped Justin Gough. \nNow, I didn’t have a picture of the man, and had been intending to go on the \ndescription given by the hospital workers, but in the end I recognised him \nsimply by the thin trickle of cherry red blood that rolled slowly down his chin, \nand the fact that, as I watched him descend the steps of his building and walk \nout onto the pavement, I am quite sure that I did not see him breathe. \nHe was not tall man, but his frame was rail-thin, and what face I was able to \nmake out was gaunt and hollow. We’ve both seen our share of bodies, \nGertrude, so you will understand what I mean when I tell you he had the ‘eyes \nof the dead’. They moved and they focused, but that subtle glimmer that \nshows life was wholly absent. All that was left was a skittish sort of terror, as \nhe glanced over his shoulder, desperate to see if he was being followed, and of \ncourse overlooking me completely. \nThis worried me. As you know, I am not by any means a Hunter, and if Justin \nGough was as far gone as he appeared, it was likely he was no longer human \nenough for me to remove him without the aid of one. And while I do know one \n\nor two I believe are touched by the scent of blood, they are… unpredictable, \nand I was reluctant to call on them in any but the most dire circumstances, \nwhich I did not believe this to be. So I simply followed him, hoping to get \nslightly more of an idea of exactly what he was doing. \nHis walk had a certainty to it. I never once saw him consult a map, or pause to \nconsider his destination. He knew exactly where he was going, and his steps \nwere slow and implacable. There was… an inevitability to his movements, and I \nthink that is when I realised he was simply serving The End, which I won’t \npretend wasn’t a disappointment. But still, I thought if I could deal with him \nand save a few lives, I might as well. \nHe walked for some hours, until finally coming upon a small house down a cul-\nde-sac near Hackney Wick. It seemed… unremarkable, and had nothing to \ndistinguish it from those that surrounded it. He walked up to the door and \npushed it gently. It opened silently, and he walked inside. So I waited a minute \nor two, watching for any movement within, listening for any sound that might \nbreak the still, humid air. But there was nothing, and I followed him inside. \nJustin Gough was sat in the main bedroom. His back pressed against the wall \nopposite a bed, where a middle-aged man lay sleeping. The room was quiet, \nand at first I thought there was no movement at all, but as I watched, I saw the \nface of the man in the bed contort and spasm, as though racked with awful \nnightmares, his chest heaving and convulsing as he struggled to breathe. I \nlooked to the man I assumed to be his assailant, but to all appearances, it \nseemed like Justin Gough was also asleep, sat in the corner of that nondescript \nsuburban bedroom. But then I saw his eyelids flicker, and I realised what was \ngoing on.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 3, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 4370}}
