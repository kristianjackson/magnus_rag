A Covent Garden theatre regular. \nMARTIN \nI mean, 200 years is a long time, but... \nTIM \nYeah, it’s him though. Or it looks like him. Or his ghost or something. I don’t \nknow why, but… \n\nI think he’s with the Russian circus. \nMARTIN \nYeah. \nTIM \nYou’re reckon they’re trying to what, end the world? \nMARTIN \nI mean maybe it’s not... yeah, I think so. \nTIM \nAnd no one told me. \nMARTIN \nYou were never here to tell, Tim. \nTIM \nWell, I am now! I don’t care about the rest of it, if anyone’s going to find that \nCircus, I’m coming too. You’re not going to stop me! \nMARTIN \nI mean, sure, sure, I think that’s actually a good i— \n[The door opens] \nELIAS \nKnock, knock. \n\nTIM \n(Sighs) Great. \nMARTIN \nOh. \nELIAS \nMartin, would you give us a moment? \nMARTIN \nI... uh... \nELIAS \nPlease. \nMARTIN \nUh, right, um, s-sorry, Tim. \n[The door closes] \nTIM \nYou were watching then? \nELIAS \nMost of it. \nTIM \nSurprised you didn’t know it already. That’s your thing, isn’t it? \n\nELIAS \nI knew there was some trauma that drew you to us, but I can’t say I ever \nthought to look much deeper. An oversight, perhaps, but I’m looking now. \nTIM \nAll right, hit me with your X-ray eyes then, boss. What do you see? \nELIAS \nDisruption. An unpredictable, angry man with nothing left but the desire to \nfeel in some way revenged. \nTIM \n(Sarcastic) Ooh, terrifying! Surely only magic could have let you see so deep \ninside my very soul. \nELIAS \nTim, I’m only going to tell you this once. Please stay away from The \nUnknowing, the Circus, all of it. I don’t believe you can help, and I don’t know \nwhat will happen if you get involved. \nTIM \nOh sure. I’ll just forget about it. Go back to sulking in a corner. \nELIAS \nTim. \nTIM \n\nDon’t worry about me, boss, I’ll just stop. It’s what I’m best at, right? Don’t \nwant to get in the way of your evil plans, do I? \nELIAS \nI mean it, Tim. \nTIM \n(Angry) Oh, oh, you mean it? Oh well, that’s different. Okay, well, let me tell \nyou what. If you want me to ignore everything that’s going on, forget my \nbrother and everything that’s happened over the last two years, how about \nyou kill me? \nELIAS \nI don’t want it to come to that. \nTIM \nWell, me either. But here we are. So, my proposal for you is this: either kill me \nor fuck off. \nELIAS \nI’ll come back when you’re feeling more... reasonable. \nTIM \nThen I guess I’ll see you in hell. \n[Elias leaves] \nTIM \n\nOh, piss off. \n[Tape clicks off.] \n[The Magnus Archives Theme – Outro] \nJONATHAN SIMS \nThe Magnus Archives is a podcast distributed by Rusty Quill and licenced under \na Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Sharealike 4.0 International \nLicense.
