The smell would have \nbeen overpowering, but by this point I was almost used to it, and fought down \nthe nausea. There was no light coming from inside, and I fumbled on the wall \nfor a switch. I found it, and the instant before I flicked it on, I realised I felt \nsomething soft and wet on the wall next to it. Unfortunately, before I had a \nchance to fully comprehend what I was feeling, I had turned on the light and \nsaw Toby Carlisle's flat in its entirety. \nThe light that came on was weak and tinged with red, but it was enough to see \nby. I looked around, and saw that every surface, the walls, the floor, the tables, \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG018 – The Man Upstairs \n9 \n \neverything except the curtained windows, was covered in meat. Steaks, chunks \nof chicken, even a whole leg of what I assume was once lamb, had been nailed \neverywhere. There were layers of it, the newest additions simply stuck on top \nof the old, and a putrid yellow-white rot could be seen where the oldest pieces \nhad long since turned to liquid. Flies buzzed thick in the air and maggots \ncarpeted the place. Looking up I saw the light too, had been smeared with \nmeat, causing the place to be bathed in that dull red light. \nLying there, in the centre of the hallway, was the body of Toby Carlisle. His \nhood was pulled back and I saw his face was covered in puckered, septic \nlesions and holes. I couldn't tell which of them had once housed his eyes. \nI was frozen in place by the raw horror of what I was seeing, and almost \nautomatically my hand found its way to my phone and I dialled the police. It \nwas only then that my eyes drifted numbly towards the kitchen. There, in the \ncentre of the floor, was a pile of discarded meat and bone, stacked almost as \nhigh as a person. It seemed less decayed than the rest of it, though that foul \nyellow fluid oozed from it and– this is the reason I'm talking to your institute, \nyou see. Everything else could be put down to the problems of a very, very sick \nman, nothing supernatural about it, but... when I looked at that heaped pile of \nmeat, it moved. I don't know how… I don’t know quite how to explain it, other \nthan to tell you that it opened its eyes. It opened all its eyes. \nThe next thing I remember is the police's arrival, and a lot of questions from \nofficers trying to hide the fact that they had just finished vomiting. The pile of \nmeat was gone, though the bits that had been nailed to the walls and floors \nremained. I told the police everything that I just told you, although they \ndismissed the last bit out of hand. I believe they had to call in a hazmat team in \nthe end.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 5, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 2701}}
