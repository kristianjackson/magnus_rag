Most modern container ships have a lifeboat that looks more like a \nlumpy orange blob than a boat. They’re designed to be quickly and safely \ndropped into the water and tough out whatever conditions the sea might \nthrow at them. But this was an old fashioned boat, with oars and a winch \nmechanism for lowering it into the water. It didn’t even look like it had any \nsupplies in it. Standing there in front of it was Captain Lukas, as silent as the \nrest of his crew. \nThe Captain nodded, and one by one the crew of the Tundra got on board the \nlifeboat. I got on too. I mean, what else was I supposed to do? I didn’t know \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG033 – Boatswain’s Call \n12 \n \nwhat was going on and no-one seemed to want to tell me, but I sure as hell \nwasn’t getting left alone on that big empty ship. So I got in and sat down, as a \ncouple of the crew began to lower the lifeboat into the sea. A few others took \nup the oars, and as soon as we hit the water, they began to row quietly away \nfrom the Tundra, which floated, motionless. \nThe sky was clear and the wind had died down, so the stars reflected perfectly \non the still ocean surface. All the lights on the ship had been turned off, so the \nworld and all the empty horizon was only lit by the moon. As we rowed, I \nlooked around my companions on the lifeboat. Everyone I recognised was \nthere, except for one. I checked each face in turn, but I could see no sign of \nSean Kelly, my scared bunkmate. Had we left him behind? Was he still back on \nthe ship, sleeping away ignorant of the fact that he was now utterly and \ncompletely alone? \nAlmost as though he knew I was about to speak, Tadeas gave me a warning \nglare. The mate reached down and took the old brass whistle from his neck. He \npressed it to his lips, and blew. I have never heard a whistle sound like that. It \nwas shrill, so high and piercing that I felt my hair stand on end, but it also \nseemed distant. Like I was hearing it from far, far away. I don’t know how long \nhe blew that boatswain’s call for, but by the end, I realised we were \nsurrounded by thick sea smoke. We should have far too far south for it, but it \nrolled and billowed around the lifeboat, obscuring the Tundra. No-one said a \nword, but I could have sworn a few of my shipmates were crying. \nI don’t know how long we floated there, sat in the dark water, but eventually \nthe fog cleared and the mate sounded the boatswain’s call again, this time a \nshort, sharp whistle. We saw the Tundra, dark and still upon the water, and \nbegan to row back towards it. The lifeboat was painstakingly raised and the \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG033 – Boatswain’s Call \n13 \n \nrest of the crew returned to their positions. Sean Kelly was nowhere to be \nseen. And I never saw him again. \nAfter that night, the atmosphere on board changed. People talked, and you’d \noccasionally hear actual laughter on board. Games were played, people drank, \nand there was this sense of relief to it all. I tried to join in, but got dark looks \nany time I asked about Sean. At one point the third mate, a man named Kim \nDuong, told me that I should shut up and be grateful, as it hadn’t been “an \neasy choice”. \nI kept to myself the rest of the way, and left the ship as soon as we landed in \nSouthampton. I didn’t even think about my pay until it came through a couple \nof days later: twenty-five thousand pounds. For barely two weeks work. I don’t \nmind telling you, it was almost enough to tempt me back. Almost. \nJONATHAN SIMS \nStatement ends. \nAn interesting statement, though difficult to investigate any potentially \nparanormal activity, as there does not appear to have been anything explicitly \nsupernatural occurring in this statement. A lot of strange happenings and \nimplicit weirdness, but nothing that can be isolated as a ‘supernatural event’. \nThere’s also the fact that even a casual search of port authority records shows \nthe Tundra is a currently active cargo ship operating for Solus Shipping PLC, a \ncompany founded and majority owned by Nathaniel Lukas. In addition to such \nbusiness ventures, the Lukas family also provides funding to several academic \nand research organisations, including the Magnus Institute.
