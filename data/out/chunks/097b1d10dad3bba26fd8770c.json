Sims. \nMARTIN \nUh, Martin. Hello! \nGEORGIE \nAnd this is Laverne. \nLAVERNE \nGood to meet you. \nGEORGIE \nAnd Celia. \nMARTIN \n(Puzzled) Celia? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 190 – Scavengers \n \n8 \nCELIA \nProbably. The, um... place I was trapped in, they took my name. I never got it \nback. But I like Celia, so… yeah! Celia it is. \nMARTIN \nUh… H-Hello... Celia. \nCELIA \nSo, where were you two then? \nARCHIVIST \nEr… Pardon? \nCELIA \nThey saved you, right? From one of the nightmares? So, what was it? \nARCHIVIST \nOh… \nLAVERNE \nCelia, don’t push. They can tell us when they’re ready. \n(Discomfited sounds from Martin) \nGEORGIE \nUh, no, they’re, they’re not um— \nWe didn’t rescue them. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 190 – Scavengers \n \n9 \nCELIA \nHuh? \nLAVERNE \nNo? So where did they come from? \nMELANIE \n(Pointedly) Great question. John, do you want to field that one? \n(Chuckle from Georgie) \nARCHIVIST \nUh, right, okay. Well, um… We were... We’re from out there. We’ve been \nwandering the world. Seeing… all its horrors. \nLAVERNE \nGod, that sounds awful. \nMARTIN \nEr… Yeah. \nARCHIVIST \nBut we’re old friends of your… uh, prophets. \nCELIA \n(Embarrassed) Oh, um… they don’t like it when you call them that. \nMELANIE \n(Emphatically) We haven’t prophesied anything. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 190 – Scavengers \n \n10 \nARCHIVIST \nWell, that’s a fair point. I suppose, technically, ‘saviours’ would be the \ncorrect— \nMELANIE \nOh shut up! John! \nGEORGIE \nAnyway… they’re passing through. They won’t be staying with us long. \nMARTIN \nOh, er, right. Yes. \nLAVERNE \nHang on... Sims... \nMelanie, this isn’t your old boss? \nARCHIVIST \nI- What? \nMELANIE \nI used to talk about you in therapy. \nARCHIVIST \nOh. Oh! Oh, I- I suppose that makes sense. \nGEORGIE \nHmmm. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 190 – Scavengers \n \n11 \nLAVERNE \nSmall world… Nice to finally put a face to the name. \nARCHIVIST \nUh, yes. \nYes. \nCELIA \n(Drawn out) Right. \nOh, Georgie, I mean to— Sorry, um, just— \n[Plastic rustles] \n[Close handling noises as she picks up the tape recorder] \nCELIA (CONT’D) \nDo you know what this is doing here? I haven’t seen it before, and you’re \nalways saying to tell you anything weird so… \n(Sharp breaths from some ex-Institute members) \nGEORGIE \nI see... \nThank you Celia. Could you turn that off, please. \n[Footsteps] \nGEORGIE (CONT’D) \n(Brusquely) John, a word? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 190 – Scavengers \n \n12 \n[Tape clicks off] \n[Tape clicks on] \n[A tunnel location near muffled running machines] \nGEORGIE \nYeah, look and I understand that, but you’ve got to realise this isn’t just— \nARCHIVIST \nUh, Georgie? \nGEORGIE \nOh, seriously? For fu- \n[Tape clicks off] \n[Tape clicks on] \n[Tunnel location continues] \nGEORGIE \nNo, they can piss off! No! I refuse. \n[Tape clicks off] \n[Tape clicks on] \n[Tunnel location continues] \n[Repeated sounds of enthusiastic tape recorder smashing] \nGEORGIE \nI can do this all day! \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 190 – Scavengers \n \n13 \n(The Archivist sighs) \n[Tape clicks off] \n[Tape clicks on] \n[Tunnel location continues] \n[Pacing sounds for a short time] \nGEORGIE \n(Breathlessly) For god’s sake! \nARCHIVIST \nGeorgie, it’s not going to make a difference. \nGEORGIE \nI’m not going to let us be spied on, John! \nARCHIVIST \nLook, the tunnels offer some protection, but clearly not enough to stop \nwhatever is manifesting these recorders. If you smash this one, they’ll just \nmake another one. Trust me on this, you need to let it go. \n(Disgruntled sound from Georgie while taking moment to recompose) \nGEORGIE \nThere are seven with us now. \n(Sigh) It used to be more, a lot more. But... um, we got greedy, pulled too \nmany out. We… attracted attention. And… well, now there are seven. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 190 – Scavengers \n \n14 \nARCHIVIST \nI’m sorry. I didn’t know. \nGEORGIE \nMartin said you knew everything now. \nARCHIVIST \nNot everything. Between the tunnels, and your and Melanie’s... position \nrelative to The Eye... I’m a bit in the dark here. \nGEORGIE \nNo pun intended. \nARCHIVIST \nSure. \nGEORGIE \n…So what? You, just, want me to just leave the tapes running and hope? \nARCHIVIST \nI want you to accept that trying to stop them listening is only going to frustrate \nyou. \nGEORGIE \nJust promise me these things aren’t going to harm my people.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 1, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 4287}}
