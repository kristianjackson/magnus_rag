The show is pretty standard \nstuff – we head to the location after dark, we explore a bit, we set up the \nequipment, and then, of course, we spend some time afterwards analysing the \ndata and… \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nSeeing ghosts? \n \nMELANIE \nWell, yeah. Y’know what? Sometimes, sure. We do. We get evidence. Anyway, \nwe’d been angling to go into the CMH for months, er, but I couldn’t get \npermission. Apparently there’s asbestos in the walls; it makes it “too much of a \nhealth and safety hazard”. It was due to be pulled down and turned into a \nhousing development in June, though, so we were on a bit of deadline. Luckily, \nwe’re an independent show. I don’t have anyone breathing down my neck or \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG028 – Skin Tight \n5 \n \nchecking my legals about this sort of thing. And it wouldn’t be the first time \nthat we were going to do something… \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nIllegal? \n \nMELANIE \nUnorthodox! And hey, the worst that we’ve ever got before was a fine, so we \nfigured it wasn’t going to be too much of a problem. The team going in was \nmeant to be me, my co-host Andy… \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nFull names, please. \n \nMELANIE \nMy co-host, Andy Caine, as well as Peter Warhol on sound and Antonia Farron, \ner, Toni, doing camera work. Thing is Pete got cold feet a few days before we \nwere due to head out. Apparently he just wasn’t comfortable with the \npossibility of asbestos. I guess I can understand, but it meant we were down a \nsound guy, so I put out feelers to see if anyone had any contacts who could \nstep in. Well, Georgie Barker, who hosts the “What the Ghost?” podcast knew \nsomeone. She’d said she’d done a few location episodes of WTG with a sound \nengineer by the name of Sarah Baldwin, and could vouch for her reliability, \nalthough Georgie warned she was “a little bit unsocial”. I reckoned we didn’t \nneed her talkative as long as she knew her stuff, so I gave Sarah a call. She \nagreed to help us out, and I figured the episode was going to come out just \nfine. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG028 – Skin Tight \n6 \n \n \nSo, the night of the twelfth rolled around, and Toni came round to pick us up. \nShe’s the one with the van, so generally does the driving. Me and Andy live \ntogether, so the three of us headed over to pick up Sarah. Her address was \nlisted as in Sydenham, down in South London, but when we pulled up the \nbuilding seemed dark. I don’t think it was abandoned or anything like that, but \nit certainly didn’t seem like anyone was home. Andy hopped out and buzzed \nher number on the doorbell, and after a minute of waiting there, there was no \nreply. We were all just getting a little bit antsy, because if we don’t have a \nsound tech, we don’t have a show. So I gave Sarah a ring. And it went straight \nthrough to voicemail. I was just about ready to scream in frustration, but \nalmost as soon as I put the phone down I got a call from an unknown number. I \nanswered it, and immediately I heard her voice, asking if we were outside. I \nsaid yeah, and she ended the call immediately. We all watched the door, but \nanother two minutes passed, and still no-one came out. Then, out of nowhere \nwe heard a knock on the back of the van. \n \nI hopped out, and standing there was Sarah. She was short, really short, with \ndark brown hair cropped close. She was wearing black cargo trousers and a \ngrey T-shirt, with a light black jacket over the top. I… I thought that was a bit \noff as it was the middle of January. I mean, sure, it was a mild winter, but it’s a \nlong way from T-shirt weather. I introduced myself, but she just nodded and lit \na cigarette. I was about to say that we’d prefer she didn’t smoke in the van, \nbut she’d already opened up the back door and climbed inside, puffing away. I \nremembered Georgie’s warning that she was ‘a little bit unsocial’ and kicked \nmyself for not asking more about it. Still, she was here now, we had a sound \ntech, so we were going to be able to have an episode.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 1, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 3949}}
