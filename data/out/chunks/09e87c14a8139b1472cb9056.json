I wonder is there anyone connected \nto the supernatural that she was not on first name terms with? I suppose if you \nspend fifty years as the focal point of horrors, eventually everyone ends up \nknowing you. Or dead. Or… both. \nI know there are more important things to be doing, but I did ask Basira to \nhave a quick search for Justin Gough, see what might have happened to him. \nThere are records of his residence in an East London care facility until 2015, \nwhen he disappears from their records. Several deaths among the staff \n\napparently occurred at roughly the same time. And it will come as no surprise \nthat the inquest returned a verdict of carbon monoxide poisoning in each case. \nI’m not too concerned, to be honest, my dreams are, uh... well, let’s just say I \ndon’t think they're going be letting anyone else in any time soon. \nEnd recording. \n[Tape clicks off.] \n[The Magnus Archives Theme – Outro] \nJONATHAN SIMS \nThe Magnus Archives is a podcast distributed by Rusty Quill and licenced under \na Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Sharealike 4.0 International \nLicense.
