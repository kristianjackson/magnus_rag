I’d occasionally hear rumours about him filtering through the \nother inmates and there wasn’t a spooky story in Wakefield that didn’t have \nhim at the centre of it. Barely a week went by without some loudmouth \nnobody spreading word that he’d killed a guard, or escaped, or been found \ndead in his cell with his heart ripped out. It was never true, of course, not at \nthat point. I think most of it came from Dave Harrington on F wing. He always \nloved to drop fake gossip on new inmates and the old hands knew not to trust \na word he said. \n \nIt was in 1998 when– \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG052 – Exceptional Risk \n5 \n \n \n[A DOOR CREAKS OPEN] \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nHello? \n \nBASIRA \nHey, I just wanted– \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nOh, hold on. \n \n[CLICK] \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nSorry, can’t be too careful. Accidentally mentioned you on one of my earlier \nofficial recordings and had to go back over it. \n \nBASIRA \nOh, sure. I’ve got another tape for you. \n \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG052 – Exceptional Risk \n6 \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nAh, fantastic. Here’s the other one. \n \nBASIRA \nWas there anything on it? \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nOh, very much so. Um, a Russian circus that... oh, but, er, nothing relevant to \nGertrude’s murder, if that’s what you mean. \n \nBASIRA \nIt is what I mean. \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nRight, sorry. Have you had a chance to listen to any of them yourself? \n \nBASIRA \nWell, the precinct has exactly one tape player and it exploded when I tried to \nput batteries in it. \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG052 – Exceptional Risk \n7 \n \nOh. \n \nBASIRA \nI’ve put in a requisition for a new one, but that’s lost somewhere in the Met \nand I haven’t had a chance to chase it up. So, no. \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nWell, if you keep bringing them to me– \n \nBASIRA \nIt’s better than nothing, yeah. Anyway, I thought you could try this one next. \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \n‘Alexandria’? \n \nBASIRA \nHey, at least this one actually has a label. I figured you’re probably into old \nlibraries and stuff so– \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nNo, you’re right. Thank you, Basira. Honestly. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG052 – Exceptional Risk \n8 \n \n \nBASIRA \nYeah. Oh, what’s the name of that helper of yours? \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nEr, Martin. \n \nBASIRA \nNo, no, the hot one. He has scars like you– \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nOh. \n \nBASIRA \nBut kind of manages to pull them off? \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nYes, Tim. \n \nBASIRA \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG052 – Exceptional Risk \n9 \n \nYeah, what’s his deal? He gave me the weirdest grin when I came in just now. \nAnd like, the thumbs up? \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nI... I wouldn’t worry about it. \n \nBASIRA \nNo? \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \n[Sighs] He thinks... we’re sort of... together? \n \nBASIRA \nOh, oh, oh. No, you know I’m not– \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nNo, I… I know. Me neither, I… he just got it in his head. \n \nBASIRA \nI mean you’re nice and all– \n \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG052 – Exceptional Risk \n10 \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nYes, yes, no, I feel the same way. \n \nBASIRA \nRight... I mean, I suppose it’s better he thinks that? \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nI won’t tell if you won’t. \n \nBASIRA \nRight. I’m gonna go then. \nJONATHAN SIMS \nYes, yes. \n[DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES] \n \nRight. \n(Clears throat) \n[CLICK] \nStatement resumes. \nIt was in 1998 that I next came into regular contact with Robert Montauk.
