It was just me, Josh and my mother. Grandpa \nhad never been a churchgoer, but my mother had a lot of faith, so paid for a \nMethodist funeral, such as it was. It was a hot, muggy day, and I remember \nwondering whether the stinging in my eyes was from the tears or the sweat. As \nit turned out, grandpa had left me his house. It didn't really sink in for a while – \nthe house had been the most home I'd had for so long that I'd always felt it \nwas mine in some ways. \nGoing through my grandpa's old papers and possessions was harder than I had \nexpected. It was only reading some of his own letters that I discovered his birth \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG024 – Strange Music \n3 \n \nname was Nikolai – he'd always just gone by Nick. Eventually I sorted through \neverything. I had a small box of memories I wanted to keep, but… I just wasn't \nup throwing the rest away yet. I decided to store them in the loft. I knew the \nhouse had one, although I had never been inside. It had always been locked. It \nwasn't a mystery or anything, just that my grandpa hadn't needed to get \nanything from up there while I was living with him. At least, I thought so. \nIt was only then I realised I had never been inside it. More annoyingly, I quickly \ndiscovered that none of the keys I'd been given for the place were for the \npadlock. No luck searching for it around the rest of the house, either. In the \nend I had to cut the lock off with a pair of bolt cutters I found in the garage. \nThere was also a ladder in the garage, so getting up through the small, square \nhole wasn't a problem. I realised then that I didn't have a torch, and it was very \ndark. Despite it being the middle of summer, the loft was cool, almost cold. I \nconsidered heading back down to get a torch and a jacket, but as I reached out \nmy hand, it brushed against something which felt like a pull-cord. I gave it a \ntug, and a small, weak bulb came to life, and I saw what was inside. \nWhen I had first remembered about the loft, I'd been annoyed. I thought \nthere'd be so much more stuff up there, days more sorting to go through. But \nwhen I turned on the light, I saw that it was almost completely empty. The only \nthings there were an old steamer trunk, a small stool and a bright red calliope \norgan. The ceiling was higher than I expected as well. I could stand at my full \nheight without stooping. I walked slowly towards the old steam organ. It was \nbright red and in excellent condition except for a thick layer of dust. There was \na small brass plaque simply reading “The Calliaphone”. The brass pipes that \nstuck out from the top still shone faintly under the dust, and I noticed that", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 1, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 2726}}
