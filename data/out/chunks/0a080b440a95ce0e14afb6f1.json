Took me a \nwhile to piece the two together, but I thought you should know. \nARCHIVIST \nAre you saying there might be more out there like her? \nJORDAN \nGod, I hope not. I don’t know. The man from the ant house, he wasn’t like her, \nnot at all, but that smell when they burned... I think they’re connected, \nsomehow. And that scares me. \nARCHIVIST \nYes... yes, it rather scares me too. \n[Tape clicks off.] \nARCHIVIST \nMr Kennedy’s statement has left me somewhat rattled. While I am always glad \nof any further closure to the case of Jane Prentiss, this seems to come with the \nrather serious caveat that she might not have been working alone. No, that \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 055 – Pest Control \n \n17 \n \ndoesn’t sound right. Jane Prentiss, or whatever this ‘flesh hive’ was that took \nher, does not seem like the sort of being that would work well with others. \nThe house in Bromley was torn down last year, but Martin managed to locate \nthe ownership records. It was listed as belonging to John Amherst. The dates \naren’t entirely clear as to whether this was just before or just after he \napparently took charge of Ivy Meadows nursing home, but there can be no \ndoubt that it was the same person. All the ownership records from the ant \nhouse lead to dead ends or deactivated bank accounts. It doesn’t sound like \nhe’s another flesh hive and yet... no connection except disease and insects. \nAnd a foul smell when they burn. \nJane Prentiss is dead, but this is a long way from over. \nEnd recording. \n[Tape clicks off. Tape clicks on.] \nARCHIVIST \nSupplemental. I... I don’t have much to report actually. It’s been Halloween \nweek, which means the research department is always inundated with \nstatements. Most of them are patently false, but the volume means that \nthey’ve called in the Archive to assist with the overflow. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 055 – Pest Control \n \n18 \n \nIt’s been nice, actually. Disproving piles of nonsense felt good, like real work, \nnot just driving myself to distraction with conspiracy theories and paranoia. I \neven got a good night’s sleep. I miss those days.
