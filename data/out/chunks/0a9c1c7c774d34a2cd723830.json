I never have. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 165 – Revolutions \n16 \nMARTIN \nThat's-That's fine; I understand. \nARCHIVIST \nLook, I'm better than I was. I used to think all poetry was bad. \nMARTIN \nSorry, what? \nARCHIVIST \nI mean, I just thought of— I sort of thought it was pointless. Just—write some \nprose and stop wasting everyone's time. \nMARTIN \nHm. What changed? \nARCHIVIST \nI don't know, I just… mellowed on it, I suppose. \nMARTIN \nThat's, kind of weird. \nARCHIVIST \nIn my defence, there is a lot of bad poetry out there. \nMARTIN \nI guess? \n(Beat) \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 165 – Revolutions \n17 \nMARTIN (CONT’D) \nI kinda want to hear that tape now, see how artistic The Stranger actually is. \nARCHIVIST \nOr just look up. See it for yourself. \nMARTIN \nUh, heh, no, no thanks. Trying to avoid thinking about it, actually. \n[A shrill scream] \nARCHIVIST \n(Sigh) Of course. Sorry. \nMARTIN \nHow much further? \n[Some nearby muffled metal bangs] \nARCHIVIST \nI think we're past the worst of— \n[Twangs of chain link fencing getting closer, as of someone climbing \nor jumping] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \n(Quiet) Ah. \nMARTIN \nWhat? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 165 – Revolutions \n18 \nARCHIVIST \nShe's here. \nMARTIN \n(Quiet) Oh no. \nNOT-SASHA \n(From afar) My dearest colleagues. \nMARTIN \nJust get back! \n[Not-Sasha jumps to the ground in front of Martin and \nthe Archivist] \nNOT-SASHA \nI can't believe you'd decide to pass through my neighbourhood and not say \nhello to dear, old Sasha. \nARCHIVIST \nJust ignore it, Martin. \nNOT-SASHA \nOh, you wound me, Archivist. And we used to be so close. \nARCHIVIST \nI have nothing to say to you. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 165 – Revolutions \n19 \nNOT-SASHA \nNothing to say! Well, you crush me, bury me in the foundations of your little \ntemple for a year, and now you have nothing to say? \nARCHIVIST \nLeitner did that. And Peter released you. All I've done to you is to not die. \nNOT-SASHA \nOh, and I would say that is quite rude enough. \nARCHIVIST \nLeave us alone. I won't warn you again. \nNOT-SASHA \nAnd what if I let you choose this time? Which one of you would I wear next? \nMartin looks very comfortable, positively roomy. Oh, wouldn't you agree, \nArchivist? \nMARTIN \nJohn, do we, do we need to run? \nNOT-SASHA \nOh, yes, Martin. You very much do. I'll even give you a head start! \n(The Archivist begins chuckling) \nMARTIN \n…John? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 165 – Revolutions \n20 \nARCHIVIST \nYou're bold, I'll give you that. \nNOT-SASHA \n(Hissing) Last chance. \nARCHIVIST \nDesperate for one last morsel of terror from us? \n(The Not-Sasha growls threateningly) \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \n(Amused) A final sip, and then we're gone? Somehow we manage to keep just \nahead of you and get away. \nGod forbid you actually catch us. \n(The Not-Sasha breathes out angrily) \nDoesn't bear thinking about. \nMARTIN \nJohn, what are you talking about? \n(The Not-Sasha continues to make noises of anger and huffing) \nARCHIVIST \nShe can't touch us. \nWe're so far beyond her now. She's just like everything else here: ruled by the \nEye. (slight laugh) And she hates it. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 165 – Revolutions \n21 \nNOT-SASHA \n(Quickly, angry) Of course you want to wallow in my shame like your voyeur \nmaster! Do you know how it feels? To be, anonymous? And yet known! To \nhave all the sweetest dread I can create tainted by the relentless gaze of that \ndamned Eye. I've suffered enough. \nARCHIVIST \nPathetic. \n[Backpack zippers click as the Archivist turns to go] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nMartin, let's go. \nNOT-SASHA \nNot as pathetic as your little friend when I ate her life. \n(Beat) \n[The Archivist takes a step towards it] \nARCHIVIST \n(Low) What did you say? \n[The ‘Unknowing’ music begins to warp, shifting keys] \nNOT-SASHA \n(Scared) I- I,I'm- sorry. \n[Hissing static starts; but this time joined with other unpleasant \nelectronic high tones and glitching]", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 4, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 4015}}
