I looked Gordon’s dad in the eyes as he said this, and I knew that \nhe was lying to me. If anyone was going to save him from Maggie’s knife, it was \ngoing to have to be me. \nThe sun had almost set by the time I reached The Dump, and the bungalow \nseemed much taller, silhouetted as it was against the darkening purple sky, \nsurrounded by the filthy, white corpses of unwanted electricals. But that \nwasn’t right. Maggie wanted them. Maggie didn’t want anything to be lost. She \nwanted them to stay, and rot. \nYou know, for all the fear Maggie inspired in me, I was completely unprepared \nto be right about her. Not the knife, I got the knife wrong, but I do think that \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG084 – Possessive \n6 \n \nshe was a witch. In the years since then I’ve tried very hard to convince myself \nthat what I saw that night was a dream or a false memory or something, but… \nit wasn’t. \nI was past the washing machine before I’d even registered what I was doing, \nand when I realised where I was, I felt my legs begin to seize up. The lights in \nthe house were on, dim through the filthy windows, and they cast a diseased \nyellow glow that refracted off a pile of clear glass bottles stacked outside. I \ndon’t know how I’d never noticed the smell of that place before, but now the \nstench of it hit me like a wave. I gagged, and fell to my knees, not wanting to \nput my hands anywhere on the litter-covered ground. \nAs I looked around desperately for a patch of actual grass which I could use to \nsupport myself, my eyes fell on something that seemed out of place: A pristine, \nunopened can of baked beans. The absurdity of it overcame my fear for just a \nsecond, and I steadied myself enough to get a closer look. \nIt stood upright, about two feet from a fallen grocery bag. One of the bags that \nGordon always brought when he went to see Old Maggie. Behind it was \nanother bag, and another, and another, until I saw, propped up against the \nback of the house, dozens, if not hundreds, of shopping bags. Some seemed to \nbe almost new, while others had clearly been there for months. And all of \nthem were full to the brim with unopened food. \nI found myself reaching for the tin. I just wanted to touch it, to feel something \nclean and real to make sure I was still in the world. But as my fingers brushed \nagainst it, the can began to shake violently. The metal bent and warped, like \nsomething inside was growing rapidly, bursting to be free. I fell backwards, \nnow fully panicked, and started to crawl away as quickly as I could. The \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG084 – Possessive \n7 \n \nthrobbing tin was nowhere to be seen now, but as I tried to get away, I felt the \nground give way beneath my hand, and it was sucked down, up to the elbow in \nclinging muck. \nSomehow, I managed to choke down a scream, and pulled my arm free, ripping \nsoil and dead grass out in clumps. It was covered in a wriggling mass of \nearthworms, squeezing and pressing their slimy bodies against my skin. Still, I \ndidn’t scream, as I shook my arm wildly, flinging them away from me. My head \nwas swimming, searching for something I could focus on, something normal, if \nonly for a second. \nWhat I saw instead was Gordon’s face, staring at me from the mud, from the \nhole I had torn in the ground. His eyes were vacant, and his skin was marked \nand discoloured. Then I realised with a start that it was a mask, old newspaper \nand wet cardboard formed into a perfect recreation of my friend. A fleshy knot \nof worms slithered through the hole of its mouth. And then, all at once, my \nmind snapped back to Gordon’s plight, to why I was there in that awful place. \nThe light was still shining through the grime of the bungalow windows, as I \ngingerly placed my foot on a pile of old newspapers and lifted myself up to get \na look inside. My fingers gripped the edges of a windowpane slick with some \nsort of dark oil. It took a moment for my eyes to focus on the figures inside, \nand even then they were blurred by the slime-encrusted glass. \nI could see Gordon, sat in a thick, threadbare armchair, motionless. Bent over \nhim was the thin, hunched form of Old Maggie. Tiny shapes moved over my \nfriend’s still form, as her thin hands smoothed pieces of ancient, yellowed \npaper over his face. Her dressing gown was wet, and her wrinkled skin \nglistened with a pale fluid that dripped from her fingers as she smoothed the", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 2, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 4431}}
