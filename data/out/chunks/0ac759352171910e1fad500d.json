Back then, I believed they were simply books. Horrifying, \npowerful, yes, but with rules, limits that could be charted. I was a fool. I had no \nidea what forces lay behind them, or that they had other servants that might \ncome searching. \nI was ruthless, I will admit that. I don’t know how many assistants I sacrificed \nto learn the secrets of the volumes I collected. Dozens, at least. Only a few \nescaped with their life and mind intact, and even then they were deeply \nmarked. But I was relentless. I saw myself as a guardian, a reverse Pandora, \ngathering the evils of the world and locking them away. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG080 – The Librarian \nAnd so I branded them with my seal. I told myself that if any should escape, \nsuch a mark could help me retrieve them. But I think, in my heart, I dreamed of \nmy work becoming known. That “The Library of Jurgen Leitner” would stand as \na symbol of courage and protection. Hubris. I suppose it is fitting punishment \nthat my name has become a watchword for evil, spoken by those who only \nknow it as marking the darkest, most terrible of secrets. \nMy name has become a curse. \nARCHIVIST \nTell me from the beginning. \nLEITNER \nI was born the heir to great wealth. My family used to deal in manufacture: \nsteel, textiles, all sorts. But, by my time, it was largely a matter of extensive \nproperty holdings and carefully managed investments. Money making money. \nThere was never the need for me to learn anything of worth. I suppose in \nanother life I might have been another rich wastrel, content to squander my \ninheritance on indulgence and comfort, but I always felt a calling to make \nsomething of myself. To matter. I had no interest in politics and, while I was \ncertainly no fool, my attempts at academia were ultimately unsatisfying. \nBusiness bored me to tears. The only thing I was ever truly talented at was \nacquiring things. I suppose you could say I was skilled at shopping. \nI don’t say that to be glib, nor as a comment on my wealth. I don’t mean I \ngained any satisfaction from wasting money on vulgar Bond Street trinkets. I \nmean, I had a genuine and pronounced talent for finding items of worth and \nconvincing their owners to part with them. The most valuable things always \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG080 – The Librarian \nneed to be hunted, and that was where I excelled. It started by simply cross-\nreferencing auction catalogues with local records and slightly obscure books of \nart history, but soon I had a network of contacts and took dinner with some of \nthe most eccentric curio dealers in the world. \nIt was Desmond Lorell that first told me of the books. They were a rumour, as \nthese things always are, and he had no idea of the dangers. “Magic books” he \ncalled them. He had believed them to be coded spell books derived, of all \nthings, from the writings of Merlin! \nPoor Desmond. When he finally found one, an old leather-bound thing titled \nThe Stalwart Hunters’ Almanac, he had no idea what to do with it. I suppose, \nlooking back, his death was a very good thing for me. The extent of the \nmutilation, and how closely it correlated with the passages he had described to \nme, left little doubt as to the connection. So when I acquired the book myself I \ntook exceptional precautions. \nThe thing that surprises me most, I think, is how readily I accepted the \nexistence of the supernatural. I had occasionally made purchases before that \nthat had caused… anomalies, but nothing like those books. Yet as soon as their \nnature became apparent, I simply accepted it and began to factor it into my \ndealings with them. It was shortly afterwards I hired my first assistant. A dour \nman, by the name of Albert Stross. He barely lasted a fortnight. \nIt didn’t take me long to track down other books like Lorell’s, and it seemed \nlike almost overnight I had found my purpose. I was to be the keeper of evil \ntomes. To begin with, I never gave much thought to their origins; I simply \nconcerned myself with acquiring them, and making sure I had staff I could \nspare to study them. It was easier than I expected, and I’m always surprised", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 2, "chunk_count": 9, "chars": 4207}}
