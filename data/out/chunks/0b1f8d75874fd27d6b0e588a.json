When my father passed away in 1996, I took over his \ncontracting business and have been working steadily ever since. \nI can do most anything I’m called on for but generally specialise in new builds, \nplumbing and wiring work specifically, and I’ve got something of a reputation \nfor being available at short notice, so it’s not unusual for me to be called in \npart-way through a build to do some work. When I got the job working on a \nhouse down Hill Top Road in mid-November, nothing about the situation \nseemed strange to me. The guy they had doing the wiring had been called for \njury duty and they’d lost him for a couple of weeks, so they asked me to step \nin. I was on another job during the day, but my fiancée Sam was at a \nconference in Hamburg for a while and we were saving up for the wedding, so I \nfigured I could do it in the evenings. \nNow, Hill Top Road is quite a secluded street around the Cowley area. There \naren’t many student houses on it, so it’s actually quite a peaceful place, \nespecially after all the kids living there have gone to bed. The house itself had \nonly recently been started, as some dispute over ownership had kept the land \nlocked for years, and when I turned up it was still mostly empty. It had two \nfloors with a loft that was going to be another bedroom, to match the rest of \nthe road. The doors had been fitted, although the locks had not, but the empty \nspaces where the windows were due to be still stood vacant, letting in the chill. \nThat side of the road backed on to South Park with fences marking the bottom \nof each garden. The garden of this particular house was mostly full of building \nmaterials and debris, but I remember that standing over it all was a tree. It was \nvery large and very dead and not to put too fine a point on it, the thing \ncreeped me right the hell out. It seemed to cast odd shadows, which were dark", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 0, "chunk_count": 9, "chars": 2876}}
