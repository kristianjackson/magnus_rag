I need to know. \nARCHIVIST \nI thought you hated listen— \nAre you... sure that's what you want? \nMARTIN \n(Unhappy) Of course it's not. But I need to hear it. \nARCHIVIST \nOkay. \n[Hissing static starts] \nARCHIVIST \nSee Jack. See Jack run. Run, Jack. Run into the dark. \n[Hissing static ends] \n[Night birds, rusty squeaks, and screams continue] \nARCHIVIST \nDon't see Jack anymore. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 173 – Night Night \n14 \nJack doesn't want to be in the dark. Everyone knows there are monsters in the \ndark. Horrible monsters, with sharp teeth and red eyes and big nasty claws, \nthat eat up little children who don't run fast enough. \nSo why does Jack run into the dark? Is it because a grown-up told him to? No. \nNow that it's dark, the grown-ups are asleep. They are snoring in their beds \nand will not wake up no matter how much Jack shouts. \nSome grown-ups are not in bed, but they do not want to help Jack. They want \nto be alone. They don't want any children around at all. They tell Jack it is after \nhis bedtime, and put him in another dark room where he cannot run. \nSo no grown-ups told Jack to run into the dark. \nIs it because he is brave enough to fight the monsters? No. Jack is scared all the \ntime. The world is so big and the night is so long, and the monsters are waiting \nunder the bed and in the closet and down the hallway and in the street and \nround the corner and behind him. \nThey cannot wait to eat him. \nHe wants to be somewhere the monsters can't get him. \nJack is not brave. So why does Jack run into the dark? \nBecause everywhere is dark on Night Street. And if he doesn't run, the \nmonsters will get him. \nJack has never seen a monster — of course he hasn't; it's too dark — but he is \nsure that they are there. See that shadow, behind the swings? It is twisty and \ntwirly, and if he doesn't jump over it, then Jack is sure it would cut off his feet \nand eat them. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 173 – Night Night \n15 \nSee that tree, the one in the back garden? If Jack got too close, he is sure the \nbark will open like a big mouth and splinter teeth will bite off his hands to wear \nlike apples. \nYou see that drum, the one from the old drying machine? There's a big worm \nthat lives underneath it, and Jack is sure that if he disturbs it, it will wrap \naround him like a big slimy snake and squeeze him until his eyes pop out. \nSo Jack keeps running. He keeps running through the dark. He runs through his \nbig, dark house. He runs through his big, dark garden. He runs down the big, \ndark street that just goes round and round and round. \nHe runs until he sees another child. It's Callum, from number 27. He is big and \nbrave and isn't scared of monsters, though he knows ever so much about \nthem. He smiles when he sees Jack. He is Jack's friend. For just a minute, Jack \nstops running. Callum smiles and says he's found a brand new monster. \nJack doesn't want to hear about it. He knows that when Callum tells him what \nit is, then it will start to chase him. He won't see it, of course, because its just \ntoo dark. But he will know it's there. \nJack can't tell Callum to be quiet, though. Last time he did that, Callum put him \nin a hole for a very long time, and the next hole would certainly be full of all of \nCallum's nastiest monsters. And anyway, Callum is Jack's friend. And friends \ndon't tell each other to be quiet. \nSo Callum begins to tell Jack about a new monster. It lives down the drain and \npops up through the plughole when you're washing your hands and bites off all \nyour fingers one by one. The only way to stop it is to shine a torch down the \nhole.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 2, "chunk_count": 5, "chars": 3933}}
