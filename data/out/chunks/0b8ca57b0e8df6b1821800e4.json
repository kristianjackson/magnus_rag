Audio recording by Jonathan Sims, Head Archivist of the Magnus \nInstitute, London. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 063 – The End of the Tunnel \n \n2 \n \nStatement begins. \nARCHIVIST (STATEMENT) \nI’m sure you know what urban exploring is. I’m sure you’ve had plenty of \namateur yahoos in here who stumble across a ghost in some old factory, so I’ll \nspare you the breakdown of how it works. And if you don’t know what it is, \nwell, the internet’s a thing. Look it up. I’m about as close to a professional as \nyou can get out of what’s basically trespass as a sport. I work as a \nphotographer and, if I play my cards right, I can get more money from an \nabandoned pump station than from shooting some spoiled human Barbie for \n‘Self Hate Monthly’ or whatever. It’s always been me and Luke Nelson. He was \nmy wife’s brother and did all the lighting for our shoots. At least until he was \neaten by the darkness last week. That’s why I’m here. Because I didn’t dream \nthat. It happened. I don’t care what Steph says. I don’t need to talk to a shrink. \nI need to talk to you. \nWe were underneath St Paul’s Church in West Hackney – horrid, boxy building, \nreally makes you wonder about God’s housing standards. I mean, I’m just \nsaying if it was my house, I’d be pretty pissed. Still, I guess if He didn’t want it, \nHe should have protected its predecessor from Nazi bombs. Because St Paul’s \nused to be St James’ before it got blitzed all the way to rubble. Everyone \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 063 – The End of the Tunnel \n \n3 \n \nalways forgets how much London is under London. I mean, it’s not as bad as \nsomewhere like Edinburgh, where they literally buried half the city and built a \nnew one on top, but in some places it’s not too far from it. And I’d been doing \na lot of research into St Paul’s-that-used-to-be-St James’, because it looked like \nit might be exactly one such place. \nPlans of the drainage and underground of the neighbourhood seemed to \nindicate that there was a large subterranean area directly beneath St Paul’s \nthat appeared to be avoided by all public works, yet the plans for the modern \nchurch didn’t indicate anything below ground level. What this told me was that \nthe old church of St James probably had quite a sizeable under-presence which \nhadn’t been completely destroyed by the bombs and which its inheritor didn’t \nuse. Early to mid-19th century Victorian vaults, undisturbed for 70 years? It \nwas exactly the sort of thing that’s in vogue at the moment with a certain \nsection of arty magazines, and I was sure I could sell a few to Getty and a \nhandful of other stock photo sites. And hey, it wasn’t like I hadn’t broken into a \nchurch before. \nLuckily, St Paul’s, West Hackney was Church of England, meaning they didn’t \nlock up as tight as some places. Catholic churches can be a real pain as they \nactually have some valuables inside that need to be protected, but this, like \nmost C of E, was plain and unadorned inside.
