I \nmade my way over to them, though by the time I reached that part of the \ncarriage I was having to bend down to avoid parts of the ceiling. It appeared to \nbe a man, probably late fifties, early sixties, with a scraggly grey beard and \nwhat had once been a nice jacket. He had sunken blue eyes, and the seat \naround him had twisted so much it was now holding him in place at an angle \nthat looked very painful. The armrests were digging hard into the flesh of his \nleg, and his back was crooked. Despite this, he seemed to be breathing. \nWhen he didn’t respond to my voice, I touched him lightly on the shoulder. His \neyes opened slowly, and locked on mine. The look on his face was one of \nincredible sadness, as though all the fear had been sucked out of him and now \n\nall that was left was some unspeakable misery. I asked him if I could help, \nwhether we could get out there, but he just shook his head, his neck making \nhorrid cracking noises as he did so. I felt his hand close around my wrist, \ngripping it with an unexpected strength. I tried to push him away but his \nfingernails dug into my skin, drawing blood. A ragged voice hissed out of him, \ndespairing and full of pain. He said to me, “Not enough space to move. Never \nenough to breathe.” \nThen he let me go. \nBy then the ceiling was almost on top of me and the walls looked like they \nwere close to giving way. I thought about what options I had and, after a few \nseconds, I lay down on the floor and closed my eyes. \nBeing crushed to death would be horrible, yes, but I have never been afraid of \ndying, and it didn’t appear that there would be any point to further escape \nattempts. Better to accept my fate and hope it was all some awful dream. I \nkept my eyes shut and tried to relax, as the sound of twisting metal filled my \nears and I could feel the floor begin to shift beneath me. It bent up, either side, \nand slowly began to press inwards. Far away, under the smothering blanket of \nearth, I could hear the old man screaming. \nWhen I awoke, I was on the platform at Walthamstow Central, with one of the \nstation assistants leaning over me, trying to see if I was alright. I was feeling \nvery groggy and I didn’t want to be answering questions, so I played drunk, \nignored his offers to help and stumbled out into the cold night air. There were \na few blissful minutes where I thought it had all just been a dream, but then I \nnoticed that I was covered head to toe in mud and dirt. And my wrist ached \nwhere five deep red marks made the shape of a clutching hand. \n\nThat’s it. \nARCHIVIST \nWell, that certainly sounds like an... unpleasant experience. I’m not sure I \nunderstand, though. Did you fall asleep, somehow, or... \nKAROLINA \nI must have done. \nARCHIVIST \nThat’s... that’s impressive. Do you still take the Tube? \nKAROLINA \nOf course. I live in London. \nARCHIVIST \nRight. I, uh... \nKAROLINA \nIs there anything else? I’ve told you what happened, so I’m done here, correct? \nARCHIVIST \nI suppose so, yes. We’ll look into it, and if we find anything we’ll let you know. \nKAROLINA \nDon't bother. I'm done with it. Thank you for your time. \n \n \n[Tape clicks off] \nARCHIVIST", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 3, "chunk_count": 5, "chars": 3193}}
