But on \nour arrival at the camp, Raleigh dismissed them, and started to move all of our \nsupplies onto only a few of the animals. He told us we would have to be quick \nif we were to find what we sought, and we couldn’t do that with a trail of \nanimals behind us. He used that word a lot: quick. I tried to explain to him that \na methodical search would be more effective, but he just continued to mutter \nit. Eventually I relented. Much as I was growing to dislike Raleigh as a person, \nhe raised several good points about our chances of avoiding any sort of \nconfrontation with the Xavante, and Jack was quick to voice his support. So it \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 133 – Dead Horse \n \n5 \n \nwas that at the death of May, myself, Jack and Raleigh set out deeper into the \njungle. Alone. \nThat night the mosquitoes were out in force, thick with fever and hungry for \nour blood. I did my best to simply ignore them, safe as I was within my net. But \nover in Raleigh’s tent I kept hearing a sporadic thumping or clapping sound, as \nif he were killing them with his bare hands. When I asked him about it the next \nday, he simply told me he had inside him a strong and enduring hatred of \nbloodsuckers. Jack nodded, as though the statement were in some way \nprofound, and I didn’t know what to say to it. \nThat was the day we found the stone. Half-buried, worn almost completely \nsmooth by time and exposure, but still clearly covered in those same \nhieroglyphics as I had seen in Da Silva’s manuscript. I was overjoyed, almost to \nthe point of weeping. I had been right. Jack clapped me on the back and \nstarted making some sketches of the symbols. Raleigh was silent, staring at our \ndiscovery with a look I’d never seen before. He didn’t blink for almost two \nminutes. Then, he gradually, painstakingly lowered his head, until his face was \nright next to the rough stone surface. He took several long breaths, as though \nsniffing the thing, and then I thought I saw his tongue shoot out, just for a \nmoment, and taste the air around it. \nWithout a word, he took off into the jungle at a dead run. Myself and Jack, \nstartled for a moment, quickly followed. Raleigh was quick, but the uneven \njungle floor and terrain made moving difficult, so we were able to keep him in \nsight until he stopped short. I caught up to him, breathless from exhaustion, \nand asked him what in God’s name he thought he was doing. \n“We’re close,” he said. “I can smell it. I won’t let it get away again.” \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 133 – Dead Horse \n \n6 \n \nI told him I didn’t understand, that we were looking for a ruined city, that it \ncouldn’t “get away”. But Raleigh just repeated himself, “I can smell it,” and to \nmy dismay I could see Jack nodding along. \nThis was where things started to turn, and my memory begins to fragment. I \nkept a journal, but the entries were sporadic and shaky. The dates no longer \nmake sense. At some point, I realised that there were no animals around us \nanymore, that the Amazon had become strangely quiet, but I don’t know \nwhether this was before or after I found the pile of dead birds in Raleigh’s tent. \nIt must have been before, but my journal is not clear on the matter. \nWhat I do know is that we kept going deeper and deeper into the jungle. Jack \nhad taken over the compass and sextant by that point, and I had little idea \nwhere we were actually going. Raleigh no longer slept, of this I was sure, and \nthe inconvenience of setting up camp was clearly starting to grate on him. I no \nlonger had any fear of meeting the Xavante, as I somehow knew that wherever \nwe were, it was no longer in territory they would want to claim. There were \nother animals now. I could never get more than a glimpse, but they were not \nthe birds, or the mule, or any of Raleigh's other victims. They were far too \nsharp for that. And they were definitely following us. \nWhen we met the second expedition, it seemed like I was the only one \nsurprised. There were almost a dozen of them, fitted with cold weather outfits \nand icebreaking equipment, and they seemed to take no heed of the thick, \nhumid heat of the jungle. They greeted us like old friends, and Raleigh began to \nask them what they had found, how their search was going, how many had \nmade it. I tried to say a few words, but by this point I was so disorientated, so \nout of step with whatever path the expedition was treading, that even if they \ncould hear me it was clear they", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 2, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 4498}}
