I started to ask him about his health and explained why I \nwas there, but he showed not the slightest sign that he was listening. \n“I had them rebound last year,” he said. “Damp can do terrible things to a \nbook.” \nI told him I was certain that was the case, but I must insist we talk about his \nhealth. Again, he ignored me. Instead, he took the seat opposite me and \nstarted to tell me a story. And then another. And another. A stream of strange \ntales began to pour out of him, and I just sat there, transfixed, desperately \nwishing I had the strength of will to stand and leave, but all I could do was \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 127 – Remains to be Seen \n \n6 \n \nlisten. He told me of a seamstress who laced her body with fine black thread, \nand when she pulled it all out in a single swift motion, her skin dropped away \nlike a loose shift. He told me of a man so scared to die he spent a year weaving \na rope blindfolded, so that he would not know the length and could not \nforesee the moment it would tighten around his neck when he finally threw \nhimself into the void. He told me of a fire that burns so hot and fierce that to \neven know about it is enough to burn a man’s tongue from his head. He told \nme so many terrible things. \nAnd at the end of it all, the only thing I could think to ask him was where he \nread them. My eyes darted to the books that surrounded us, but Albrecht \nlaughed at this and placed his hands across a spine that was simply labelled, A \nWarning. For a moment, he looked as though he were about to wrench it from \nits place and hurl it into the fire, but it passed. He turned back to me. \n“You do not understand,” he said to me in German, “I do not read the books. \nThey read me.” \nI did not ask him to clarify further. I got the key to my room from Greta and \nmade sure this time that the door was locked as I slept. \nAs my stay progressed, I learned more of his condition. I would have initially \ndescribed it as a natural mania that had found a totemic focus on the books of \nhis library, but when he finally told me the story of how he discovered them, \nand the awful tomb from which they were retrieved, I began to suspect that \nperhaps the books had brought some contaminant into Albrecht's home which \nhad gradually corroded his mind. I had neither the time nor equipment to \nconduct the sort of tests that might have confirmed such things, but I became \nconvinced that removing the books would go some way to addressing his \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 127 – Remains to be Seen \n \n7 \n \nhealth concerns. I expected some stiff resistance on the subject, but Albrecht’s \nresponse seemed closer to relief than any sort of distress. He simply asked if I \nwould help and, to my eternal regret, I agreed. \nWhat shall I tell you, Jonah, about this fool's errand, that damnable journey we \nembarked upon? Shall I regale you with the awful experiences of transporting \na library’s worth of books through the Black Forest? Perhaps I should write you \nan in-depth account of finding that ancient cemetery, of descending into that \nbleak and frozen mausoleum? Or would you prefer to hear about the hours we \nspent placing volume after volume on empty, grey shelves, ignoring how out of \nplace the new bindings appeared against the antique stonework? \nNo. I’m sure all you want to know was how Albrecht died. Why it was that, as I \nreplaced the last book taken from that place, I heard his scream from the top \nof the stairs and ran up to find him sprawled and dead before the stone coffin. \nBut I cannot answer that. I do not know how he died. I saw nothing and no-one \nwith him, and his body seemed whole and undamaged. But I do have some \nidea as to why it happened. For as I filled those dead shelves with freshly \nbound volumes, I could not help but notice that every page was blank. I have \nsince checked with Payne’s, who I believe to be your preferred bookbinders, \nand I know that the books poor Albrecht was returning to the grave were not \nthe books that were taken. I hope they bring you much wisdom, Jonah, for the \ncost was dear enough. \nNothing stood in the way of my retreat, and I dragged Albrecht’s body back as \nfar as the coach. We left that awful place and I have endeavoured most acutely \nto forget the route.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 2, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 4348}}
