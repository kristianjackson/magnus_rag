The Magnus Archives.

Perhaps you would not see it from a distance, \nand the faint sting of rot on the breeze is easy enough to dismiss. But as you \nget closer that infectious feeling of wrongness is harder and harder to shake. \nThe grass is not the green of nature, the buildings are warped by more than \nage, and the voices that come from behind the inhabitants’ masks are hoarse \nand wet. They move with exaggerated casualness, a parody of idyllic village \nlife. And when they have a break from weeping, they reassure each other how \nwonderful it is in their village, or at least how wonderful it used to be. Each is \ncovered from head to toe in thick black fabric, and they never, ever touch. \nTake a deep breath. The air feels thick and soupy in your lungs, swarming with \na thousand contagions digging into you, begging for you to join the village. It’s \nso quiet there, and everyone cares for each other, far from the din and \ncompacted flesh of the city. In the centre, a maypole stands, mildewed strips \nof coloured cloth hanging limply from it like shreds of ragged skin. The base of \nthe pole is ashen and charred. \n[The background park sounds slowly fades further into the \nbackground; the sound of buzzing of insects and squirming worms \nfades in] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nThe disease itself is nothing special. It begins as a small patch of discoloured \nskin, the tiniest blemish. Scrub it off, and it is gone! For a few hours, at least. \nBut it returns again and again, and begins to spread, a mould with tendrils that \nburrow deep. It ranges in colour from rancid yellow and corpse-fat white to the \ndull, angry purple of a fresh bruise. It itches, and burns, and you can feel it \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 164 – The Sick Village \n3 \ngrowing and spreading inside you, looking for the core of you. At least until it \nworms its way into your bones. Beneath the coat of each terrified citizen of \nthis sick village lies a lurking possibility, a nightmarish suspicion of infectious \nconstellations of hungry mildew, a mutating technicolour atlas of rotten and \npockmarked flesh. But who can know for sure? Their coats are oh, so thick. \nThere was never a time before the disease, no matter what the old bastards \ntell you. It has always been in the village, always festered in the dark corners \nwhere nobody could stomach to check. Where good neighbours wouldn’t \ndream to speculate. But those who live here will tell you different. From \nbehind their masks those friendly voices will tell you how it used to be: clean, \nand hygienic, and always bathed in sepia sunshine. They know in the guts of \nthem this sickness has come from outside, that it is those from beyond the \nvillage that have done this to them. \nThey brought it here, they whisper to each other in the unnamed pub, hunched \nand bloated over their pale and stinking beers, lifting their masks to take a \nmouthful, puce faces and frightened sneers exposed for just a moment. \nThey couldn’t leave us well enough alone. They wanted what we have, our \nperfect peaceful life, and so they dragged their sickness here and damned us \nall. The patrons speak quietly, as who can say for certain whether the face \nbehind a mask is a good, honest village face, or a sickness-bearing harbinger \nfrom beyond. \nAnd people do still come to the village, for however thick the paranoia, \nhowever terrible the disease, there are worse things beyond. They are \nstopped, of course. Beaten and stripped and checked head to toe for signs of \ninfection. The village council sees to that. Most are uncontaminated, though \nthat does little to save them, while others are already laced right through with", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 0, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 4350}}
