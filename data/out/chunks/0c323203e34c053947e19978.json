He ignored the first question \ncompletely and said, in English, that what he wanted was to have a nice \nholiday in peace. He said it in a really accusatory way, like I was ruining his \nholiday somehow, and I said so. He sighed and said that he wasn’t in the \nbusiness of “helping strays”. \n \nNow I didn’t know what help he was offering and I certainly didn’t ask for it, so \nI got up to leave. He apologised grudgingly and said that, as he was here, he \nfelt he should at least let me know that I was “marked”. He didn’t know what \nby, but that it was close. Was I married? Did I have a fiancé? Partner? Friends? \nI told him no, not really, and was just about sick of his stupid questions, but he \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG048 – Lost in The Crowd \n7 \n \nsounded oddly desperate. Siblings? No. Mother? Of course I had a mother. \nWere we close? Did I love her? I gave him a look and he again asked if we were \nclose. I said yes, we were very close, and then I got up to leave. As I left, I heard \nhim call him after me, telling me to remember my mother, to keep her face in \nmy mind. I didn’t reply. \n \nEthan didn’t return to the hostel that night. At first, I assumed he was simply \nout drinking late, but as evening turned into night and as night turned into \nmorning, I started to get a little worried. It was none of my business, of course, \nbut Genoa wasn’t an all-night party sort of town. I would have assumed he’d \nmaybe just headed on without me, but his backpack was still in our room, \nuntouched. I wanted to dismiss it as paranoia, but my encounter with the \nweirdo in the cafe had left me a bit rattled. When the sun came up on the third \nday in Genoa without any sign of Ethan, I decided to go out and look for him. \n \nMy first move was to try and locate that street market he’d mentioned. \nPerhaps it wasn’t just hidden away; perhaps it had been actually illegal and \nhe’d got caught up in something he shouldn’t have. He had given me a good \nidea of the rough area in Genoa it had been, so I started my search there. I \nfound nothing. Asking around just yielded a barrage of confused Italian from \npassers-by who I couldn’t talk to. So I just kept walking. Morning turned into \nafternoon and the previously sunny day became overcast and oppressive. I \nwould occasionally half-heartedly shout out Ethan’s name, though I don’t know \nwhat I was expecting. At first, this got me annoyed shouts from nearby \nwindows, then glares and eventually they got no response at all. The streets I \nwas walking were narrower and narrower and the houses and buildings next to \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG048 – Lost in The Crowd \n8 \n \nme seemed to get taller with each turning I made, their previously vibrant \ncolours muted under the cloudy sky. The afternoon was completely silent. \n \nI began to think. How long had it been since I saw another person? Twenty \nminutes? An hour? Two hours? I hadn’t checked my watch and my mind was \nfoggy. It was hard to think in all the humidity. I went to take a drink from my \nwater bottle to find it empty. Had I finished it? I couldn’t have been searching \nthat long. Then I heard it from up ahead, the dull murmuring of a crowd of \npeople, that rolling babble of incomprehensible noise that only comes from \ndozens of voices talking at once. Relief washed over me and I headed towards \nthe noise. \n \nThe street I was heading towards was wider than those that I had just been \nwalking and seemed better lit somehow. Best of all, I could see a constant flow \nof people travelling down it in both directions. Perhaps this was the street \nmarket Ethan had mentioned? I stumbled out into it and began to look around. \nI couldn’t see any stalls, or shops, or anything that might explain the presence \nof so many people, but I didn’t have time to really think about it before they \nstarted bumping into me. It didn’t seem deliberate, but there were so many \npeople, far more than I had thought at first, and they couldn’t move without \njostling or pushing me. \n \nThe flow of people dragged me this way and that. I was surrounded that by \nthat noise, that mumbling noise of the crowd.
