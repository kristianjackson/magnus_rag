It was her first, \nshe always told me, and would probably be her last. \nI never knew my dad. Not really. He worked in the Archives like you, but quit \nonce I was born. I think he wanted to help raise me. But mum didn’t need the \nhelp, and after me she wasn’t able to have kids again, so she killed him in his \nsleep to practice her bookbinding. I guess she failed. I always thought he was in \nhere, but when I eventually got hold of it, there wasn’t a page in there. \nShe did her best to look after me, and bring me into this world she inhabited, \nbut she wasn’t a caring mother or a skilled teacher. My struggling at her \nlessons infuriated her. I mean, looking back now I can see that her knowledge \nwas basic at best. But I was a kid. I could only try to avoid her temper, and \nlearn my weird lessons, writing out nonsense, and pretending I understood \nparadoxes that most adults couldn’t handle. \nWe travelled a lot. Between her day job as a rare bookseller and her… \nvocation, it wasn’t often we stayed in London for more than a month. We met \nwith things that almost made me throw up I was so afraid, and she’d talk to \n\nthem like old friends. It was awful, but I suppose in many ways, it worked. \nWhenever I tried to run away the ‘real’ world seemed so… ignorant I could \nnever be a part of it. So I did my best to find my place within the world of my \nmum. As an idiot teenager I hunted Leitner’s books with the best of them, \neven found a few. I’d bring them home, and watch her eyes light up. But it was \nalways the books that she was happy to see. Eventually, I grew old enough and \nwise enough to see her obsession for what it really was: hubris. She lived her \njust carefully enough not to be destroyed by things she studied, but that was it. \nThe things out there weren’t like taming fire, they couldn’t be contained or \nused for light or warmth. The best you could hope for from them, would be \nthat they don’t spot you, and instead my mum chased after them, obsessed \nwith others who had tried to stare at them without being blinded: y’know, \nFlamsteed, Smirke, Leitner. Idiots who destroyed themselves chasing a secret \nthat wasn’t worth knowing. And the worst thing was, she marked me as a part \nof that, without my understanding. Or consent. \nOur relationship, such as it was, it quickly went downhill. But I never managed \nto leave. I just couldn’t bring myself to finally cut that cord and abandon her, \nno matter what she said. And I think she knew that. I think she knew she had \nme trapped. But it was a hollow victory. She also knew that I wouldn’t continue \nher work, that whatever destiny she had tried to write for the Von Closen line, \ndied with her. I think that might have been what finally pushed her to do it. To \ntry and take full control of the book. I remember the smell when I came back \nto the shop that day, the heavy blood smell. She had just finished writing on \nthe third sheet she’d hung on that old fishing wire, laced between the shelves, \nand she was on the edge of passing out. She wouldn’t stop, though. She \nwouldn’t give in. She thrust a razor blade and a marker pen at me, and begged \nme to help her finish. \nEverything was red, every possible shade of dark, and wet, and drying crimson. \nI turned to run but I slipped, fell to the floor and I crawled, panicking, down \ninto the street. I managed to stagger to a coffee shop across the road, and I \njust sat there in shock until the police arrived. \nBetween the blood on my clothes, eyewitnesses who saw me leaving, and the \nfact the mutilations were so awful the judge said it was “inconceivable to \nsuggest they were self-inflicted”, it seemed like an open and shut case.
