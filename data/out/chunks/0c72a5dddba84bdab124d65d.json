When a new Power can \nbirth itself screaming from the torn remnants of others? I know you say the \nFlesh was perhaps always there, shrivelled and nascent until it’s recent growth, \nbut to grant the existence of such lesser powers would throw everything into \nconfusion. Would you have me separate the corruption between insects, dirt \nand disease? To divide the fungal bloom from the maggot? No. No, I stand by \nmy work. And thus we must conclude that the only explanation is a new \npower, created from what was once others, yet also distinct. And if such \nchange is possible, how then can any true balance be achieved through \nimmutable, unchanging stone? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 138 – The Architecture of Fear \n \n9 \n \nI have been dreaming again, Jonah. The same every night for months now. I \nimagine myself a boy again at Aspley. I awake, cold and alone, in the \ndormitory. The sky outside is dark and I see no stars. I light a candle to better \nsee my way and step down the silent corridor. The masters’ rooms are empty, \nthe fire in the kitchen is dead. Eventually my steps lead out into the courtyard. \nIt is so quiet that the sound of my feet upon the grass is painful to my ears. I \nstop and look up at the sky, that empty black nothing and I see the edges of \nthe horizon becoming a dull white. I cannot understand what I am looking at. \nAnd then the sky blinks. And I awake. \nI am not a fool. I know well enough what this dream is likely to mean, and I \nwarn you again that if you have any remaining ambitions to use our work to try \nand wear the Watcher’s Crown, you must abandon them, not simply for the \nsake of your own soul but for that of the world. I have always had the utmost \nrespect for you as a man of dignity and learning. Do not allow yourself to fall to \nthis madness. \nI have been thinking, of late, about the first origin of the Dread Powers, if such \nbeings can really be said to have true origins. Are they eternal? Or were they \ncreated from our own fear by some grand accident or, worse, some grand \ndesign. I believe the latter to be the case, as you well know, for I have in vain \nstruggled to reconcile their creation with the existence of a loving God. They \nare not demons, of this I am sure, though we have drawn parallels with their \nacolytes and certain monstrous figures from ancient myth. No, I feel certain \nthey were brought into existence by some ancient civilisation, some foolish \ntribe from pre-history. \nDo you know of Alexander Cunningham? He’s been working with the Viceroy \nof India on the Indus Valley digs and has discovered some quite remarkable \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 138 – The Architecture of Fear \n \n10 \n \nthings. Burial pits full of burned bones and ash, skulls with markings as though \nthe eyes were removed and others that seem buried alive. Perhaps a dying \ncivilisation sought to harness its own terror, as we once thought to harness its \nresults. Of course, such things are pure conjecture. I have not brought \nCunningham into my confidence on this, nor do I believe there will be any \ncause to. Even if there was still time remaining to me. \nPerhaps you wonder why I am so convinced of my imminent demise, and why I \nshould see it as a cause to reach out to you, after so much silence and distrust \nhas passed between us? Certainly you must either wonder or you already \nknow all too well. I have been watched for some time now, since shortly \nbefore the dreams began. It was subtle at first, easy to ignore and dismiss. \nWhat possible harm could there be in the idle glance of a footman, staring at \nyou as you leave your home? And no doubt the shopkeeper is permitted to \nwatch whomsoever he pleases within the confines of his own establishment? \nSo I have been reassuring myself as I attempted to ignore my own growing \ndisquiet. \nBut what is not to be dismissed is when your driver, on the long road from \nLondon, takes his eyes from the horses and begins to turn his head. Slowly at \nfirst, but with a clear determination, inch by inch without ceasing, neck \ncracking and skin stretching, until his whole head seems as though it were \nplaced atop his shoulders in reverse by some careless sculptor. The others in \nmy carriage seemed not to mark this awful sight, but I could scarce look away, \nand the eyes of this twisted figure were locked on my own, tears streaming \nfrom their corners.
