I didn’t have any other plans, so I said, ‘Sure’. And you \nknow what? He was right. It was beautiful: the colourful houses climbing up \nthe steep streets from the coast and the paths beside the sea. That first day we \nstepped off the train, I fell a little bit in love with Genoa. \n \nWe checked into a hostel and, for once, decided to get a private room, and \ndropped our backpacks from tired shoulders. We didn’t need to say anything \nto know we’d be exploring the city on our own. Ethan would be re-visiting \ncherished memories and I would be discovering new ones, but neither of us \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG048 – Lost in The Crowd \n5 \n \nwanted to do so in company. Most of our time together was spent at night: \ndining, talking or otherwise engaged. \n \nThe first morning, I went for a long walk along the coast. The sea air was \ninvigorating and when the salt-tinged air sent cool fingers running through my \nhair, I felt so alive I nearly wept. I put all thoughts of returning to my dull, \nEnglish life from my mind and relished my freedom. There were a few others \nwalking near me, but Italian is one of the few languages I have never managed \nto pick up even a small amount of, so their conversation was alien to me and \ndid not intrude on my precious isolation. \n \nAs Ethan and I talked that night, I tried to put it into words, but without any \nreal success. Even here, with the time to compose it properly, I’m still not sure \nI’ve caught the essence of what I felt. Ethan, for his part, had told me of his \nexplorations of the backstreets of Genoa. He had found himself in a small \nsection of town that seemed older than the rest, he said, and unlike the rest of \nit, it was bustling. He suspected there might have been an out of the way \nstreet market there and was hoping to find it again tomorrow. Then we went \nto bed and I got what may have been my last restful night. \n \nThe next day, I decided to find a nice, local cafe and spend some time reading. \nIt wasn’t difficult to do, as if there’s one thing it’s easy to find in Italy, it’s \ncoffee. This one was well hidden and warmer than outside, even though the \nday was very hot for the time of year. I took a seat and ordered a coffee. I tried \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG048 – Lost in The Crowd \n6 \n \nto read, but it was so warm that even with the strong coffee in my hand, I \nfound it hard to keep my eyes open and kept nodding off. \n \nIt was after one such accidental nap that I saw him. He was pale, scrawny \nalmost and looked utterly out of place. His loose, bright shirt was in stark \ncontrast to his long black hair and he was staring at me in a way I found quite \nuncomfortable. I mean, I know I’m not unattractive and I’m used to creepy \nguys staring at me sometimes, but this was different. He was staring at me \nwith an air of concentration, like he was trying to read something written very \nsmall on my forehead. After about a minute of this, he got up and walked over \nto me. \n \nHe took the seat opposite and sat down. He was still staring at me and it \nbecame clear that I was going to have to start the conversation, so I asked him \nwho the hell he was and what the hell he wanted. He ignored the first question \ncompletely and said, in English, that what he wanted was to have a nice \nholiday in peace. He said it in a really accusatory way, like I was ruining his \nholiday somehow, and I said so. He sighed and said that he wasn’t in the \nbusiness of “helping strays”. \n \nNow I didn’t know what help he was offering and I certainly didn’t ask for it, so \nI got up to leave. He apologised grudgingly and said that, as he was here, he \nfelt he should at least let me know that I was “marked”. He didn’t know what \nby, but that it was close. Was I married? Did I have a fiancé? Partner? Friends? \nI told him no, not really, and was just about sick of his stupid questions, but he", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 2, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 3977}}
