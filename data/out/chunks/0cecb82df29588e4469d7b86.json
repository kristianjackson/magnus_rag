I don’t know. Something about the way you two seemed to connect \nwhen she came in. \nARCHIVIST \nBefore she was eaten by a door. \nMARTIN \nWell, Yeah. It certainly seemed to have a pretty deep impact on you. \nARCHIVIST \nIt did. I think... I mean, you remember how I was back then, how paranoid. The \nNot!Sasha was there, and I could sense something wasn’t right, but I just \ncouldn’t place it. Left me a suspicious wreck. Then when Helen Richardson \ncame in, it seemed like… she was in the same place I was, but worse, further \nalong. I thought, maybe if I could help her, that would mean... maybe I wasn’t \nbeyond help? \n(Beat) \nMARTIN \nI’m sorry for how it worked out. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 188 – Centre of Attention \n \n7 \nARCHIVIST \nMe too. \nMARTIN \nWas there any of the original Helen left in there? \n(The Archivist exhales with uncertainty) \nARCHIVIST \nI… If there was I could never see it properly. I know that Helen Richardson was \ngone. The same way Michael Shelley was gone. I know The Distortion was \nneither of them. I also know that The Distortion of Helen was not the same \nbeing as The Distortion of Michael. But they were all so twisted up as a direct \npart of The Spiral. It…It’s like, I could follow the knowledge of any one line of \nidentity, but as soon as I tried to take a step back and see the whole, the \npicture… changed. \nI want to believe that thing was just wearing Helen Richardson like a mask. \nThat I finally avenged her. \n(Beat) \nMARTIN \n…A-At least we’ll have plenty to tell the others when we meet up. \nARCHIVIST \nYeah. Yeah we will. \nMARTIN \nSpeaking of. How’s Basira doing? Where is she, at the moment? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 188 – Centre of Attention \n \n8 \n[Hissing static starts] \nARCHIVIST \nShe’s trying to catch her breath in a labyrinth of masks. She hates The Stranger, \nbut has overcome it before, and will do so again. Her path is slow and painful, \nbut she hasn’t fallen yet. \n[Hissing static ends] \nMARTIN \nThanks. I’m, I’m trying not to worry about her. \nARCHIVIST \nI know. \n(Beat) \n[Footsteps continue] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nOh. Hold on. \nMARTIN \nWhat? \n[They stop walking] \nARCHIVIST \nWe’re about to enter London proper. We should take a moment. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 188 – Centre of Attention \n \n9 \nMARTIN \nWhat’s it like? \nARCHIVIST \nIt’s the seat of The Eye. The other powers have small enclaves within in, but... \nit’s going to be a lot. \nMARTIN \nOkay. A lot of what? \n[They take a step forward and there is the crackling static of \ndomain transition] \n[Sounds of surburbia is replaced with the whirr of irises focussing, \nsecurity cameras whirring and the buzz of drones flying past] \nMARTIN (CONT’D) \nOookay. That’s a lot of, um... Are they real? \nARCHIVIST \nThey’re not people. But they can see us. \nMARTIN \nD-Do they ever leave the windows, or... \nARCHIVIST \nNo. They don't need to. They have a very good view. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 188 – Centre of Attention \n \n10 \nMARTIN \nAnd the cameras? \nARCHIVIST \nI wouldn’t look at them too closely. \nMARTIN \nI won’t if they return the favour. \nOkay. S-So. D-Do we just... start walking again? \nARCHIVIST \nI don’t see why not. \n[There is a crunch of glass debris as they start walking] \nMARTIN \nAt least there aren’t any cars. \n[Spotlights flare into life with a heavy ka-chonk sound] \n(Martin makes a sound of unease) \nARCHIVIST \nI suppose they don’t get many new faces around here. \nMARTIN \nEspecially not The Archivist. Don’t forget, you’re a celebrity. \nARCHIVIST \nMaybe. Or maybe it’s Elias’ personal welcome wagon. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 188 – Centre of Attention \n \n11 \n[Several drones come closer in, tracking Martin and the Archivist] \nMARTIN \nOh. Hmm. Is that a possibility? \nARCHIVIST \nI don’t know. I still can’t see him. \nMARTIN \n…Then I guess we’ll find out. \nARCHIVIST \nLet’s move on. I don’t need to attract any more attention. \nMARTIN \nEr, yeah. \nARCHIVIST \nBesides, turns out I can feel a statement coming on, and I’d rather not do it \nwith any more of an audience than absolutely necessary. \n[Tape clicks off] \n[Tape clicks on] \n[Whispers echo indistinguishably, some camera iris movements] \n[The Archivist’s voice sounds more resonant, as if in an empty \nroom, then adopts usual statement tone]", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 1, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 4266}}
