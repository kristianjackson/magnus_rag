I can’t just push them in. \nARCHIVIST \nOh, you’ve got hands. \nHELEN \nSharp enough to pull out worms, kill a few old men – maybe stab an overeager \nArchivist – \n(The Archivist sighs.) \nHELEN \n– but my physicality is as much an illusion as everything else about me. Think of \nme as… a bear trap. Not a sword. \nBut we’re not talking about me, are we? \nARCHIVIST \nWhen does it stop? \nHELEN \n(Impatient) What? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 152 – A Gravedigger’s Envy \n18 \n \nARCHIVIST \nThe guilt. The misery. All the others I’ve met, they’ve been – cold, cruel. They’ve \nenjoyed what they do. When does the Eye (inhale) make me monstrous? \n(Helen laughs.) \nHELEN \nWhat – why would it ever do that? \nARCHIVIST \nI don’t… \nHELEN \nWhen has your guilt, or your sadness, or your handwringing ever actually stopped \nyou from doing what it wants? \nARCHIVIST \n(Stammering) I-I – I have not been taking statements – \nHELEN \nYou’ve sworn of other people’s trauma for now because you’re caught. Because \ncontinuing would endanger you. But other than that, when has your discomfort \never actually stopped you walking the path of the Beholding? \nARCHIVIST \nI… I don’t know… \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 152 – A Gravedigger’s Envy \n19 \n \nHELEN \nEven if it were capable of doing so, what possible reason would the Eye have to \nchange how you feel, when it makes no difference to your actions? \nHelen was like you, at first. She felt such guilt over taking people. Until one day \nshe realized she wasn’t going to stop doing it. So she chose to stop feeling guilty. \nARCHIVIST \nFine. I get it. My feelings mean nothing to it. \nHELEN \nMh, not true! They carry a certain flavor, a… seasoning. \nARCHIVIST \n(Sigh, bitter laugh) I see. \nHELEN \n(Chuckling) I am enjoying our time together. \nWell, you know my advice already. Cheerio, Jon. Enjoy your brooding. \n[Door closes.] \n(The Archivist makes a frustrated noise.) \n[Tape clicks off.] \n[The Magnus Archives Theme – Outro] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 152 – A Gravedigger’s Envy \n20 \n \nThe Magnus Archives is a podcast distributed by Rusty Quill and licensed under a \nCreative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Sharealike 4.0 International \nlicence. \n \nToday’s episode was written by Jonathan Sims and directed by Alexander J. \nNewall. \n \nIt featured: Jonathan Sims as The Archivist and Imogen Harris as Helen \nRichardson.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 6, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 2625}}
