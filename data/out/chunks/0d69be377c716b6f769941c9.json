But it’s been getting fainter, and now … I’ll try not \nto think about it. I don’t … don’t want to stretch my mind to try and see it, in \ncase it’s not there at all. I can’t afford to think about it. Not now. \n[The tape clicks off. The tape clicks on.] \nARCHIVIST \n(Strained) I think ... Oh God … I think I’m … I’m stuck. \n[The tape clicks off. The tape clicks on. The Archivist struggles to free himself. \nIn the distance there’s a thunderclap.] \nARCHIVIST \nWh-what? \n[Heavy rain sounds in the distance, and singing starts to pass through the \nearth] \nARCHIVIST \nOh no. No … \n[He struggles to breath as the Buried squeezes him. The Buried relaxes.] \n(The Archivist takes a breath.) \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 132 – Entombed \n \n5 \n \nARCHIVIST \nDaisy. \n[The Archivist tries to move] \nARCHIVIST \nDaisy! \n[Pause] \nDAISY \n(Muffled, distant) John! \n[The tape clicks off. The tape clicks on. The Archivist is still moving slowly \nforward.] \nARCHIVIST \nDaisy, can you reach me? \nDAISY \nI can’t … can’t see you. \nARCHIVIST \nFollow my voice. \nDAISY \nIs that— I, I can’t— \n[Daisy grabs the Archivist’s arm] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 132 – Entombed \n \n6 \n \nDAISY \nY-you’re real. You’re real. \nARCHIVIST \nYes. I’m here, Daisy. \nDAISY \nDaisy. Yeah. Daisy, that’s me. \nARCHIVIST \nAre you alright? \nDAISY \nI, I can’t move. I, I can’t … and I can’t … breathe. And— \nARCHIVIST \nOh God. \nDAISY \n—just alone. I think, I think … I hear this, sometimes, singing, when it’s wet. Or, \nor scratching, trying to get out. But I don’t … I don’t think there’s anyone there. \nIt’s just been me, until now. \nARCHIVIST \nAre you ... are you okay? \nDAISY \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 132 – Entombed \n \n7 \n \nNo. \nARCHIVIST \nSorry, obviously. Nah, I just meant … You sound okay. \nDAISY \nDo I? \nARCHIVIST \nI thought you might have been, uh, taken over. By the Hunt. \nDAISY \nWhat? \nARCHIVIST \nThe Hunt. You’re a hunter. \nDAISY \nYeah. Guess I was, but not here. \nARCHIVIST \nNo? \nDAISY \nNo. I can’t feel my blood. I could always feel it, but it can’t reach me here. \nWhere are we? \nARCHIVIST \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 132 – Entombed \n \n8 \n \nThe coffin. We’re in the coffin. It leads to, uh … It’s got a lot of names. Choke. \nThe Buried. Too-Close-I-Cannot-Breathe. \nDAISY \nYeah. That sounds right. \nARCHIVIST \nCome on, let’s get you out of here. \nDAISY \nC-can’t move. Even if I could, there’s no way out. \nARCHIVIST \nIt’s okay, I’ve, uh ... I’ve got a plan. \nDAISY \nThis like all your other plans? \nARCHIVIST \nIt’s fine, I just … I just need to find it. \nDAISY \nWhat? \nARCHIVST \n(Muttering to himself) Come on, come on, where are you? \n \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 132 – Entombed \n \n9 \n \nDAISY \nJohn? \nARCHIVIST \n(Still muttering to himself) Come on. \n(The Archivist sharply intakes breath.) \nDAISY \nJohn? \nARCHIVIST \nI know. \nDAISY \nThe way out? \nARCHIVIST \nNo. I know where we are. There is no out. Not here. This is … This is forever \ndeep below creation, where the weight of existence bears down. This is the \nBuried, and we are alive. There isn’t even an up. What have I done? What have \nI done? \nDAISY \nNot alone, though? \nARCHIVIST \nNo. No, not alone. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 132 – Entombed \n \n10 \n \n[Music begins to play softly, then fades out] \nDAISY \nJohn? \nARCHIVIST \nStill here. \nDAISY \nGood, I … Good. I want to talk. \nARCHIVIST \nOkay. Um, and what do you want to talk about? \nDAISY \nDon’t … I don’t care. I, I, I just want someone to hear me. \nARCHIVIST \nWell, I’m not going anywhere. \n(Daisy laughs shakily.) \nARCHIVIST \nDaisy? \nDAISY \nOh.
