I-I-Is that you? Uh, I, I was having the most wonderful dream... \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 200 – Last Words \n4 \nARCHIVIST \n(Icily) Get up. \nJONAH \nWhat’s—? Wh-what’s going on? Where—? \n[Jonah slowly gets up as he talks] \n[The Archivist draws a knife] \nJONAH (CONT’D) \nOh. I-I see. \nARCHIVIST \nIt’s over. \nJONAH \nIs it? (sigh) \nYes. Yes, I suppose it must be. \n(Tired exhalation) \nWhere’s Martin? I rather thought he’d be the one to do the deed. \n[A clink from the knife] \nJONAH (CONT’D) \nAh, I see. Going it alone are we? Heh. Probably for the best. Empathy only \nholds you back in the end. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 200 – Last Words \n5 \nARCHIVIST \nYou’ve failed. \nJONAH \nHave I? \nARCHIVIST \nImmortality. It’s impossible. Even without me, nothing escapes entropy. Not \nforever. Not even fear. \nJONAH \nYes… \nPity. \nI suppose I always knew that, deep down. But it was wonderful while it lasted. \nI’ve seen more than I could have lived in a thousand lifetimes, and every \nmoment was so— \nARCHIVIST \nShut up! \n(Emotional) It ends now, all of it. I am going to take this world that you used \nme to create, and I am going to burn it out. It’s the only way. I’m going to leave \nit a barren, lifeless void, cold and unafraid and then finally, when everyone’s \ngone, and I am all that’s left, I will have the satisfaction of knowing that I’ll be \nleaving these things that you serve trapped and starving in their own private \nhell. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 200 – Last Words \n6 \nJONAH \n…That we serve. \nARCHIVIST \nNot for much longer. I wonder if they’re even capable of fearing their own \nends. \nI look forward to finding out. \nJONAH \nUh, L-Look, John, a-as fun as all this melodrama is, enough is enough. We both \nknow you that don’t have it in you— \n[Footsteps as the Archivist moves in to deliver a solid punch] \nARCHIVIST \nThat was for Sasha. \nJONAH \nJ-John, wait! \n[Another blow] \n(Jonah gasps) \nARCHIVIST \nFor Tim. \nJONAH \n(Afraid) P-Please John! \n[Another solid blow] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 200 – Last Words \n7 \nARCHIVIST \nFor Gertrude, and all the others. \n(Jonah coughs, winded, his breathing laboured) \nJONAH \n(Pitiful) P-Please John... (coughs, wheezing breaths) I don’t want to die. \nARCHIVIST \nNeither did they. \nJONAH \n(Soft, terrified) No, no… N— \nARCHIVIST \nBut no-one escapes at the end. \n[The Archivist stabs deeply] \n(The Archivist makes a cry of effort, and grunts a few times as he pushes the \nblade further in) \n(Jonah makes extended sounds of choking and gurgling pain) \n[The Archivist removes the knife, and the body slumps heavily to \nthe floor] \nJONAH \n(Wetly, indistinct) Good… luck. \n(The archivist gasps) \n[The knife rings out as it hits the marble floor] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 200 – Last Words \n8 \n \n[Statics of all kinds start to rise; glitching electric sounds from all \nsides; there is a high-pitched tone that keeps rising as the \nArchivist reacts] \n(The archivist cries out, his voice now distorted) \nARCHIVIST \n(Pained)—the flaying of skin... burning, retching on the smog of... hide, hide, \nhide... it is not real but still it comes to... falling through the pitch black daa-\naaaaaargh! \n(Pain noises intensify until the Archivist finds …control) \n[Crackling statics fade; in the background the Panopticon’s pulse \nand shifting tones are more active] \n(The Archivist takes some shaky breaths; from now, his voice always has \nsome distortion) \n[The doors slide open, followed by tentative footsteps] \nROSIE \nMr. Magnus, sir? Is everything alright? I, I thought I heard th— \nARCHIVIST \nRosie. You may go. \n[Sliding doors close] \nROSIE \nI, uh, I, I’m sorry Mr Sims but I was—", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 1, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 3725}}
