Now those, I believe, at least \nfor the most part. \nMARTIN \n Then why do you… \nJONATHAN SIMS \n Because I’m scared, Martin!. Because when I record these statements it feels... it feels like I’m being \nwatched. I... I lose myself a bit. And then when I come back, it’s like... like if I admit there may be any \ntruth to it, whatever’s watching will... know somehow. The scepticism, feigning ignorance. It just felt \nsafer. \nMARTIN \n Well... It wasn’t. \nJONATHAN SIMS \n No. No, it wasn’t. Still, it’s not my fault we’re going to be eaten by worms. Speaking of, can you see \nanything? \nMARTIN \n Not much. They’re just... there. \nJONATHAN SIMS \n How many? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG039 – Infestation \n12 \n \nMARTIN \n Too many. And more keep coming up through the floor. I didn’t think they could get through. \nJONATHAN SIMS \n Prentiss \nMARTIN \n No, I can’t s... Oh, there she is. \nJONATHAN SIMS \n What’s she doing? \nMARTIN \n I don’t know. She’s messing with the boxes. She’s holding one up and… ahh! \nJONATHAN SIMS \n What? \nMARTIN \n She’s... She’s destroying them. Sort of. \nJONATHAN SIMS \n Sort of \nMARTIN \n Well, I don’t really know what that stuff coming out of her mouth is, but I think we should probably \nburn them. \nJONATHAN SIMS \n Right. Right. … Why are you here Martin? \nMARTIN \n Well, well, Prentiss is out there and you can’t run so \nJONATHAN SIMS \n I mean at the Archive in general. Why haven’t you quit? \nMARTIN \n Are you giving me my review now? \nJONATHAN SIMS \n No… We’re clearly doing a whole heart-to-heart thing and, truth be told, the question’s been \nbothering me. You’ve been living in the Archives for four months, constant threat of... this. Sleeping \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG039 – Infestation \n13 \n \nwith a fire extinguisher and a corkscrew. Even you must be aware that that’s not normal for an \narchiving job? Why are you still here? \nMARTIN \n [Considering] Don’t really know. I just am. It didn’t feel right to just leave. I’ve typed up a few \nresignation letters, but I just couldn’t bring myself to hand them in. I’m trapped here. It’s like I \ncan’t… move on and the more I struggle, the more I’m stuck. \nJONATHAN SIMS \n Martin...You’re not, uh... You didn’t die here, did you? \nMARTIN \n What? What? N-No… what?! \nJONATHAN SIMS \n No, I just... No, just the way you phrased that... \nMARTIN \n Made you think I was a ghost? \nJONATHAN SIMS \n No… it’s— \nMARTIN \n No, no… it’s just that whatever web these statements have caught you in, well, I’m there too. We all \nare, I think. \n(sigh) \n … A ghost? Really? \nJONATHAN SIMS \n Shut up Martin. \n[CLICK] \n[CLICK] \n[FIRE ALARM] ELIAS Right, tell me again, please. \nSASHA \n You’re kidding. ELIAS You did bring a tape recorder. I just thought John would appreciate as many \nsupplementary recordings as possible. For the record. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG039 – Infestation \n14 \n \nSASHA \n Well, for the record, if we don’t do something now, it won’t matter either way. ELIAS So… these are \nthe worms he and Martin have been going on about? \nSASHA \n The ones terrorising us for months? Yeah! \nELIAS \nto be honest I always thought they were just... overreacting. Other staff have seen them around, but \nno-one’s reported any aggressive behaviour or anything like that. You know how those two are... \nJohn puts on a good show, but sometimes I swear he’s worse than Martin. \nSASHA \n Look, Elias. I don’t know what you think is going on, but I have just seen thousands of… fleshworms \npouring out of the wall! God knows how long they’ve been hiding! Tim might be dead, and the \nothers... \nELIAS \nOf course. The fire alarm was a good move, but it does mean most staff have evacuated, so we’ll \ndeal have to with them ourselves. \nSASHA \n There are thousands of them, Elias. \nELIAS Not quite what I meant. On John’s insistence I recently changed the Archive’s fire suppression \nsystem to use carbon dioxide. Should have done it years ago, really… \nSASHA \n So why hasn’t it gone off? ELIAS Because there isn’t an actual fire. \nSASHA \n Right, right. Can we set it off manually? I think John’s got a lighter somewhere. ELIAS He’s not \nsmoking again, is he? Anyway, it shouldn’t be necessary. There is a manual release, a few floors \ndown. \nSASHA \n Wait. Wait. Will it hurt Martin or John? ELIAS Almost certainly. Er, I’m not a doctor, but I know \ndumping a lot of CO2 on people isn’t generally considered a good idea.
