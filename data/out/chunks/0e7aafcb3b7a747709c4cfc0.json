Not my place to speculate, I suppose. Still, \nthe anti-climax is fascinating. I can only assume they were supposed to be \nbombed at the height of the ritual. Maybe by Japanese aircraft, maybe Allied, \nmaybe both. I wonder what stopped it? A Japanese radar filled with \nspiderwebs? A US destroyer finding itself suddenly alone in the open ocean? \nHeh. We’ll probably never know. \nHeh! I suppose... Ahh, if any of them survived the re-sinking of the Nemesis... \nGod, they must have been kicking themselves in 1945. If they’d just had a bit \nmore patience, waited a few years, sailed her into Nagasaki harbour instead... \nStill, none us can tell the future, can we? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 137 – Nemesis \n \n10 \n \nSo that’s nice. Another one to cross off the list. Doesn’t help with the \nUnknowing, though. \n(Sigh) We still have Dekker’s back up plan, of course, but it’s very risky. To be \nsure, I think the detonation would need to happen from within the Unknowing, \nwhile it was going on. Gerard may have a connection to The Eye, but I’m not \nconvinced it’ll be enough. And I will admit I’ve grown… fond of the boy. \nI wonder, if I told him about Eric, whether he’d follow in his father’s footsteps. \nStill, it’s not like it kept Eric safe in the end. Anyway, point is, you can probably \ndiscount The Slaughter. It had its chance. \n[Tape clicks off. Tape clicks on.] \n(The Archivist sighs heavily.) \nARCHIVIST \nSo. Funny story. Turns out when Daisy broke the lock to get into Elias’ old \noffice... Well, she did a good enough job that it’s not obviously broken. So it \nhasn’t been replaced yet. \nSo I had a look around. Mostly as I remember, but... There’s a box of tapes and \nstatements in the corner, obviously those Elias didn’t feel he could trust me \nwith yet. Or maybe just the ones he was checking himself. Ideally I’d like to \navoid tipping Peter off for as long as possible that I have access, and it turns \nout I don’t Know Elias’ safe combination, not yet anyway. So I just took the first \none that called to me. And it’s... it’s good, I suppose. Glad to know I don’t need \nto worry about a Slaughter ritual, nice to get confirmation that whoever ‘Eric’ \nwas he was Gerry’s father and, well, one assumes, Mary Keay’s partner. But \nnothing with any direction to it. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 137 – Nemesis \n \n11 \n \nEver since I crawled out of that damn coffin I feel like I’ve been… adrift, filling \nin blanks and diving into history, but the only… the breadcrumbs I’m finding \nare stale. Old. What the hell is the Watcher’s Crown? So far the only mention \nof it I’ve even heard is from Gerry, and he didn’t seem to know much about \nwhat it actually meant. And he’s gone now. \nBut if it is the grand ritual of Beholding then— I mean, I need to know about it. \nRight? I feel like I’m on a deadline, like I’m running out time, somehow. And I \ndon’t even know where to go, what to look for, or— Just casting around blindly \nfor more clues to just drop into my lap. Everyone else is running towards \nsomething, or running away and I… \n(Heavy sigh.) \nI don’t know what I’m doing. I’m just tired. Think I might go lie down a while. \nGet a cup of tea. Heh. Daisy’s got me listening to The Archers. I hate it. But it \nfeels nice to hate something that can’t hurt me. I don’t know. That’s it, I, I \nguess. \nEnd recording. \n[Tape clicks off.] \n[The Magnus Archives Theme – Outro] \nThe Magnus Archives is a podcast distributed by Rusty Quill and licensed under \na Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Sharealike 4.0 International \nlicence. \nToday’s episode was written by Jonathan Sims and directed by Alexander J \nNewall.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 5, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 3660}}
