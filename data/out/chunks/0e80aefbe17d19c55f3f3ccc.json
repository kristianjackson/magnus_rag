The trapdoor opens and there’s a silence as Tim and Martin wait \nto see whether they’re safe.] \nTIM \nWhat the hell was that? \nMARTIN \nIt… er… It looked… It kinda looked… \nTIM \nOh don’t say it. \nMARTIN \nIt did, though, didn’t it? \nTIM \nThat wasn’t Sasha. \nMARTIN \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG079 – Hide and Seek \n7 \n \nNo. No, no, it wasn’t. You don’t… you don’t think – \nTIM \nHe told her to go home. Like us! \nMARTIN \nYeah. \nTIM \nAnd she did. \nMARTIN \nYeah. (Pause) \nIt went into the tunnels. \nTIM \nNope. No. Not happening. \nMARTIN \nWe can’t just leave him. \nTIM \nYeah, we can. \nMARTIN \nI’m going. \nTIM \nMartin! Mar… I’m not coming down there with… \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG079 – Hide and Seek \n8 \n \nDamn it. Fine. \n[Tape clicks off. Tape clicks on.] \nARCHIVIST \nDamn. Damn damn damn damn DAMN! \n[The Archivist hits the tunnel wall.] \nI… I took Michael’s door. It was that or face Sa… the thing that was pretending \nto be Sasha. It opened into the tunnels. The tunnels. Not exactly the escape I \nwas hoping for. I’m hardly surprised, must be its idea of a joke. Still, it is… it is a \nhead start I suppose. I have no idea where in the tunnels I am. Or how far \ndown. \nAt least it didn’t leave me trapped in some corridor hell maze… a different \ncorridor hell maze, at least. \nSo I suppose I just… I just wait for now. I don’t think it’s going to just give up, \nand I can’t risk attracting its attention. It might already be down here with me. \nJust stay quiet. \nStay hidden. (Pause) \nGod, I’m an idiot. Smash the table, kill the monster, stupid! Lazy, sloppy \nassumption. Of course the table was binding it. The table is webs and spiders. \nSpiders are something else. They don’t help each other, they oppose, they… \nthey weaken. It was caught in a web, and I… All the pieces were there. And I \njust… I couldn’t see it. (Pause) \nI don’t know how much tape I have left. I’m going to stop recording. To \nconserve it. If – \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG079 – Hide and Seek \n9 \n \nNOT!SASHA \n(Far away) John! \nARCHIVIST \nOh Christ. \n[Tape clicks off. Tape clicks on.] \nMARTIN \nWhat now? We need to hurry. \nTIM \nShhh! \n(Pause) I thought I heard something up ahead. \nMARTIN \nI didn’t hear anything. Why, do you think it was the Sasha-thing? \nTIM \nWill you shut up about that. It wasn’t anything like her. \nMARTIN \nNo, I know, but I mean… like, if you really stretched her out… \nTIM \nWe’re never going to find him down here. \nMARTIN \nSo go get some help. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG079 – Hide and Seek \n10 \n \nTIM \nEr… Elias is probably still in his office. \nMARTIN \nI thought you said he was a waste of a suit. \nTIM \nYeah, well he’s better than nothing. \nMARTIN \nIf you want to go, I understand. \nTIM \nI… I’m not just going to leave you down here. \nMARTIN \nYou were all about quitting. \nTIM \nOh, for God’s sake, this isn’t about you. \nMARTIN \nIt never is. \nTIM \nAlright, fine. Fine. What do you want? What’s your light at the end of these \nspooky damn tunnels? And don’t say “everyone happy forever”, because that’s \nnot happening. (Pause) Well? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG079 – Hide and Seek \n11 \n \nMARTIN \nI don’t know. I don’t know! I want to find out what’s going on. I want to save \nJohn. I want everyone to be fine, and, you know what? If we were all happy \nthat wouldn’t actually be the end of the world. \nTIM \nFine. \nMARTIN \nNo, no it’s not “fine”. You’ve been going on and on and on about how alone \nyou feel because John’s not taking your feelings into account while he’s having \nhis breakdown, but you’re just doing the same thing. We’ve all been going \nthrough this, Tim, but you’re the only one who’s been running away. \nTIM \nOkay, okay. Look, let’s keep going. There’s nobody here. \nMICHAEL \nYes there is. \nTIM \nStay back! \nMICHAEL \nNo. \nMARTIN \nWho are you? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG079 – Hide and Seek \n12 \n \nMICHAEL \nI’m Michael. Did the Archivist not tell you about me? \nMARTIN \nNo? \nMICHAEL \nGood. Surprises are better. \nTIM \nWhat are you doing down here? \nMICHAEL \nProbably watching the Archivist die. Maybe not. Either way is amusing. I… I \nthink it’s called ‘a sport’. \nTIM \nWhat? \nMICHAEL \nI think I might also kill you. It would be easier than killing the Archivist. None of \nyou are protected down here. \nMARTIN \nNo, no, now hang on… \nMICHAEL", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 1, "chunk_count": 5, "chars": 4310}}
