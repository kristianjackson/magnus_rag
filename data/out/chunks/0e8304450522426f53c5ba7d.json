From the tiny slit in \nthe metal, he can see other soldiers: baby-faced friends and the monstrous, \npig-faced enemy, both falling underneath his iron coffin’s advance. He tries to \ncry, but his tears turn to steam. \nHe waits, craving and dreading the final kiss of the bombs, the terrible \nthundering guns so far away that none have ever seen them, raining their \narbitrary ruin upon the endless fields of the dead and dying. They are perhaps \nthe only thing that can fell the tanks, splitting them like rotten fruit beneath \nthe force of their rounds.

To release him from his imprisonment in a single flash of destruction. But \nwhen his prayer is answered, the white-hot agony of melted and crumpled \nmetal is like nothing he could dream of. When Hasanna takes him into triage, \nshe can barely bring herself to look at him. \nShe wheels his stretcher to its place in the stinking, vaulted tent that serves as \na field-hospital, walking through a sea of stained bandages and around the \npiles of festering gauze. She leaves the shuddering man and approaches a \nnearby doctor, its long form crouched over the open chest of a patient, its \nmany hands a frenzy of scalpel, bonesaw, and needle as it giggles beneath its \nsurgeon’s mask. She wants to ask about the wounded, about what to do, \nwhere to put the new ones, how to help them, but even if her voice were not \ndrowned out by the thousand-strong chorus of moans and pained yelling that \nfills the tent, the doctor doesn’t seem to notice her. Hasanna’s eyes fall on the \nentrance to the tent, and she sees the line of civilians, stretching away into the \ndistance. They are no less maimed, their agonies no more bearable, but there \nis simply no room. She tries to apologize, but instead she closes the tent. \nAs she does so, she sees the trench behind her, and, not for the first time, \nHasanna considers trying to run. But there is no mercy for deserters here. On \none side of the trench the hungry guns of the vile enemy wait. And on the \nother, the just guns of heroes will cut you down no slower, save perhaps a \nbreath to call you coward. So, she waits there, in the middle, with the weeping \nwounded and the soon to be dead. Waiting for the enemy to overrun them. \nSometimes, in the distance, Hasanna sees them. The enemy, their skin rough, \ndark, and scaly; their faces twisted around cruel tusks, viciously sharpened \nteeth, and a pair of beady red eyes. Their lips are smeared crimson with the \nblood of children, and their greatest delight is to pluck the eyes of the innocent", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 4, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 2745}}
