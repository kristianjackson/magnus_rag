I think we just might. John? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 181 – Ignorance \n14 \nARCHIVIST \nI can’t use my powers here. I-I can’t protect us. \nMARTIN \nProtect us from what? \nARCHIVIST \nI-It’s going to be difficult to relax with a spider lurking around. \nMIKAELE \nIt gets easier with practice. \n(Beat) \nARCHIVIST \nAlright, I-I guess we can stay. Just for a bit. \nMIKAELE \nExcellent! I haven’t had guests since the world ended! \nARCHIVIST \n(Flat) Lovely. \nMIKAELE \nOh saying that, I suppose there was that insect thing that stumbled in here a \nmonth or so back… \nMARTIN \nEr, ah, insect thing? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 181 – Ignorance \n15 \nMIKAELE \nSome creature of the Crawling Rot. Anyway, it didn’t actually make it into the \nhouse before Annabelle managed to get rid of it, so I refuse to count it as a \nguest. \nMARTIN \nMmm. \nARCHIVIST \nI suppose that makes sense. \nMIKAELE \nOf course, I can’t actually stop things crossing the border into my hideaway, as \nyou both discovered. Another reason I’m content to leave Annabelle to \nwhatever schemes she might be weaving. \nARCHIVIST \nHow big is your safe zone? Is it, is it always the same size? How did this \nhappen? \nMIKAELE \n(Chuckling) Look at him. Not three days without his master spooning \nknowledge into his head, and he can’t bear it! I thought ignorance was meant \nto be bliss. \n(Sighs from Martin and the Archivist) \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 181 – Ignorance \n16 \nMARTIN \nF-F-For what it’s worth, I’d also quite like to know how this all happened? \nMIKAELE \nFine, I’ll tell you how it happened. But you must sit quietly while I tell you. \nMARTIN \nDon’t worry, I have had lots of practice. \n(Beat) \nMIKAELE \nAnd you? \n(Sound of a disgruntled Archivist) \nMARTIN \nHe’ll behave. \n[The ambient sounds in the room continue] \nMIKAELE \nMy story is not a long one. Not the parts that you care about, at least. The \npowers I first learned about from Jurgen Leitner. You’re familiar with him? \nThen I don’t need to explain further. When I say I was one of his assistants, you \nknow exactly the kind of education that would be. Terrifying, fascinating, \nmisguided. The man was a genius and an idiot. It didn’t take me long to see \nwhat he was blind to his whole life: that trying to control the Fears was a good \nway to get yourself killed, or worse. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 181 – Ignorance \n17 \nI left long before he got what was coming to him, and tried to forget what I \nknew. I lived my life, and I lived it well, successful, wealthy, and a little bit \nfeared. Smuggler to the rich and famous. There wasn’t an art dealer or curator \nout there who didn’t pretend not to know me. But the trouble is, once you’ve \nseen backstage, it’s hard to believe in the show anymore. You understand, I’m \nsure. You can never quite shake off the desire to have a peek. To see what’s \nwaiting in the wings. \nWhen I first stumbled across one of the cursed objects, I recognised what it \nwas immediately. It took the form of a leather pouch, filled with 1888 Morgan \nsilver dollars. It was aligned to The Slaughter and... well, let us call it ‘blood \nmoney’ and talk no more of the grisly details. Selling them, well, it went very \nbadly for the buyer... \nBut not for me. I walked away unharmed, and with a healthy profit and \ncounted myself lucky. And then it happened again — this time it was a \npainting: a drab English pastoral that pulled you into The Lonely. Again, I made \na lot of money and remained untouched. It’s the sort of thing to set a man \nthinking about his life, you understand? \nI began to think hard about the world, about my place within it, and about \nfear. About the figure of the merchant, the trader who deals in strange and \ndangerous goods, how it can be found in so many myths and fables, dealing in \nsecond-hand nightmares. And how rarely the merchant themself is ever \npunished in those stories. \nI would love to pretend that it was out of self-preservation that I committed to \nmy new trade, but that would be mostly a lie. To tell you the truth, I got a real \nkick out of playing my role. To think of myself as a purveyor of curses, walking \nsoftly through the most dangerous edges of reality so that the rich and", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 3, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 4292}}
