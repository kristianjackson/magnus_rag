Burn the body. \nARCHIVIST \nOf course. We can wait. I still need to, uh… \nBASIRA \nNo. You go on. I’ll make my own way to London. \n[The backpack is zipped up again] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 179 – Accomplice \n \n27 \nMARTIN \nWhat? No, don’t be daft, it’s not a problem for us to wait while you deal with \nthis. \nBASIRA \nPlease. Just go. \n(Beat) \nMARTIN \nWait, seriously? \nARCHIVIST \nBasira, if you travel on your own, if you’re not with us... I can’t guarantee your \nsafety. \nBASIRA \nGood. \nMARTIN \nBasira, getting yourself hurt isn’t going to help anyone. \nBASIRA \nIt’s just... something I have to do. \nYou said follow the tower, right? \nARCHIVIST \nRight. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 179 – Accomplice \n \n28 \nMARTIN \nNo, no, this is ridiculous. You could die. \nBASIRA \nI’ll do my best not to. \nMARTIN \n(Crosstalk) This isn’t a joke, Basira! \nARCHIVIST \n(Crosstalk) Martin, this is what she needs. \nMARTIN \nNo, no! It’s… it’s complet— \nBASIRA \nIt’ll… It’ll help me. All going well, I’ll meet you both in London. He’ll know \nwhere to find me. \nARCHIVIST \nSo, you won’t mind if I check up on you sometimes? \nBASIRA \nIf you must. But don’t overdo it. I don’t like being watched. \nARCHIVIST \nUnderstood. \nCome on then, Martin. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 179 – Accomplice \n \n29 \nMARTIN \nWh-What? So that’s it, we just head off, and hope you make it? \nBASIRA \nYeah. \nMARTIN \nWhy don’t we rest on it, hmm? I know we all need a moment, and John can \nbarely stand— \nARCHIVIST \nHonestly, I’m starting to feel better already. \n[The Archivist stands up] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nI just need to stretch it out a bit. \n(Grunt from Archivist as he stretches) \n[Martin rises up to standing] \nMARTIN \nWe’re not doing this. \nBASIRA \n(Softly) Martin. Please. \n(Beat) \n[Martin pats dust off himself] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 179 – Accomplice \n \n30 \nMARTIN \nYou’d better look after yourself. \nBASIRA \nI will. \nARCHIVIST \n(Gently) Come on. \n[Footsteps as Martin walks away] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nFor what it’s worth... I’m sorry it had to work out like this. \nBASIRA \nI’m not. \n[Tape clicks off] \n[The Magnus Archives Theme – Outro] \nJONATHAN SIMS \nThe Magnus Archives is a podcast distributed by Rusty Quill and licensed under \na Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Sharealike 4.0 International \nlicence.
