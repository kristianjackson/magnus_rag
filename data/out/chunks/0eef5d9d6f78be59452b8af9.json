For every test I was told to do, I \ncould have listed a half-dozen studies citing similar research from the ISS, most \nof which had had pretty conclusive results. If you had told me I was just being \ninstructed to do the same things they did over there, but two years later, I’d \nhave been hard pressed to argue. \n \nBut there was something else. A different sort of worry that was building up \ninside me. It was like a gradual increase of air pressure. You never notice it \nhappening until your ears pop. I didn’t realise how intense the sensation had \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG106 ‘A Matter of Perspective’ \n \n5 \n \ngotten until all at once I knew what it was, what I was feeling. It was the sense \nof a presence, of there being something out there. Something that wasn’t the \nEarth. And it was getting closer. \n \nWhen it started, I tried to talk to Manuela about it, but she seemed to think I \nwas talking about aliens and quickly changed the subject. I suppose in a way I \nwas, but nothing like she was imagining. Alien might be the best word for that \npresence, but not because we sat on the edge of outer space, but because \nwhat it made me feel was beyond anything I had words for. And still it grew \ncloser. \n \nWhen this thing, this being, finally called out, I didn’t just hear it. I felt it, \nvibrating through me with such a shuddering intensity that I was sure my \nbones would break into powder inside my skin. The whole station shook \nviolently, rattling and pitching. My first instinct was to check that the Earth was \nstill below us, and not the victim of some dreadful cosmic disaster, but when I \nreached the window it still hung there serenely below us. As I looked, I saw \ndrops of red floating through the air in front of me. I reached up to my ears \nand my hand came away wet. Don’t try to tell me sound can’t travel in a \nvacuum. I know. \n \nI pushed off towards my quarters and the medical kit, but as I began to move \nthrough the station, I stopped. I didn’t grab or hit anything; I did nothing to \nslow my momentum. I just stopped, floating there, motionless, feeling like the \nwhole of existence was frozen in place. Then slowly, carefully, I went to grab \none of the handles, to pull myself out of this zero-gravity limbo, but I couldn’t \nreach. The station was cramped, so cramped that I could only fully stretch out \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG106 ‘A Matter of Perspective’ \n \n6 \n \nin the section used to exercise, but now, somehow, in this tiny corridor, I \ncouldn’t reach the walls. I flailed and I grabbed and I shouted, but somehow it \nwas all just too far away. And I knew all at once that I would float there, \nmotionless, until I died. And I saw the pointless illusion of the station, of the \nplanet below, all hiding me from the uncaring expanse of the universe in which \nI was now eternally trapped. The station, a hollow pretence of shell that did \nnothing to separate me from the void. And that cry came again, so loud and \nlong and deep that it couldn’t not be the sound of a living thing, so vast and so \nancient that thinking about it made me weep. And I screamed in turn. \n \nMy hand touched the rail at the exact moment that Manuela came to check on \nme. I was moving again, and she asked if I was alright, though she clearly had \nno interest in the answer. She said she’d felt the station shake, but when I \npressed, she claimed she hadn’t heard anything. Her eyes were red and I \nnoticed for the first time that the tips of her fingers were burned. I don’t know \nwhy I asked her really. I knew then that she hadn’t heard it, that she would \nnever hear it. And I felt completely alone. I remember I almost envied Chilcott, \nbecause at least he had known what he was signing up for. \n \nThe next month passed more normally, I think. Though beyond a certain point, \nat the edge of everything you’ve ever known, the word ‘normal’ loses its \nmeaning. Manuela became more and more withdrawn – more focused on her \nown research, whatever it might have been – while I more or less stopped \ndoing mine entirely. I got no new instructions. I would find myself staring out \ninto space for a few minutes, and then, when I checked the time, hours would \nhave passed.
