How do we play this one? \nARCHIVIST \nYou get Martin to safety, then I deal with Annabelle Cane. \nBASIRA \nRight. \n(Beat) \nI think we should hear her out first. \nARCHIVIST \nExcuse me? \nBASIRA \nBefore you “deal with her”, we should try to get some answers. All of this... \ntaking Martin... she wants to talk. \nARCHIVIST \nShe’s had plenty of chances. She didn’t need to kidnap him. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 197 – Connected \n8 \nBASIRA \nSure, but maybe she— \nWhat? What’s with the look? \nARCHIVIST \nHow are you feeling, Basira? \nBASIRA \n(Sharply) Do you want to look inside my head? See if it’s full of spiders? \nARCHIVIST \nI— \nNo, I’m sorry. I-I trust you. \nBASIRA \nHow are you feeling? \nARCHIVIST \n(Sighs) Yes, alright, you don’t need to make a point. \nBASIRA \nYes I do. You’re too close to this, and I need to make sure you aren’t going to \ndo anything dumb. \nSituation like this, we can’t make rash assumptions. Right? \nARCHIVIST \nRight. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 197 – Connected \n9 \nBut if she hurts Martin, all bets are off. \nBASIRA \nShe hurts Martin, I'll be right there with you. \n[They begin to move off] \n[Tape clicks off] \n[Tape clicks on] \n[The Web; the deep tail-end of a large twanging sound; multiple \nchitinous, rewinding tape sounds pass by with it] \n[In every direction comes the sound of many recorders playing \nstatements, too faint to be heard distinctly although the voices are \nrecognisably those of archive staff] \nANNABELLE \nHmm. He’s getting close. \nMARTIN \n(Archly) As if you could hear him over all this racket. \nANNABELLE \n(Chuckles) I am sorry you find them irritating. \nThey’re a side effect of the very specific way this web has been spun. \nI thought you liked his voice? \n[Sticky web sound as Martin responds] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 197 – Connected \n10 \nMARTIN \nI do, when it’s his voice. I’ve never liked the statements. It always felt— Yeah. \nANNABELLE \nWell, you can trust me when I say you’ll be hearing his real voice very soon. \nMARTIN \nI can’t see anything. How can you even tell? \nANNABELLE \nVibrations. \nMARTIN \nUrgh, yes, web, vibrations, sure. Yeah but that’s not actually what’s happening \nhere is it? So why don’t you just tell me straight? It’s not like I’m going to run \noff. I’d only trip over my own feet and fall in, even if I tried. \nANNABELLE \nIt’s a good way to visualise these things. Symbols and metaphor… they give \neasy channels for the Great Powers to flow through. Ready forms for their \nenergy to manifest. \nMARTIN \nBlah, blah, dream logic, blah. I’ve had this lecture before. \nANNABELLE \nYou’d prefer we stay silent until he arrives? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 197 – Connected \n11 \nMARTIN \nI’d hardly call this silence. \nANNABELLE \nI’d stop them if I could. \nMARTIN \nFine. \nLet’s talk then. \nANNABELLE \nAlright. \n(Long beat) \nIs there anything you want to talk about? \nMARTIN \nI don’t know! It’s kind of hard to think of small talk suspended over an endless \nvoid! \nANNABELLE \nYou’re perfectly safe as long as you don’t do anything foolish and unstick \nyourself. \nMARTIN \nAh, yeah, yeah. You say that, but it seems like you’ve got this whole thing \nprepared for John, and I-I don’t really know whether I should be trying to derail \nit, or, or whether that’s just what you want me to do, and, and so doing \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 197 – Connected \n12 \nnothing is actually the right thing, y’know? And… you’re a hard person to talk \nto. \nANNABELLE \nWhy? Because of what I say, or because of the assumptions you make about \nmy motives? \n(Martin makes a frustrated exhale) \nMARTIN \nEither. Both. \nANNABELLE \nI see. \n(Beat) \n(Martin makes an annoyed noise) \nWe could play a game? \nMARTIN \nUhhh… \nANNABELLE \nTwenty questions? Animal, vegetable or mineral? \n(Martin makes an annoyed exhale) \nMARTIN \n(Sarcastic) Animal. Does it have eight legs? Yes. Is it a spider? Yes.
