Still, the opportunity was too good to pass up and Stavo had \nsome contacts within the Cairo police force, so was able to get us a pair of \nwell-bribed policemen to stick around and give us at least a passing air of \nrespectability for any civilian who might stumble across us. So off I went to \nEgypt, dreaming of finding a new pyramid. I know that sounds daft, but most \npyramids are not as huge, obvious or intact as those at Giza. After four or five \nthousand years, most of just look like hills or sometimes dunes and there could \nbe any number of them waiting undiscovered beneath the Egyptian earth. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 064 – Burial Rites \n \n6 \n \nI was surprised by how easily we found it. Stavo had gotten a location from the \nuniversity's application and Grigori quickly located a likely looking geological \nformation on the satellite images. Less than 14 hours after I got the call, I was \nstanding, shovel in hand, in the middle of the Eastern Desert, breaking ground \nover a tomb that had been unopened for millennia. It was exhilarating. \nGrigori had done some work to make sure we were digging at what he believed \nto be the entrance and it only took a day to unearth the slab of limestone that \ncovered it. I could see hieroglyphics etched onto the surface, but they were far \ntoo worn to read. Large upon the stone was carved the closed loop of a shen \nring, the symbol of infinity. This struck me as odd, since just based on the \nentrance, I was pretty sure this tomb was at least fourth dynasty and the shen \nring was usually used to designate a royal burial place. But there were no \ncartouches among the hieroglyphics on the entrance, which I would have \nexpected if the tomb contained royalty. It was a subterranean pyramid, I was \nnow quite certain, but if it housed the remains of a Pharaoh, their name had \nnot been protected upon death. \nBarry and Paul wasted no time in hoisting the limestone slab off the entrance, \nrevealing a dark, yawning passage. In the heat of the sun I was acutely aware \nof the cold draft seeping out of the opening. Stavo gave it a look over and \nasked if there was anything we could salvage from the hieroglyphics. I gave \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 064 – Burial Rites \n \n7 \n \nhim directions to chip off the shen ring and take photos of the rest for later \nstudy. Before you ask, I don't have access to those photos - Stavo still has the \ncamera. You know, in my haste to make sure everything was going smoothly, it \nhadn't really hit me what we had found until that moment, as I stood on the \nthreshold and breathed air 4,000 years old. It was dry and smelt faintly of \ncedarwood. I had just helped discover an untouched tomb of the fourth \ndynasty. We collected our bags, picks and torches and headed into the dark. \nTwo things struck me as soon as we were inside. The first was how big the \nplace was. The passages were far wider than I would have assumed, based on \nmy research on comparable tombs. The other was that there was also \nsignificantly less ornamentation. And by less, I mean none. The walls were \nbare, unpainted, and for a horrible moment I thought it might already have \nbeen ransacked. Stavo had the same thought, but Grigori assured us that the \ncondition of the entrance indicated that it hadn't been opened since it was \noriginally sealed. The tomb hadn't been robbed; it was just empty. \nAs we headed deeper, I began to notice passages branching off our path. In \neach case they seemed to be heading more or less back the way we came. I \ncalled a halt and Stavo and I took a few minutes to explore one of them. At \nfirst, they seemed to be heading back towards the surface, but further", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 2, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 3771}}
