They’re actually quite good. \nLUCIA \nIf you say so. \n[Tape clicks off. Tape clicks on] \nGERTRUDE \nWell, that is a relief. When I heard there had been survivors of the Last Feast, I \nwas rather concerned that one of them might be able to positively identify me, \nwhich could land me in all sorts of trouble. But she doesn’t seem to remember \nme at all. Tom Haan might be a bit more of a problem, as it looks like he also \nsurvived, but I’m hopeful he has been weakened enough by this failure to not \nbe an issue in the near future. Hopefully he’ll fade away or burn out, as they \ntend to when robbed of their purpose. Still, I should keep a watch on him in \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 130 – Meat \n12 \n \ncase of any erratic behaviour that might lead to complications. Also worth \nwatching out for any additional esoteric fallout from the ritual attempt, like \nthat Carlisle boy down in Wandsworth. \nDekker really came through with the explosives. It almost felt like cheating. Sad \nabout the loss of history, but Ms. Wright didn’t seem to think the old gnostic \nchurch got many visitors anyway. I’m honestly impressed she had the strength \nto get through it, even if she does seem to have been deeply affected by it. \nShame about the dreams. I would avoid them if I could. \nAt least we know for sure that these grand rituals can be disrupted by \nconventional means, though a more nuanced approach will be needed for \nsome of them, I’m sure. Also, I can’t rely on having this much lead time. I’ve \nhad ten years’ tracking supplicants drawn by the siren call of flesh, watching \nthem gradually stockpiling meat. Very useful in terms of preparation time for \nderailing the final push, but in future I think I need to get a little bit more ... \nproactive. \n[Tape clicks off. Tape clicks on] \nARCHIVIST \nI found this tape tucked in a corner of my desk drawer, covered in cobwebs. I \nsuppose subtlety has gone out the window a bit, and the question is now \nsimply how much I trust the Spider to have my best interests at heart. Hm. I \nsuspect my assuming it has a heart might be a clue I’m looking at this the \nwrong way. Even so, and leaving aside the matter of Gertrude’s actions for a \nmoment, what is it trying to tell me with this? Is it about rituals? About getting \nDaisy back? About… about an anchor... What was it she said, “The siren call of \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 130 – Meat \n13 \n \nflesh?” Hm. It’s possible, I suppose. It would hurt, but... Well, what’s another \nscar? \nIt’s been two weeks since I heard from Basira. I’m not waiting any longer. I’m \ngetting Daisy back. \nEnd recording. \n[Tape clicks off] \n[The Magnus Archives Theme – Outro] \nThe Magnus Archives is a podcast distributed by Rusty Quill and licensed under \na Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Sharealike 4.0 International \nlicence. \nToday’s episode was written by Jonathan Sims and directed by Alexander J \nNewall. \nIt featured: Jonathan Sims as the Archivist, Sue Sims as Gertrude Robinson, and \nBeth Eyre as Lucia Wright.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 5, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 3044}}
