I always felt Frankenstein should have been an engineer, not a \nmedical student, as reading that book, I couldn’t help but see some of myself \nin that obsession. But I suppose everyone’s already done the monster as a \nrobot, haven’t they? And none made it move as well as Neil did in 1975 when \nhe worked on Agents of Orion. \nThat was one of his movies that I went back to time and again. The way the \nrobot moved, the weight and life he managed to give each clanking, hissing \nstep. I was 14 when I managed to hunt down a copy on Betamax, and I just \nwatched that scene over and over again. I was already obsessed with Neil’s \nwork by then, mostly his sci-fi stuff from the late 70s: Beyond Time, Under New \nYork, The Crawling Ones, all that sort of thing. His earlier stuff I certainly \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 136 – The Puppeteer \n7 \n \nenjoyed, but for all my fondness for that animated minotaur, his stop-motion \nwork never really grabbed me like his animatronics. The way Neil tells it, he \nsplit from his partner, Gabe, in 1972, and sculpting for stop-motion had never \nreally had the same charm after that. “Besides,” he always told me, “I’m a \npuppeteer at heart.” \nThat was certainly true. Neil never really talked about his early life, but \nsometimes, when the medication was kicking in, he would tell me about his \ntraining with puppets. I could never figure out what performance school he \nlearned at, or even if he went to one at all, but he would twist his fingers into \nall sorts of bizarre and intricate shapes, until I could see the strings flowing \nover them. “We made them dance,” he would say, wonder and nostalgia in his \nvoice. “Oh, how we made them dance!” \nGrowing up as an eighties cinephile and devotee of his art, I obviously had to \nlearn to love horror. It wasn’t just his work with John Carpenter, either – it was \ncommon knowledge that Neil was deliberately seeking out darker and more \ngrotesque works, though no-one knew why. Dead Sky, The Nightmare Children, \nForty Winks – they were all in this period of his career, which culminated, of \ncourse, with Toyshop. While it’s now regarded as a cult classic, I still remember \nthe editorials at the time condemning it, and some even called it “the end of \nNeil Lagorio.” I think it was too late to officially be a “video nasty”, but it was \ncertainly referred to as such in the UK press. He told me later that he just \nneeded to get it out of his system, though I don’t know if I entirely believed \nhim. \nWhatever the case, my own relationship with him started in 1992, on the set of \nJewel of the Amazon, a mid-budget, effects-driven Kevin Costner vehicle.
