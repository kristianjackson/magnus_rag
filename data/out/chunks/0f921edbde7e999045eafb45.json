But it knows. It knows!” Elias has no way to \ncomfort him. He can’t even understand what he’s talking about. \n[A few more lighter flicks] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nAnd so on that, the last night of Allan Schreiber’s life, he just gets him high, and \nleaves him to sleep it off. \n[Sounds from the memory end; replaced with Elias’ office \nclock ticking] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \n“I... don’t know,” Elias says at last. “You can never really be sure, can you?” \nBeyond that stretch of polished mahogany, so well waxed that Elias’ pale, \nsweating face is clearly visible, James Wright’s smile remains unchanged. \nJONAH/ELIAS \nWho indeed? Now tell me: why do you want this job? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 193 – A Stern Look \n \n15 \nARCHIVIST \nElias tries not to visibly sigh with relief. This, at least, is a question to which he \nhas prepared an answer. He clears his throat slightly, shaking off the lingering \nimage of Allan’s body. \n“Oh— w-well,” he begins, “I’ve always had the greatest respect for the work \nput out by this institute on mythological traditions, especially some of the \nrecent papers on Indo-European traditions which was very useful for my \ndissertation on—” \nHe stops. Those eyes. They know. They can see right through all his bullshit, \nright to the core of him. They know what he really thinks. A position in a small, \nobscure little academic organisation, the first step on a path to the position he \nactually deserves. This place could be anything, as far as he’s concerned. \nMedical research, a grant foundation… it doesn’t really matter. So why choose \nthe Magnus Institute? Barely known outside its own little sphere of influence, \nhardly respected among the wider academic community. \n[Elias’ ticking clock is replaced by a grandfather clock; sombre piano \nmusic plays in the background] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nHis father's words came to him again, as they always had, through childhood, \nboarding school, university. “You’re a smart boy, Elias, but you’re lazy. You \nhave every advantage that I and this world could possibly provide, and yet you \ninsist on squandering them. Don’t think I don’t see you, looking at those other \nchildren with envy, as though their meaningless little lives could contain \nanything of substance, anything for a Bouchard to aspire to. You are better \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 193 – A Stern Look \n \n16 \nthan them, and they know it. And it is your job to prove worthy of that \ndistinction.” \nElias’ stomach tightened at the memory, the fierce judgement in his father’s \neyes. Even laid out in a casket, it was as if he had looked at Elias with disdain. \nWhat should he say? \n[Sounds from the memory fade out, replaced with Elias’ office \nclock ticking] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nThat he had no idea why he wanted this job? That he was all alone in the \nworld, no friends, no family, nothing but the deep certainty that he deserved \nbetter. That he was destined to be important. That it was in his blood. \nWhere had he heard about this job opening? Had it been in a newspaper? He \nknew no-one who worked here, but received a letter anyway inviting him to \ninterview. \n[Chair creaks with uncomfortable movement] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nNow that he thought about it, he hadn’t even sent out a CV. Yet somehow he \nfound himself sat across from this man whose smile hadn’t moved the whole \ntime, and whose eyes seemed to know why he was here far better than he did. \n“I, uh,” Elias’ voice wavered, paused. “I’ve always had the greatest respect for \nthe work put out by this institute on mythological traditions, especially some of \nthe recent papers on Indo-European traditions which was very—” \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 193 – A Stern Look \n \n17 \n[Hissing static starts; joining the Panopticon sounds that rise each \ntime Jonah/Elias talks] \nJONAH/ELIAS \nEnough. Tell me, why are you here? \n[The Panopticon background noises & static continues] \nARCHIVIST \nI... I don’t know. \nJONAH/ELIAS \nWere you drawn here? \nARCHIVIST \nYes. I was. \nJONAH/ELIAS \nAgainst your will? \nARCHIVIST \nNo. \nJONAH/ELIAS \nThen why did you heed the call? \nARCHIVIST \n(With Panopticon room reverb) Because... this is the place I know I should be.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 5, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 4191}}
