He was looking at me strangely, but we were both quiet. \nIt had been a very strange day. After an hour or so, we heard cries \nfrom the trapdoor. It was Martin. He was shouting about a body. We \ngot him out, and Elias tried to get him to calm down and explain. He \nsaid he’d found the body of the previous Archivist, Gertrude \nRobinson, and that was when Elias called the police. I tried to calm \nhim down, but he was in bad shape. The police arrived, and I gave \nthem pretty much this same statements. \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nRight... Right. What about the tape? You had the tape recorder, the \none I’d just recorded Mr. Ramao’s statement on, but when you gave \nit back, it was empty. \nNOT!SASHA \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG040 – Human Remains \n16 \n \nYes, I dropped it a few times. The eject button must have been hit. I \ndidn’t notice until you pointed it out. It’s probably around \nsomewhere. Is it that important \n JONATHAN SIMS \nIt’s important to me. Are you feeling alright? You seem a bit out of \nit. \nNOT!SASHA \nYes, I’m very tired. It’s hard to keep track of things sometimes. \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nRight. Go get some rest, Sasha. \n \nNOT!SASHA \nYes. I will. \n[CLICK] \n[CLICK] \n \n MARTIN \nI mean, I already told the police. \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nWell, now tell me. I need to hear it. I need to record it. \n \nMARTIN \nI... alright. Are you okay? \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nFine. Painkillers are starting to wear off, but... It’s fine. Statement of \nMartin Blackwood, archival assistant, etcetera, etcetera. Go. \n \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG040 – Human Remains \n17 \n \n \nMARTIN \nRight. Well, I was doing some background checks for case \n0081709, when you and Sasha started screaming, so I went to \nche… \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nYes, yes, I was there! I was with you for almost the whole time, and \nthat tape survived just fine. \n \nMARTIN \nSorry. \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nAh, it’s fine. I just... I only need from when you got separated. From \nwhen you got lost in the tunnels. \n \nMARTIN \nNo, I mean… I’m sorry I left you. \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \n…Oh Martin. \n \nMARTIN \n(Tearfully) It was an accident. I thought you two were with me! I \nmean, the worms came at us, and they were so much faster, and \nthen there was the gas, and the running, and I just… I, I thought \nyou were right behind me. But when I turned round you were gone. \nYou were both gone. It was an accident. \n \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG040 – Human Remains \n18 \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nI know. It's fine, Martin. Everybody’s… \n(sigh) \nEveryone’s fine… I just need you to tell me what happened next, \nand then it’s finished. \n \nMARTIN \nAlright. So, um, yeah, we got separated so I, I tried shouting, but \nyou didn’t answer. The walls seemed to kill the sound dead and \nthere wasn’t any echo. They were old stone, like, really old, and \nthere was no light except my torch. I, I always keep my torch on me, \never since I moved into the Archives, so I had that, at least. \nI wandered for a while. It’s a, it’s a maze down there, John. I don’t \nknow how far the passages go. Maybe miles. I think it must be the \nold Millbank Prison, like Tim was saying before. I even found some \nstairs at one point, but I really didn’t want to go down them. I hadn’t \nseen any worms for a few minutes, and weirdly enough that \nactually started to worry me, like, if there weren’t any worms then \nI’d gone too far from the Institute. And there was more dust in \nthose corridors too, and dead rats, even some discarded wine \nbottles. At one point there was an empty packet of mint imperials— \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nMartin… \n \n \nMARTIN \nSorry. Yeah. Um. I was trying to go back, not that I knew what back \neven meant down there, when I heard the scream. I don’t even \nknow how to go about describing it, but I thought... well I hoped...", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 5, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 3734}}
