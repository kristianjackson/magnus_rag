There’s no way I can reasonably deny it at this \npoint; the evidence provided by the police was overwhelming and I saw his \nshed myself. I’m not here to try and clear his name. There wouldn’t be much \npoint anyway as I’m sure you know he died in prison last year. Seven years isn’t \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG009 – A Father’s Love \n2 \n \nmuch to have served out of a life sentence but I doubt it was the early parole \nhe’d have hoped for. \nSorry, maybe that wasn’t in the best taste. Still, his passing is why I feel like I \ncan tell this story; something I’ve never really felt free to do before now. I \nalways expected him to talk about it during the media frenzy that surrounded \nhis trial but for whatever reason he kept quiet. I think I understand a bit more \nnow why he never spoke about it, preferring people draw their own \nconclusions, but at the time I couldn’t fathom why he just sat there silently, \nletting others talk for him. I’d like to tell someone now, though, and I’ve only \nrecently finished my court-appointed counselling sessions, so I’d rather not tell \nthe tabloids and have “My Father Killed To Fuel Cult Magic, Says Daughter of \nMonster” splashed over page 7 of the weekend edition. So that leaves you \nguys. Respectable is hardly the word I’d use but it’s better than nothing. \nSo yes, my father killed at least forty people over the course of the five years \nprior to his arrest in 1995. I won’t recount the lurid details – if you’re \ninterested you can look up Robert Montauk in the newspaper archive of any \nlibrary. There’ll be plenty there: the papers clearly didn’t care much about the \nAmerican bombing, because in April of that year they seemed to be talking \nabout nothing but my father. There are also a couple of books on him, none of \nwhich I can really recommend, but I guess Ray Cowan’s No Bodies in the Shed \nis the closest to what I’d consider accurate, although it does imply that I was an \naccomplice despite the fact that I was 12 years old at the time. Honestly, I \ndiscovered most of the details from the newspapers and the court, just like \neveryone else. My father spent my formative years killing dozens of people \nand I had no idea. But the more I think back over my childhood, the more sure \nI am that there was something else going on. I don’t have any theories as to", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 0, "chunk_count": 10, "chars": 3163}}
