Perhaps it changed every time I opened it, even if I didn’t read \nthe page, every interaction changing my fate, though none, it seemed, made it \nless horrible. \nI went to stay with a friend of mine, John Kendrick, for a few days. He could see \nsomething was wrong, and thankfully didn’t ask me about it, instead just trying \nto cheer me up. I tried to forget it, to ignore what I had read but it’s not the \nsort of thing that ever truly leaves your mind, and eventually I found myself \nback in that lonely house, staring at that damned book. Had it changed? Were \nthe words now within that raggedy black covering already describing a new, \n\nmore painful end for me? Or had it shown mercy, and granted me a quicker \ndeath? \nI tried to destroy it of course. It wouldn’t burn and water didn’t seem to \ndamage the pages. Spilled ink didn’t mark them and, though I considered \nburying it, I couldn’t shake the feeling that those who came before me must \nhave tried all the same things. I read my death again, as it told me how I was to \nbe partially decapitated by a falling piece of masonry on New Years Eve, 2011. \nI try not to read it, of course. But sometimes it just gets too much. Every time \nthe date gets closer, and the manner of my death stays just as awful. When I \nclose the book I wonder, are those same words still there, squatting and biding \ntheir time, or have they already changed into some new unknown terror that I \ncan neither know nor avoid, waiting to spring on me. \nI haven’t brought the book with me to show you, and I am not planning to \nwrite up a will. I don’t know whether it’s ownership of the thing that makes it \nwrite your fate or just reading it. Either way, I will keep it as long as it will let \nme. Until I reach an end that may be more gruesome but is fundamentally no \ndifferent than that which awaits us all. \nARCHIVIST \nStatement ends. \nMr Murray disappeared shortly after making this statement. As far as we can \ndetermine, it was a voluntary disappearance, as the lease on his flat was \ncancelled shortly beforehand, and he resigned from his post as an \nadministrator with Birmingham City Council. Since then, he has apparently \nbeen successful in changing or hiding his identity, and neither Sasha nor Tim \nhave had any luck locating him, though Tim was able to confirm that one Philip \n\nDoah passed away after falling under a train at Birmingham New Street Station \non the 1st of August 2003. There are also no accident reports we were able to \nfind that matched any of his supposed predicted deaths. I’ve discouraged \nfurther attempts to locate Mr Murray, as even the latest of his possible ends \nwas some years ago now, and if he was in any way correct about the book, he \nis most likely long dead. \nNotable in his account, however, is the absence of any indication that this book \nwas ever possessed by Jurgen Leitner. It seems to support the theory that, \nwhatever these books are, Leitner is not entirely responsible for them. \nOne other slightly encouraging piece of news is apparently IT have finally \nfigured out what’s wrong with Sasha’s computer – it’s been getting \nauthentication errors when attempting to connect with external devices or \nnetworks. I can’t say I’m fully familiar with exactly what that means, but \nhopefully now the problem has been isolated, they can come up with some \nsort of workaround, and future investigations will be able to once again fully \nutilise her technical skills. \nEnd recording. \n[Tape clicks off. Tape clicks on.] \nSupplemental. \nBooks. Again and again it always seems to come back to those books. There are \nother artifacts that hold sinister power, certainly, but none of them seem to be \nquite so prevalent or insidious as those damn books. But why? I had always \nassumed that Leitner had created them somehow, leasing parts of his own \ndamned soul give them power, or some similar nonsense. But no.
