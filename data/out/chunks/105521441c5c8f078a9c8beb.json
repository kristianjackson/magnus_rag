Episode one hundred and forty-\nfive. Infectious Doubts. \n[Tape clicks on.] \nGERTRUDE \nYou don’t mind, do you? \nARTHUR \nOf course, I do. \nGERTRUDE \nWell, that’s a shame. \nARTHUR \nIf I really wanted to kill you, that thing couldn’t stop me. \nGERTRUDE \nIf that were a possibility, Arthur, I should hardly have agreed to meet you. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 145 – Infectious Doubts \n \n2 \n \nARTHUR \nHmph. Yeah, you would. You’d have set up something up, tried to get me first. \nGERTRUDE \nIf I wanted you dead, Arthur, there are much simpler ways to do it. \nARTHUR \nYeah? Think you know how? \nGERTRUDE \nI do, yes, and I am very willing to, if necessary. \nARTHUR \nWell, I’m sure I’m shaking in my boots. \nGERTRUDE \n(Snorts) Look, Arthur, I need you to understand that this isn’t simple posturing. \nI don’t see a way we can meaningfully progress this conversation while you’re \nunder the impression that your threats mean anything to me. \nARTHUR \nBig talk. But Agnes is dead, and I don’t know if you’ve heard, but your little \nwoodland circle’s been broken. So, I don’t really see anything getting in my \nway if I wanted to burn the flesh off your snarky bones. \nGERTRUDE \nHuh, I assume you haven’t checked on Eugene, then? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 145 – Infectious Doubts \n \n3 \n \nARTHUR \n... What? \nGERTRUDE \nEugene, well, whatever-his-name-was – Vanderbelt or somesuch. You sent him \nto intimidate me a couple of years ago, you must remember. Of course, you \nknow him. Used to live in Beckenham, but moved out to that flat in Ilford last \nyear. \nARTHUR \n(Suspicious) Yeah ... \nGERTRUDE \nWell, he hasn’t been at your little meetings the last two weeks, has he? I \nsuppose no-one’s looked into it yet. Not surprising, he seemed a thoroughly \nunpleasant little man. \nARTHUR \nAre you— Did— \nGERTRUDE \nTell you what, why don’t you make a few calls, check it out, and then we can \ncontinue our little discussion. Alright? \n[Tape clicks off. Tape clicks on.] \nGERTRUDE \nWell? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 145 – Infectious Doubts \n \n4 \n \n[Arthur puts down the phone] \nARTHUR \nHow’d you do it? \nGERTRUDE \nYou don’t need to know that. What you do need to know, is I can do it again if I \nneed to, to you or any of your lackeys, if I need to. \nARTHUR \n(Scoffs) Not mine anymore. \nGERTRUDE \nOh no, I forgot your authority isn’t what it used to be these days. \nARTHUR \nYeah. \nGERTRUDE \nWell, if a warning from you isn't going to convince them, let me know. I’d be \nhappy to provide a further example. \nARTHUR \nYou’ve made your point. \nGERTRUDE \nGood. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 145 – Infectious Doubts \n \n5 \n \nARTHUR \nEugene... It, it hurt him? \nGERTRUDE \nOh yes. I’m sure your master was delighted with how awful his death was. \nARTHUR \nDon’t push it. \nGERTRUDE \nYou know, thinking about it, the amount of pain and loss and legitimate \ndevastation I’ve cause among your little cult over the last, what, forty years? I \nthink The Desolation is probably very fond of me. \nARTHUR \nThat’s blasphemy, that is. \nGERTRUDE \nIs it? Or maybe you just picked a bad god. \nARTHUR \nShut it! I don’t have to listen to this. \nGERTRUDE \nHm, then feel free to try and leave. \n…", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 0, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 3367}}
