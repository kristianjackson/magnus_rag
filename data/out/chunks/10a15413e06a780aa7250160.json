Mind you, lot of trouble to go through just to lose a rib, \nso maybe not. \n\nThat’s it, then. \nDo you want to do this, or what? \nARCHIVIST \nThat’s it? (He snorts) Hardly worth a rib. \n[Jared looms forward] \nARCHIVIST (Cont.) \n(Placatingly) Alright! Alright. Is it, uh… Is is going to hurt? \nJARED \nDunno. Doesn't hurt me. \n(The Archivist makes noises of pain.) \n[Extended sounds of meat and bone movement] \nJARED (Cont.) \nThat’s yours. What’s it for? \n(The Archivist keeps making pained noises) \nARCHIVIST \n(Stumblingly) Um… A, A-An anchor \nJARED \nHuh. Right. Anyway, this one’s for me. \n[More mobile meat noises, this time of insertion] \n\nHuh. That’s a weird one. Not sure I like it. Still. Mine now. \nARCHIVIST \n(Weakly) I supp… I suppose it is. \nJARED \nYou said I could leave. \nARCHIVIST \nY-yes. Just, uh... I-If you start walking that way, I-I-I’m sure there’ll be a door \nfor you. \nJARED \nThere’d better be. \nARCHIVIST \nY-Y-Yes, I, uh... \n[It sounds as if the Archivist collapses. The tape clicks off. The tape clicks on.] \nHELEN \nStill alive? \nMELANIE \nSeems to be, yes. \nHELEN \nAnd he’s certainly holding a bone. For some reason. \n\nMELANIE \nSaid it was going to be an anchor. \nHELEN \nHmm. Bodies are strange. Rather glad they’re not my concern anymore. \nMELANIE \nMust be nice. \nHELEN \nIt really is. \nMELANIE \nDid you let that... thing go? \nHELEN \nHe found a door. \nMELANIE \n(Alert) Where did he come out? \nHELEN \nThe door may have been in a wall some distance above a river. \nMELANIE \n(Laughs) Nice. \nARCHIVIST \n\n(Groggy) It… um? \nHELEN \nAll done. \nARCHIVIST \nUh... (Winces) Thank you. For your… uh. For your help. \nHELEN \nYou are very welcome. I have decided that I support what you are doing, and I \nam happy to assist. I think we’ll all be much happier this way. \nMELANIE \nBasira’s not going to be happy that you let him out. \nARCHIVIST \nBasira isn’t here. And if this works, I’ll have Daisy waiting for her when she gets \nback, so I don’t think she’ll be thinking too much about Jared. \nMELANIE \nYou’re going now? \n(The Archivist makes a pained chuckle, followed by pained breathing.) \nARCHIVIST \nNo. No, now I am going for a lie down. That was... that was not what I \nexpected. \nMELANIE \n\nCome on, you can use Basira’s cot. \nHELEN \nGood luck, Archivist. Be seeing you. \n[Tape clicks off.] \n[The Magnus Archives Theme – Outro] \nJONATHAN SIMS \nThe Magnus Archives is a podcast distributed by Rusty Quill and licenced under \na Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Sharealike 4.0 International \nLicence.
