Original statement given July \n2nd 2014. Audio recording by Jonathan Sims, Head Archivist of the Magnus \nInstitute, London. \nStatement begins. \nARCHIVIST (STATEMENT) \nPigs are tricky. They are very intelligent animals. But I’ve found I can never \ncompletely bring myself to trust them. They can be your best friend, then \ntackle your legs from behind if they’re feeling mean. And when a pig hits you, \n\nyou know you’ve been hit. It doesn’t help matters that I am acutely aware that \na pig would be more than happy to eat me if the opportunity came up. \nThey’re true omnivores, and they wouldn’t necessarily even do me the \ncourtesy of waiting until I was dead. I’ve heard more than one grisly story of a \nfarmer passing out drunk in a pigpen, and in the morning there’s only bones. I \nhad my cousin, Melinda, visiting a few years back with her son, and I told her \nto make sure and keep the baby away from the pigs. I still remember the \ndawning look of horror on her face when I told her why, like she couldn’t \nbelieve that a pig would just… eat a baby. But most pigs would. Most pigs will \neat just about anything that doesn’t stop them. \nI feel I may be doing pigs a disservice here, to be honest. When I say a pig can \nbe your best friend, I’m not exaggerating. They can be tremendously \naffectionate creatures, and I’ve known more than one pig that I’d put in the \nrunning against any of my human friends. But it’s hard to get past the idea that \nif my human friends would draw a cock and balls on my face when I’m sleeping \noff the drink, my pig friends might just… eat me. They probably wouldn’t. \n‘Cause we’re friends. But they might. \nIt’s not even like I run a proper pig farm, I just keep a few at a time, since \nthey’re quite handy to have about. A couple of pigs are a great way to dispose \nof waste, and their manure is great for composting. And, I can’t deny, when it’s \ntheir time, they are… quite tasty. And I do sell the meat, though I take a lot of \npains to make sure people know it was raised cruelty free. I take care of them. \nThe point is, I certainly have never had so many pigs that I would lose track. \nAnd I know I never bought or birthed the monster pig. \n\nWhen I first called it that, it was just because it was huge. I never got a chance \nto properly weigh it, but it must have come in at around three or four hundred \nkilos. I don’t know if you know about pigs, but that’s big. Bigger than big. It’s a \nmonster pig. I didn’t find out about the rest until... well, I didn’t know. \nI don’t know when it came from. I didn’t buy it. I didn’t take delivery of it, and \nas far as I can tell, no-one else did either. It’s a bit hard to tell as this was back \nin March, so the Merlot harvest season was well underway. As you’ve seen, \nwhile I do have a few pigs, this is a vineyard. We supply grapes to a lot of the \nbigger winemakers around here, and I’d been toying with the idea of starting \nmy own label but haven’t really done anything with it yet. Oh, uh, when you’re \nwriting this up, make it’s clear that we’re near the Marlborough Forest, but \nthat’s not the same thing as the Marlborough region, which is famous for wine. \nThat’s on the South Island. I just don’t want there to be any confusion. \nWhere was I? Yeah, it was the height of the Merlot harvest, so most of us, \nmyself included, were out in the vineyard for pretty much the whole day. I \nhadn’t checked on the pigs in a while, but the next time I headed into the sty… \nthere it was, sat in the corner, just encompassing the corner, its bulk filling the \nplace out as the other, smaller pigs, tried to find somewhere to be that wasn’t \nnext to it. It just sat there, and stared at me. I didn’t like staring back at it. It \nmade me feel strange, like it was sorting me into cuts of meat. There was more \nin those eyes than I’d ever seen in another pig; hidden among the rolls of pink \nflesh, they had malice in them. The pig wanted to hurt me. I’m sure of that. \nI-I didn’t know what to do. I just— I asked around to see if anyone knew where \nit had come from, but no-one had any idea. They were just as baffled as", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 0, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 4500}}
