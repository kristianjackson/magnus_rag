Tears flow, too, but no one notices, and no \none cares. Their punishment is at hand. \n[Rustles of undergrowth as the runners come to a stop; from \ndifferent directions, every so often a twig snaps from their \nmovement] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nIn moments, the prey is surrounded. The spaces between the trees are filled \nwith eyes that hate and hands that hold the promise of a life ended on the \nrotting leaves of the forest floor. They smile, and their teeth glint in the \nmoonlight, still red with all that remains of their last morsel of prey. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 176 – Blood Ties \n12 \nThey begin to step closer. One step. Two steps. When the prey turns, they are \nstill, but they surround in all directions, moving slowly when they are not being \nwatched. What's the time, Mr Wolf? The time to run is over. The time to suffer \nhas arrived. \nBut there is one last burst of strength within the prey. Not strength of arm, or \nspeed of escape — what good is fight-or-flight in this place? — but a strength \nof voice, of bitter, angry recrimination. Hurling accusations upon their \npursuers: hypocrites, bullies, pathetic wretches that would hound the innocent \nso. Perhaps the prey earnestly believes it, casts themself full woeful into the \nmould of victim, of one who has done no wrong. Or perhaps they feel within \nthemself the weight of the sin stinking out of them, flaring the hearts of their \npersecutors, but see in the faces that approach them those same \ntransgressions shining, reflected back upon them. It doesn't matter in the end, \nfor the cry is the same: \"This isn't fair. This isn't right.\" \n[Rustles as the pack moves; then there is ripping and \neating sounds] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nThe pack descends and the prey is silenced, protests cut short by teeth digging \ninto throat, nails piercing skin and clawing at gristle, bones shattering under \nrelentless, merciless blows. And the blood and bile flow freely, exciting the \npack to ever-greater raptures of cruelty, of pure and cleansing rage. They taste \ntheir fury in every corner of them. There is no sound to break their peace but \nthe wet ripping of flesh and the occasional transcendent scream of deserved \nagony. \n[The sounds of ripping and eating concludes] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 176 – Blood Ties \n13 \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nAnd then it is over. There is a moment, a single, holy moment of blessed \nabsolution, washed clean in sweet and sticky blood. And then the unease \nreturns. The uncertainty and fear that at some moments gripped them \nthroughout their pursuit. They look around from one to another, aware as they \nstand over the twitching remains, that they are suddenly without prey. \nExpressions sharpen, eyes narrow, growls begin to bubble up deep from within \neach chest. They are afraid. They can each smell it wafting from the others, but \nwho will it be? Who is the most afraid? Which of them held back? Which of \nthem… \n[A loud twig snap] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nThere. You. Blood on your hands, no doubt; blood on your lips; but not much. \nNot much at all. Perhaps you couldn't get close enough, there were so many \nhunters, after all. Or perhaps you stayed your hand out of mercy. Out of... \nsympathy. Perhaps you stink of that same sin. \nNo words need to be spoken, no accusations put in so coarse a form as voice. \nThe pack immediately knows which among them is no longer theirs, which has \nexposed their own inequity. Which is now prey. \n[Rustles of the undergrowth, then jagged breaths and running feet] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nThe prey turns and runs, all grace of the Hunt forgotten as they stumble, \ncrashing through undergrowth and dirt. \n[Hissing static starts] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 176 – Blood Ties \n14 \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nBehind them, feet pound silent. \n[Sounds of the pack fade away; the forest sounds continue, with \nthe birds of prey resuming their calls] \n(The Archivist exhales) \n[Hissing static ends] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \n(Calling) I'm done. \n(Beat) \n[Rustles as Martin walks back] \nARCHIVIST (CONT'D) \nYou alright? \nMARTIN \n(Snapping) Just peachy. (softening) I don't, I don't know; I feel like I saw \nsomething in the trees. \nARCHIVIST \nYou did. \nMARTIN \n(Sarcastic) Oh! Fantastic. You're very reassuring, you know that? \nIs it that… pack thing you were talking about?", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 3, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 4444}}
