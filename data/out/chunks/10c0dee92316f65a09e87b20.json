I \nalways used to think that level of caution was ridiculous, given our mozzies \ndidn’t actually have malaria. Not so much anymore. \nWe were trying to synthesise a sort of ‘blood substitute’, a combination of the \nsugars and proteins that the mozzies need to survive, but one that was more \nenticing than a human full of blood. The idea was to create a, a lure of sorts, \nwhich would keep the mosquitoes concentrated away from people, and could \npotentially be used to poison them, though that bit was some ways in the \nfuture. At this point most of the research was spent trying to perfect the ‘taste’ \nof the thing, for lack of a better term. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG045 – Blood Bag \n3 \n \nThe smell was also a big factor, as we needed the mozzies to choose it as a \nsource of protein over a human, and as it progressed, it turned out that the \ntexture and composition of the feeding bag itself helped attract them, so it \nended up getting more and more like, er… human skin. The later bags even had \nlittle bits of human hair embedded into them, which made the whole thing \nseveral shades too grotesque for me, but the mozzies went mad for it, and as \nfar as Neil was concerned, that’s all that mattered. \nAfter about six months we had pretty much perfected it, to be honest. We had \na lure bag that the mozzies preferred over a human sample in 98 per cent of \ncases, in which they consistently demonstrated a willingness to return to over \nalternatives. The issue was the cost. Our synthesised blood substitute, which \nwe liked to call ‘haemoglobish’, was simply not cheap enough for mass \nproduction, especially considering the bag requirements, and as we were \ndealing in prevention rather than cure, we were always going to be compared \nto the cost effectiveness of just buying a boatload of mosquito nets. And that \nwasn’t going to be a comparison where we came out on top. We kept going \nthough, trying to recreate the effect with cheaper, more easily available \nmaterials, but that was when Neil first started muttering darkly about funding. \nHere’s where I should probably say a bit about Neil’s syringe. Now, our Dr. \nThompson claimed to be descended from the 19th-century physician, John \nSnow, a great-great-nephew or a great-great-great-grandson, or something like \nthat. I’m not sure how much you know about epidemiology in the 1850s, and \nit’s certainly a common enough name, but Snow was pivotal in laying the \ngroundwork for the germ theory of disease transmission, and is widely \ncredited with helping end the cholera outbreak of 1854. I only bring this up \nbecause Neil had… well, I suppose you could call it something of a totem. It \nwas an old Victorian syringe, which he claimed had belonged to this illustrious \nancestor of his. \nI don’t know if it was true or not, but Neil certainly treated the thing like a relic. \nHe kept it in excellent condition, with glass shining and brass polished, and \nwould carry it around in a small case tucked into his lab coat pocket. Whenever \nhe was called upon to do any calculations or look over results, his hand would \nslip into that pocket, and he’d gently clutch that case.
