I sighed, \nrelieved at this discovery, which, from my perspective, was about the best \nresult I could have hoped for. I spent a minute or two taking pictures for Nicola \nand headed back towards the door. And that’s when everything started to go \nhorribly wrong. \nWhen I reached the doorway back into the shopfront, I took a second to glance \nthrough the window and I froze. In the entrance to the shop stood a huge, \nhulking silhouette. It reached to push it open and I staggered back into the \nroom, looking for another way out. There was only one other door, apparently \ninto the rest of the building, but it was firmly locked, and I didn’t have time to \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG049 – The Butcher’s Window \n9 \n \ntry and get through. Without any other options, I covered Hector back over \nwith the tarpaulin, opened one of the lockers and squeezed myself inside. \nLuckily for me, they were large and didn’t seem to have any shelves. I stepped \non something soft and, looking down, saw a rough pile of clothes at my feet. I \ndidn’t have time to consider this before I saw the door begin to open and I had \nto shut myself in. \nI stood there in the dark, trying not to make a sound, as I heard heavy footfalls \napproach and the door to the room slammed shut. From my position, I could \njust about see out through the vents in the locker and I very much hoped the \nhuge guy now strapping on an apron could not see in. He was immense, almost \nseven feet tall with thick limbs that looked like they’d been badly carved out of \nlumpy rock. Even his head was massive, but there, like everywhere his skin was \non show, it bulged slightly when he moved, hard bumps forming and stretching \nhis skin in odd places. Was this the ‘Jared’ mentioned in the note? He pulled \nback the tarpaulin covering Hector’s body and cracked his knuckles. I don’t \nthink I’ll ever forget the sound of him doing that. \nThen he reached into Hector. No cutting, no saws, he just reached in, and I \nrealised why the room was soundproofed. Because it turned out Hector wasn’t \ndead. And it was going to be a while before Jared got around to his lungs or \nthroat. Jared pulled out what appeared to be a handful of ribs. He considered \nthem for a few moments before he began to twist them like warm putty, \nmaking them into some sort of braid. He considered his handiwork silently, as \nHector lay screaming on the table, before he shook his head and walked \ntowards my locker. \nFor a terrible moment, I was sure he was going to wrench open the locker and \npull me out, but instead he grabbed a crowbar that had been resting against \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG049 – The Butcher’s Window \n10 \n \nthe wall and levered up one of the metal floor tiles. From where I was \nstanding, I could see there was a hole underneath that seemed to disappear \ndeep into the ground. There was something not right about that hole, the \ntexture of the walls was too smooth to be earth and it seemed to glisten, \nwetly. It was when I saw the teeth that studded the inside of the fleshy throat \nthat I realised what I was looking at and I choked back a scream. Jared \ncasually tossed the bones he had been twisting inside and they disappeared \ninto the dark opening without a sound. \nAnd so it went on for four gruelling hours. After the first, Hector wasn’t \nconscious enough to scream anymore, but Jared continued to bend and warp \nhim, occasionally pulling bits out and throwing them into the pit. Once I even \nsaw him take one of Hector’s femurs and, after twisting it into a corkscrew \nspiral, he reached into his own torso and left it there with a sigh of \ncontentment. \nAt last, Hector died, and I almost wept with relief. Jared sighed in what \nsounded like disappointment and then fetched the butcher tools from the wall. \nIt took him another half hour to fully dismember the corpse, tossing each piece \ninto the pit when it was small enough and hosing the blood down into it. He \nremoved his apron, walked to the chair and sat down. His movements were \nsluggish now, uncoordinated, almost like he was drunk. Once in the chair, his \nhuge frame slumped forward and his eyes closed. It looked like he was asleep. \nI should have waited longer, should have made sure he was fast asleep, but I \nwas close to breaking point at this stage and I could think of nothing but \nescape. I opened the locker and walked quickly, silently over to the door and \nopened it. As I did so, the gentle sounds of the street at ni", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 6, "chunk_count": 10, "chars": 4500}}
