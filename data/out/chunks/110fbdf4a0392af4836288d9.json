Tape clicks on.] \nARCHIVIST \nI, um… I… Right. Right, I— My head is... That was Michael. It-It was… It was \nMichael. H-how… How was it Michael? He— It... It never… Gertrude knew \nMichael. He was one of her assistants, but, but, but that doesn’t make any \nsense. \nThe thing that calls itself Michael, it-it-it doesn’t seem like it was ever human. \nSo what happened to the real Michael? Did— I mean that’s not really a \nquestion, is it? He’s dead, and it’s probably because of Gertrude. I still can’t \nfigure out whose side she was actually on. Or even if she was playing the same \ngame. Doesn’t matter. Everyone who came close to her… seems like it… it \n\nwent badly. Her assistants, Gerard, Leitner, Elias, though I don’t think Gertrude \nhad anything to do with his going rotten. But Michael... Did it take that form \njust to mock me? Knowing that at-at some point I’d look deeper into Gertrude? \nWHAT THE HELL ARE YOU? \nNo. No, never when you call. \nJust one door. So many of these stories, these, these people touched by... \nOnce you’re on the path to becoming a monst— an avatar, it looks like it gets \nmore and more unhealthy to be around you. (Heavy sigh) I think… I think I \nneed to lea— \n[Door opens] \nGEORGIE \nUh, John, did you call me? I was in the studio, but I thought I heard you \nshouting. \nARCHIVIST \nOh, uh, no it’s a false alarm. \nGEORGIE \nOkay, uh, sure. You alright? \nARCHIVIST \nYeah, I… Look, look, I've been thinking— \nGEORGIE \nAre you sure? You look a bit— \n\nARCHIVIST \nNo, I’m fine! \nGEORGIE \nNo, really, you’re really sweating. \nARCHIVIST \nLook, G-Georgie, I need to move out. \nGEORGIE \nUmm... yeah. I thought you were looking for a place. Y’know, now, now you’ve \ngot a salary again. \nARCHIVIST \nNo, I, I mean, now. \nGEORGIE \nWhat, now now? It’s like five in the afternoon. \nARCHIVIST \nT-Tomorrow, then. I… I-I just… I just don’t like staying here. \nGEORGIE \nWell thanks. \nARCHIVIST \nYou know that’s not what I mean. I feel like I’m putting you in danger. \n\nGEORGIE \nWell, yeah. You are. A horrible mannequin thing turned up. Had to change all \nmy lightbulbs. \nARCHIVIST \nYeah. This, this is my point! \nGEORGIE \nI said I’m fine with it. At least until you’re properly back on your feet. You’re \nnot doing well. You keep apologising and saying you're changing, but it's all just \nthe same. If you leave, I think it's just going to get worse, and I don't want that. \nARCHIVIST \nI do appreci— I mean, I don’t… Georgie, you literally can’t feel fear! Are you \nsure that that’s not— \nGEORGIE \nDon’t! Okay. I’m well aware of my situation. It does not make me an idiot. And \nit doesn’t mean I got a death wish, either. \nARCHIVIST \nIs it… Why are you so insistent on keeping me around? \nGEORGIE \nBecause you’re trying to cut yourself off, and that’s... that’s really bad. Look, \nwhen’s the last time you spoke to someone who wasn’t me? \nARCHIVIST \n\nThat’s… I… I-I- talked to Martin a…a, a few weeks ago... \nGEORGIE \nDid you talk to him? Or did he talk to you, while you tried to find a way to \nescape? \nARCHIVIST \nI… \nGEORGIE \nLook, you’re worried. I get it. But if you really think you’re turning into \nsomething... inhuman, you need people around you. You need anchors. \nARCHIVIST \nAll my “anchors” are just as deep in this as me. \nGEORGIE \nWell, you still need them. \nARCHIVIST \n(Sigh) Maybe you’re right. I’ll talk to the others. Check in properly, see if I can \nhelp with the, uh, with Elias’ new management style. But I won’t stay here. If \nsomething happened to you, or, or, god-forbid, the Admiral, because I was \nhere—. \nGEORGIE \nAlright, fine. I mean, you’re a grown-ass man, you want to leave, find a hotel, I \ncan’t stop you. Just... keep in touch, alright? Y’know, don’t be a ‘stranger’. \n\nARCHIVIST \nGeorgie. \nGEORGIE \nOh come on, that was classic Barker. \nARCHIVIST \nI’m just not in the mood. \n[Tape clicks off. Tape clicks on. There are sounds of a street.] \nBREEKON \n‘scuse us. \nHOPE \nAre you Jonathan Sims? \nARCHIVIST \nYeah, wh—? Oh, sh— \n[The Archivist exclaims & coughs as if punched.] \nBREEKON \nMiss Orsinov wants to see you. \nHOPE \nShe says she changed her mind. \nARCHIVIST", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 4, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 4158}}
