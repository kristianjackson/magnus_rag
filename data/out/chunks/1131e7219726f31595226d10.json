He was drinking on the sofa at the time, and he \nturned off the television as soon as I mentioned going into the darkroom. He \ndidn’t say a word as I told him what I’d seen, just looked at me with an \nexpression on his face I’d never seen before. When I was finished, he stood up \nand walked towards me, before taking me in his arms and giving me the last \nand longest hug I would ever get from him. He asked me not to hate him, and \ntold me it would soon be over, then turned to go. I had no idea what he was \ntalking about but, when I asked, he just said that I needed to stay in my room \nuntil he got back. Then he left. \nI did what I was told. I went up to my room and lay in bed, trying to sleep. The \nair was heavy somehow, and in the end I spent the night staring out of the \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG009 – A Father’s Love \n11 \n \nwindow at the street below. I was waiting for something, though I didn’t know \nwhat. \nI remember it was 2:47 in the morning that it started. I finally had an alarm \nclock and the image of it is still clear in my memory.

But not as far as \nthey should’ve gone. There were fewer lights than there should be, I was sure \nof it. Then I saw the light at the end of road blink off. There was no moon out \nthat night, and all the houses were quiet; when the streetlights stopped there \nwas nothing but black. The next closest streetlight failed. Then the next. And \nthe next. A slow, rolling blanket of darkness making its unhurried way towards \nme. The few lights still on in the houses along the road also disappeared as the \ntide approached. I just sat there, unable to look away. Finally, it reached our \nhouse, and all at once the lights were gone and the darkness was inside. I \nheard a knock on the front door. Firm, unhurried and insistent. Silence. I did \nnot move. The knocking came again, harder this time, and I heard the door \nrattle on its hinges. As it got louder it began to sound less and less like a person \nknocking and more like… wet meat being slammed the study wood of the front \ndoor. \nI turned and ran towards the phone.
