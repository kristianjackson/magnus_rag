He went full-on Sweeny Todd. \nNow, the thing is, I live just off Higham Hill Road, and I used to go to that \ntakeaway all the time. I definitely went there a few times in May 2004. I \nhaven’t been able to find out from any of the news reports exactly what he \nwas selling the meat as, but over the course of the month I definitely had \nchicken wings, doner kebab, chicken kebab and a burger, so there’s a very \ngood chance I ate some of her. It’s weird, though, everything I’ve found online \nsays that human meat is meant to be very similar to pork, but nothing I was \n\nserved was like that. I mean, pork is pretty different from beef or lamb or \nchicken, and I can’t see how it was being easily passed off as any of them. But \nhe must have managed it somehow. Maybe the doner? It was so heavily spiced \nit would have disguised the flavour, I guess. I don’t know how he would have \nmade it look like doner meat, though. It’s very distinctive and I was always \nunder the impression that you needed to order those huge rotating columns of \nthings specially. \nRegardless, the fact of the matter is that I am almost certainly a cannibal. You \nknow the weirdest part, though? The bit I regret most is that I don’t know \nwhich of the meals it was. I feel like, if I’ve been tricked into eating a person, I \nmight at least have learned what a human being tastes like. And I don’t really \nhave a problem with the idea, in any sort of moral sense, at least. I know how \nthat sounds, and I’m certainly not okay with murder, not to mention the issue \nwith prion diseases, but the actual act of eating meat that comes from a \nhuman? I’m fine with it. I can’t help but feel that anyone happy to eat other \nmeats is something of a hypocrite if they’re not at least theoretically fine with \neating human. \nThere’s nothing inherently special about us. We feel as much pain, see the \nworld with the same eyes as a real pig. Meat is meat. That’s what John Haan \nsaid when they arrested him. The only thing he said. \nMeat is meat. \nNone of this really changes anything. Whether or not I’ve eaten chicken wing \nmade of person doesn’t actually factor into this, I guess, except that it’s the \nreason I always kept an eye on the old takeaway. \n\nAfter John Haan was arrested, it was never sold on. Not surprising. It’s the sort \nof history that people tend not to want in their property investments. I didn’t \nmove away, though. I kept right on living there, and walked past the old \nboarded-up shop almost every day. As far as I’m aware it never actually had a \nname. I mean, it must have, but it wasn’t clear from the front. Over the door \nwas a large, hand-painted sign that simply read ‘FOOD’ in bright white capital \nletters, while a neon sign that protruded from it glowed with the word ‘GRILL’ \non both sides in bright red. As the months of its closure started to turn into \nyears, the old green paint on the window panes gradually started to fade and \nthe large metal sheets that covered the windows and door were almost lost \nbeneath a sea of posters and flyers advertising club nights and escorts. \nSometimes, if the light hit it just right, I could lean in and see inside through \nthe tiny holes in the steel. I could see the bright shine of the fryer, the glass of \nthe heating drawer, the tall column of metal that would have rotated the \nkebab. It all seemed somehow too clean for it to be so abandoned, and I was \nsure I could even see the vivid colours of soft drink cans in the clear-fronted \nfridge. \nIt was a grey, dull afternoon when I heard it. There was a miserable rain; the \nsort that doesn’t even fall, it just seems to hang in the air, speckling your face \nwith a fine, soaking mist. There wasn’t a single patch of sky that disrupted the \nuniform gloom as I walked past the old takeaway. I stopped for a second, \nstaring at the broken old building as I so often did, when I heard a sound from \ninside. It wasn’t a loud sound, like something small and light falling to the floor. \nI went closer, listening, but the sound didn’t come again. Leaning in, I tried to \nsee through to the inside of the building, but the overcast day didn’t give \nenough light to see by. I stood up, trying to convince myself that I had", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 1, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 4346}}
