Original statement written 9th November 2014. \nAudio recording by Jonathan Sims, the Archivist. \nStatement begins. \nARCHIVIST (STATEMENT) \nLife is hard. I don’t want to bum you out or anything, but yeah. You’re all \nalone, trying to connect with people, trying to find your place in the world, but \nin the end the only person you really know is yourself, and even then, not all \nthat well. There’s plenty of things I’ve done I couldn’t explain to you. I mean, \nI’m constantly, constantly looking back at my past self and thinking, “What an \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 150 – Cul-de-Sac \n \n2 \n \nidiot! How the hell could he have done such an obviously stupid thing? How \nwas I surprised it went so badly? What a relief I’m now so much older and \nwiser.” Except that last part never really turns out to be true, does it? The line \nof when you were your dumb younger self seems to keep moving forward with \nyou, until each more mature and reasonable version of you eventually falls foul \nof it and becomes a young idiot. \nAnd when you add in another person, you reach a whole other level. You can \nlove them, marry them, dedicate your life to them, but that’s not the same as \nactually understanding them. I was with Alberto for fifteen years, and I tell you \nwhat, I could always anticipate him. He always used to get annoyed at how \npredictable I found his mood sometimes, but damn if I ever really knew why. \nOf course, it doesn’t help that when you’re that close to someone everything \nstarts to reflect on each other, one bad mood feeds into another and stress \njust bounces back and forth between you. It can get real bad if you’re not \ncareful. And we weren’t careful. \nThe thing is, when we both found ourselves in positions to be working from \nhome, we actually thought it was going to be really good for our relationship. \nThe two of us, spending all our time together; we reckoned it was going to be \nreal romantic. We were real stupid back then. And when Alberto’s parents \noffered to sell us their second home in Cheadle, we thought it was a great \ninvestment: nice and quiet, good neighbourhood, just a real nice home for the \ntwo of us, and so much bigger than anything we could afford in the city. And \nbefore you think Cheadle the suburb of Manchester, that’s not the one I’m \ntalking about. I’m talking about Cheadle, the suburb of Stoke-on-Trent. Hell, \ntechnically it’s not even a suburb. It’s just a village that looks so much like a \nsuburb that you could pull it up drop it on the edge of any dull town in England", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 0, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 2927}}
