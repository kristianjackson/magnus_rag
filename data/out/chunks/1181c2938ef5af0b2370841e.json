I gripped the handle so tight I \nwas sure it would snap off in my fingers. Finally, I stood before the spider, \npreparing myself to calmly crush it against the wall. Then it moved without \nwarning and I hurled the mug against the wall with all my might. \nIt hit the spider dead on and exploded in a shower of coffee and china. I stood \nthere for a minute, breathing hard, but all that remained was a large stain on \nthe wall and mug shards littering the floor. I should have cleaned it up \nimmediately, but I was so tired, as though killing the spider had taken every \nounce of wakefulness that I had within me. I simply turned around and went to \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG016 – Arachnophobia \n6 \n \nbed. My dreams that night were many-legged but there’s not much unusual in \nthat. \nI spent the next morning cleaning up the detritus from my battle with the \nspider. I wished that I had gotten the coffee cleaned before it had dried, but by \nlunchtime the place was looking very much as it had before. As I swept up the \nsmashed mug, I noticed that the largest shard, emblazoned with the design of \na stylized blue owl, had a vivid smear on it. Brown, red and green were crushed \nonto it where it had hit the spider. It disgusted me, but looking at it I couldn’t \nhelp but feel a small surge of triumph, and I smiled as I threw it into the \ngarbage bag. Major Tom watched, impassive as always. \nThe next few days passed without incident. Major Tom had never been much \nof an indoor cat, so I had installed a cat flap some time before to allow him to \ncome and go as he pleased. After that first encounter he seemed to spend \nmore time outside, and I saw him less and less as the week progressed. I didn’t \nthink much of it; we’d had a particularly mild Christmas, so it made sense that \nhe’d be enjoying the outside as much as possible before winter really set in.7 \nIt was the Friday after my first encounter that it happened. I came in from \nwork, tired after a difficult week – I used to work as a data analyst at an online \nbetting company – and decided to order takeout and relax in front of some TV. \nI eased myself back into my armchair and reached for the remote. I was aware \nthat Major Tom wasn’t anywhere to be seen, which was odd, since he usually \ngot fed shortly after I arrived home and he was never one to miss a meal. Still, I \ndidn’t think of it, and turned on the television. I hadn’t turned the satellite box, \nso what showed at first was an empty blue screen. I reached to the other \nremote to turn it on, when I realised the blue screen wasn’t empty. There, sat \nupon it, black against the glowing background, was a spider.
