Episode one hundred and forty-\nthree. Heart of Darkness. \n[Tape clicks on. A door opens and a torch is switched on.] \nBASIRA \nYou’re sure it’s this one? \nARCHIVIST \nYeah. Tape recorder thinks so too. \nBASIRA \nRight. Something’s coming then? \nARCHIVIST \nCould be. \nBASIRA \nNo windows. Guess that makes sense. We still alone? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 143 – Heart of Darkness \n \n2 \n \nARCHIVIST \nI never said we were. Just said I couldn’t see anybody. \nBASIRA \nOh, I thought you meant, like, see see. \nARCHIVIST \nUh, no. \nBASIRA \nWe need to figure out proper terms for this stu— What are you doing? \nARCHIVIST \nClosing the door? \nBASIRA \nLeave it open. We want as much light as possible, and I’m not seeing any bulbs. \nARCHIVIST \nRight. \n[A second torch is switched on.] \nBASIRA \nEyes peeled. \nARCHIVIST \nWas that a joke? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 143 – Heart of Darkness \n \n3 \n \nBASIRA \nYeah. \nAny clue where everyone is? \nARCHIVIST \nYour guess is as good as mine. \nBASIRA \nWell, my guess is an ambush. \nARCHIVIST \nI don’t know. Everyone back at the research base seemed pretty sure this place \nwas empty. \nBASIRA \nAnd you believe them? \nARCHIVIST \nThey weren’t lying. \nBASIRA \nWait, you did your … \nARCHIVIST \nOh, yeah, I don’t think they noticed. \nBASIRA \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 143 – Heart of Darkness \n \n4 \n \nSo they were serious? It’s been empty for, what, a year? \nARCHIVIST \nBit more. As far as they knew, anyway. \nBASIRA \nSo what? This was another waste of time? No church. No Dark Sun. I’m going \nto kill that son of a bitch. \nARCHIVIST \nNo, I … I think it’s here. I can feel it, like a hole in my mind. \nBASIRA \nThey just left it here? \nARCHIVIST \nI ... Maybe. Kind of wish Daisy was here. \n… \nBasira? \nBASIRA \nYeah. \nARCHIVIST \nSorry, I know this isn’t— Behind you! \nBASIRA \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 143 – Heart of Darkness \n \n5 \n \nDown! \n[A gun is fired, glass shatters, followed by a scream and a thud] \nMANUELA \nAh! \nBASIRA \nDon’t move! \n(Manuela spits at Basira.) \nARCHIVIST \nOh, charming. \nBASIRA \nWho are you? \n(Manuela snarls at Basira.) \nJohn? \nARCHIVIST \n(Compelling) Who are you? \nMANUELA \n(Pained) Manuela. Manuela Dominguez. \nBASIRA \nWhere is everybody? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 143 – Heart of Darkness \n \n6 \n \nMANUELA \nGo to hell. \nARCHIVIST \n(Compelling) Answer her. \nMANUELA \nThey’re dead, because of you. \nARCHIVIST \nMe? \nBASIRA \nWhat did you do? \nARCHIVIST \nNothing, I don’t think! \nMANUELA \nYour Institute. So, she sent you to finish the job? \nBASIRA \nWho? \nMANUELA \nYour Archivist, Gertrude Robinson. \nARCHIVIST \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 143 – Heart of Darkness \n \n7 \n \nGertrude? \nBASIRA \nThis doesn’t make sense. \nARCHIVIST \n(Compelling) What happened? \nMANUELA \nDon’t ... Don’t make me. Please. \nARCHIVIST \n(Compelling) Tell me. \nMANUELA (STATEMENT) \nFine … And what do you wish to hear? Shall I tell you of the decades of \npreparation, the long wait for the eclipse, three hundred years from the failure \nthat birthed the thing that preached from the depths of Maxwell Rayner? The \nsacrifices made to birth the dark star that would make it all possible? It was to \nbe a week of night and horror, culminating in the eclipse that passed over Ny-\nÅlesund on the 20th March 2015, almost 300 years after Halley’s eclipse \npassed over London. We had hundreds of sacrifices prepared and ready, \nplunged into darkness and terror for days on end, all prepared to culminate in \nthe unveiling of that point of purest night at the moment of the eclipse’s \nheight. It would open the door to a world of true and holy darkness, extinguish \nthe sun and take us to a place where we would be redeemed of our base and \ncorrupt need for light and warmth.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 0, "chunk_count": 5, "chars": 3887}}
