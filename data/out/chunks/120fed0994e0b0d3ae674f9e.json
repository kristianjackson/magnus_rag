I asked her again to take me to the \ndrain, and she made a rather odd noise, and led me inside. \nWe walked through the main floor of the workshop, with people bustling \nabout either side, doing whatever it was they were doing. My mind was \nfocused on the job at hand. Megan took me into a back room full of pipes and \ngratings, and pointed to a drain in the centre of the floor where dark water \nwas pooling out of the top. You’d have thought the dark red would have clued \nme in to what was happening but, honestly, there are all sorts of industrial \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG087 – The Uncanny Valley \n6 \n \nchemicals that turn water that colour, so it didn’t really register as worrying. \nSo, I pulled up the grate, and got to work. \nAll through it, Megan was chatting with me quietly. She was whispering, \nmaking it a bit hard to hear her over the noise from the main building, so I \nmostly just nodded and made the appropriate sounds of interest. And I \nthought she was talking about her hobbies. After all, I’d never actually heard \nthe term ‘flensing’ before, and the way she was talking about it I assumed it \nwas some sort of a sculpture. I mean, you meet all sorts of strange people in \nmy line of work, and I pride myself on being able to keep up a gentle \nconversation with all of them. I have, of course, since looked up flensing, and \nthat certainly throws a lot of that conversation into a very different light \nindeed. I don’t think she was offering to do a sculpture of me. \nAnyway, soon enough I’d found the blockage: a big old wad of hardened fat \nand oil that had congealed at one of the bends, and removed it for them. It \nwasn’t nearly as big a job as I’d been afraid it might have been, and I talked \nMegan through my invoicing procedure as we walked back through the \nworkshop floor. \nShe was silent as I left, and seemed as though she was trying to get over some \nsort of shock. I guessed that she’d come over a bit queasy when I’d pulled out \nthe blockage, and was embarrassed to admit it. It’s a common enough thing: \nthe sight of the sort of mess that builds up in drainpipes can really get to you if \nyou’re not used to it. Anyway, I decided not to mention anything, just handed \nher my details, and told her I’d be in touch about payment. Then I hopped back \ninto my van and drove away. Job done. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG087 – The Uncanny Valley \n7 \n \nAt least, I had assumed it was job done. I wish, I very much wish, that it had \nbeen job done. It was the next day that the phone rang, about midday, and the \nnow-familiar voice of Megan asked me to come back. She said that they were \nhaving the same problem, but with a different drain. This struck me as a little \nbit odd, since I’d been pretty sure a building like that would only have one \ncentral drain, which I had already sorted out. \nStill, there was no harm in going to have a look, I told myself. After all, they \nclearly didn’t know anything about plumbing over there, and if I took good care \nof them I might have gotten myself a nice supply of repeat business. So once \nagain I packed up my truck, and started the drive. \nIt was the most infuriating thing. Even in the daylight, having been there once \nalready, finding the little valley proved remarkably difficult. I’d set out in good \ntime, but it was still getting well into the afternoon when I finally pulled up into \nthe small, dirt clearing. \nI hopped out to a sight that, in the daylight, even I noticed was deeply odd: \nMegan was stood there, waving a greeting at me, dressed in some sort of \nbright, blue and red costume, like a jester or a clown. Had she been wearing \nthat the night before? Surely not. Although, I suppose I didn’t really look at her \nclothes. Sat on a folding chair next to her was a squat, thickly muscled woman \nwith close-cropped black hair, who stared at me with a really vicious-looking \nsmirk. She exchanged a glance with Megan, who just nodded at her, and then \nshe burst into cruel laughter, and I was suddenly feeling very uncomfortable. \nI just stood there, toolbox in hand, debating whether or not to turn around and \ndrive away. I had just about decided to leave when I felt Megan’s hand grip my \nwrist. I hadn’t noticed her moving towards me.
