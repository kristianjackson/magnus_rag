It looked like an older woman, a widow I \nassumed, from the way it dressed in black and had a strange manner, which I \nnow know to be the mark of the vampire, but back then I paid no attention to \nit. Many of the older folks had lived through both wars and it was not \nuncommon for them to be somewhat strange. I thought this was the case with \nSylvia McDonald and after a small amount of discussion my brother and I \nagreed to the offer of food and shelter. \nLet me say a little bit about the vampire’s manner, because once I taught \nmyself to read I read as much on the subject as I could and it isn’t covered \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG010 – Vampire Killer \n4 \n \noften or clearly in those books I have found. You see, from my own \nobservations I believe a vampire to be more like an animal than a man. That is \nnot to be taken as merely a turn of phrase but more to do with how they work. \nI do not believe vampires are human in anything more than their appearance, \nnor have I ever seen evidence that they create more of their kind through \nfeeding. One thing that should be noted is that they do not speak. In fact they \nare in my experience totally silent, having no need for air and no room in their \nthroats for a windpipe. They are able to make themselves understood, \nhowever, with absolute clarity, though the manner through which they do so \nhas never been clear to me. When Sylvia McDonald came to us in the alleyway \nthat day, we understood that was the name it gave itself and that we were \nbeing offered a meal and a bed, even though it never uttered a single sound. \nMore than that, I do not recall the fact that it never said a word as striking \neither of us as strange in the slightest. I have never fully understood how they \nare able to do this, and I doubt that I ever shall, but I can only assume it to be \nsome instinctive form of hypnosis or mind control. \nAnother misconception I have always faced when trying to discuss vampires is \nthat people think they cannot go out during the day. They can. While I have \nwitnessed them avoid direct sunlight if possible and wear generally more \ncovering clothes when moving around during the daytime, they seem to have \nno significant problem doing so. I would describe them as weaker during the \nday, but whether this is scientifically due to the sunlight or simply because evil \nhas less power in the daylight hours is unclear to me. Sylvia McDonald came to \nus on an overcast afternoon and enough of its pale flesh was uncovered that, \nwere sunlight to truly harm a vampire, then it would likely have been \ndestroyed. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG010 – Vampire Killer \n5 \n \nOn that afternoon my brother Nigel and I agreed to go back to the house of \nSylvia McDonald in the hopes of a roof over our heads for a little while. She \nlived on Loom Street, which is still there, though the house itself was torn \ndown long ago and there’s just a bit of scrubland now where it used to be. I \nsometimes go there to pay my respects, since my brother has no burial or \ngrave I can visit. The house was old, even when I went there in 1959, and \nentering it I was hit by a stale, coppery smell that I did not recognise as old \nblood at the time, since I was barely 16 and did not have then the experience I \nhave now. The furniture and wallpaper had clearly not been changed in many \ndecades and a thick layer of dust covered everything. Even the floor was pale \nwith dust except for a stark line where Sylvia McDonald moved, the train of its \ndress dragging behind it. I remember wondering whether Sylvia McDonald \nwalked exactly the same route through the house always, as I saw other clear \nlines of passage in the rooms we passed through. None of the furniture looked \nused and when I picked up a book from one of the shelves the pages were solid \nwith damp and mould. I began to feel very uneasy at this point, but whatever \npowers of persuasion the vampire had calmed me enough to continue \nfollowing it with my brother. \nWe went up the stairs and I was led to a small room with a bed in it. I was \nmade to understand that this would be my room and was left there as Sylvia \nMcDonald led my brother away to the room next to it. When it returned it \nbrought a bowl of fruit and offered it to me. The fruit was clearly a few weeks \nold and in various stages of rotting, but just to appease the thing I found an \napple and a couple of grapes that seemed", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 2, "chunk_count": 10, "chars": 4499}}
