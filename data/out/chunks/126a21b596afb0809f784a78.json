Committed to tape 4th October 2013. Gertrude Robinson \nrecording. \n \nGERTRUDE (STATEMENT) \nSome months have passed now since the sights and sounds that excited in me \nthat unknown and hideous mania, yet still my hand shakes in the writing of it, \nsuch that I can scarce understand myself the marks I leave upon the page. I \nwould hold myself the most ill-used of men, were I not certain of others who \nleft that theatre with wounds far graver than a tremor. I curse the name of \nWolfgang von Kempelen and all his vile machinery, and there is no greater \nhope within me than that I should never again be required to lay eyes upon the \nMechanical Turk. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG116 – The Show Must Go On \n \n5 \n \n \nI have always refrained from writing of it, but some years ago, at its creation, \nKempelen prevailed upon me to play the Turk myself. I agreed, considering it a \ngrand old joke and a worthy use of my aptitude for chess. And some aptitude I \nhad indeed: in my youth I even played a match against Philidor himself in Old \nSlaughter’s coffee shop, though he thrashed me soundly. Most who would \ndismiss the Turk as a simple ruse or deception would posit that only a child \ncould have crawled inside the base of it, but at almost half a century I was \nquite delighted to work my way between the gears and play the venerable \npuppet master to Wolfgang’s infamous chess-playing automaton. \n \nMost who would discover that a human mind directed the Turk found that fact \ncause enough to dismiss the marvel of the thing, but to do so would have been \na grave disservice to Kempelen’s singular skill. For though I may have chosen \nthe movements and played the game that unfolded above my head, the \nmotions of the machine were the result of an ingenious array of gears and \nmechanisms that I could never hope to understand. It was an astounding feat \nof engineering, even if the mind behind it could not be replicated by clockwork \nand springs. At least, not when it was first constructed. \n \nI must not, however, allow my regard for Wolfgang’s intellect to distort the \nmost appalling horror that his creations precipitated upon that stage, nor to \nhide his complicity and guilt in what occurred. He was a strange man. For as \nlong as I knew him his manner caused me disquiet, and I attribute the \ncontinuation of our acquaintance in no small part to our difference in \nlanguage. We had some commonality in French, but I often felt there to be \nmuch nuance in his words that was simply not conveyed between two men, \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG116 – The Show Must Go On \n \n6 \n \nneither of whom were speaking his mother tongue. Indeed, on some few \noccasions when I observed him conversing in Hungarian or German, the \nexpressions I observed upon the faces of his interlocutors were invariably \nthose of discomfort or alarm. Wolfgang von Kempelen had within him some \nstrange dream, I think, some secret ambition that might be glimpsed when his \neye fell upon his automata, but it always eluded me. \n \nOur initial meeting was civil, even pleasant. He had by then completed his \nconstruction of the Turk, and had requested several of his compatriots to seek \nout those who might have some small skill at the game of chess. I was at the \ntime travelling in Austria, and introductions were made by a mutual \nacquaintance by the name of Langthorne. Wolfgang explained to me the \nconcept, that I would be secreted within the base of the machine and direct \nthe figure on how to play the game taking place upon the table. I agreed \nalmost immediately. Perhaps I would have had more reservations had I known \nthe unveiling would take place before the Empress Maria Theresa. Or if, when I \nagreed, I had actually laid my eyes upon the Mechanical Turk. \n \nWhat description of it should I give? Should I speak of its costume, the rich \nOttoman colours lined with fine fur? Or the dreadful stillness of its dark, \nshining face? The unmoving, painted eyes that met mine and could not see me \nrecoil? The torso simply ended as it disappeared below the table, and when I \nheld my nerve enough to climb into the tiny chamber below it, some small part \nof my soul cried out that I was devoured within the belly of the cruel device. \n \nDespite this, our exhibition to the Empress was a triumph, and I retreated from \nit both elated and utterly unsuspected.
