I didn’t! I’ve been thinking for a long time about \nwhat to do when… well, y’know, this happens. \nJONATHAN SIMS \n Well... thank you. \nSASHA \n That’s why we’re here? \nMARTIN \n Yeah. The room’s sealed, I checked it myself when I moved in. \n JONATHAN SIMS \n Climate controlled, as well. Strong door. Soundproof. [Sigh] These old files are far better protected \nthan we ever were. Alright, I’ll grant you it’s a good place to lay low, but— \nSASHA \n They could still come in through the air con. \nJONATHAN SIMS \n Not easily. And… not en masse. It is actually safe. \nMARTIN \n Ha! \nJONATHAN SIMS \n Except, of course, that we’re trapped. \nMARTIN \n Ah… yeah. Sorry. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG039 – Infestation \n5 \n \nSASHA \n Why record it? \nJONATHAN SIMS \n What? \nSASHA \n Before, in the office. It, it was stupid going for the tape recorder like that, and then when you \ndropped it out there… \nJONATHAN SIMS \n I said I was sorry. If I’d known Martin had another one stashed in here, I never would have… \nSASHA \n No, it’s, it’s fine, just... I just don’t understand. I thought you hated the damn thing. You’re always \ngoing on about it. \nJONATHAN SIMS \n I do! I did. I just... I don’t want to become a mystery. I refuse to become another goddamn mystery. \nSASHA \n What? \nJONATHAN SIMS \n Look, even if you ignore the walking soil-sack out there, and the fact that we are probably minutes \nfrom death, there is still so much more happening here. \nMARTIN \n I’m not sure we can really ignore the— \nJONATHAN SIMS \n Every real statement just leads… deeper into something I don’t even know the shape of yet. And to \ntop it all, I still don’t know what happened to Gertrude. Officially she’s still missing, but Elias is no \nhelp and the police were pretty clear that the wait to call her dead is just a formality. If I die, \nwormfood or... something else, whatever, I’m going to make damn sure the same doesn’t happen to \nme. Whoever takes over from me is going to know exactly what happened. \nSASHA \n You don’t think that would... put them off? \nJONATHAN SIMS \n [Bitter laugh] I hope so. Only an idiot would stay in this job. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG039 – Infestation \n6 \n \nMARTIN \n [Chuckles] Wouldn’t that make you an idiot? \nJONATHAN SIMS \n Yes, Martin, that was my point. \nSASHA \n Can you see what’s going on out there? \nMARTIN \n Ish. When did we last clean these doors? \nJONATHAN SIMS \n What can you see? \nMARTIN \n Worms seem to have backed off a bit. There’s a few lurking in the corners. Ooh, ooh hey, there’s the \nother tape recorder! \nSASHA \n Any sign of Prentiss? \nMARTIN \n No. No, it looks like they’re... waiting, I think. \nJONATHAN SIMS \n For what? \nMARTIN \n I don’t know. Tim, maybe? \nSASHA \n Oh god! \nMARTIN \n I think he was out at lunch. \nSASHA \n Quick, someone call him. Tell him not to come back inside. \nJONATHAN SIMS \n There’s no signal in here. We just have to hope he heard the noise. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG039 – Infestation \n7 \n \nSASHA \n John, what did you mean by “real statements”? \nJONATHAN SIMS \n You know what I mean. The ones that have weird wrinkles, or that just seem to have something \nsolid to them. They all have one thing in common. \nSASHA \n They don’t record digitally. \nJONATHAN SIMS \n And we have to use the tape recorder. At this stage, if it records to my laptop I almost don’t bother. \nI don’t— MARTIN \n There! There, there, there! I see him! \nJONATHAN SIMS \n What? \nMARTIN \n Tim. Tim’s outside. \nSASHA \n Oh god, he doesn’t know. He doesn’t see them. \nSASHA AND MARTIN \n (Calling out for Tim) \nTim, look out. \nJONATHAN SIMS \n It’s soundproofed. He can’t hear you! \nSASHA \n What is he doing? No, Tim, just run! Leave it alone! \nMARTIN \n Oh no, no, no, no… \nSASHA \n Turn around. Just turn around. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG039 – Infestation \n8 \n \nMARTIN \n Oh god. There she is, there she is. \nJONATHAN SIMS \n There’s nothing we can do. \nSASHA \n Ah, screw this. \nJONATHAN SIMS \n What, Sasha, NO! \n[DOOR OPENS] \nSASHA \n Tim, look out! \nJONATHAN SIMS \n Watch out for the tape… \n[CLICK] \n[CLICK] \nTIM \nstill working? Ah, okay. Test, test. What are you doing on the floor? Huh. [Imitates Archivist voice] \nStatement of Joe Spooky, regarding sinister happenings in the downtown old… \n[DOOR OPENS] \nSASHA \n Tim, look out! \n[WORM SOUNDS INTENSIFY] \nTIM \nSasha? \nSASHA \n Behind you!
