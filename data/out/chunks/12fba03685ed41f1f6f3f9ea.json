Tried to \nhave me put away, but they, um… they let me come here. It’s – it’s been good \nfor me though I feel alright. I’m – I’m not scared anymore. \nGEORGIE \nMelanie, you don’t have to do this. \nMELANIE \nIt’s – it’s okay. He’s welcome… as a friend. But that’s it. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 157 – Rotten Core \nARCHIVIST \nRight. \nMELANIE \nBut you’re not after a friend, are you, John? \nARCHIVIST \nI need an ally. \nMELANIE \nThen I can’t help you. \nARCHIVIST \nI suppose not. \n[The Admiral meows.] \nGEORGIE \nOkay. You’re done? \nARCHIVIST \nYeah. (Sigh) Yeah, I am. \nGEORGIE \nCome on, Melanie. Let’s get you back to bed. \nARCHIVIST \nLook after yourself. Both of you. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 157 – Rotten Core \nMELANIE \nYou too. Good luck, I guess. \nARCHIVIST \nThanks. \n[The door closes. Tape clicks off. Tape clicks on. There’s a loud, persistent \nknock on a very different door. It opens, creaking.] \nARCHIVIST \nHelen. \nHELEN \nJonathan. \nARCHIVIST \n(Determinedly) I need – you said before you knew the tunnels, right? That \nyou’d been a… part of them? \nHELEN \nNot my exact words, but close enough. \nARCHIVIST \nI need to know what’s in there. What’s at the center? I-it’s important, Martin – \nI need to know. \nHELEN \n(Gleeful) That’s a shame, because I’m afraid I’m not going to tell you! \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 157 – Rotten Core \nARCHIVIST \nWhat? Why not? \nHELEN \nBecause I have a good enough sense of what’s going on to know that it will be \nmuch more fun without my involvement! (The end of her words are almost \nlost as she laughs.) \n[The laugh echoes slightly.] \nARCHIVIST \nWhat? You – you said you were going to help! \nHELEN \nI am. \nARCHIVIST \nI don’t have time for this. (Compellingly) What is at the cen– \n[Something changes. There’s a high, unsettling metallic sound and the sound \nof a knife (or something like a knife). Helen is threatening The Archivist.] \nHELEN \n(Threateningly.) No. We’re not playing your game. Now don’t forget how \nsharp I can be, Archivist. Perhaps here, now, you’re powerful enough to learn \nwhat you want from me, but if you try, I promise you I will resist. And only one \nof us is going to survive the attempt. \n[The knife is removed.] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 157 – Rotten Core \nARCHIVIST \n(Breathing heavily) Fine. Can you take me there? To the center? \nHELEN \nI honestly don’t know. But I’m not inclined to risk it. \nARCHIVIST \nDamn you! \nHELEN \nRun home, John. Find a victim on the way. Chaos is coming and I think you’d \nbest be ready. \nARCHIVIST \nJust tell me what’s going on. Please. \nHELEN \nBad things, Archivist. Really bad things. \n[Helen’s laughs echo as her door swings shut.
