See if I can find any way in through any of the \nbits that used to be the Institute. \nARCHIVIST \nJust be careful, okay? \nMARTIN \nYeah, alright. Don’t worry about me. \nBesides if anything happens… least there’s plenty of witnesses. \nARCHIVIST \nThat’s not funny. \nMARTIN \nNo. \n(Martin sighs) \nBe back soon. \n[Brisk footsteps as Martin walks away] \n[two spotlights ka-chonk on] \nARCHIVIST \nRight, here’s your bloody performance... \n[Hissing static starts] \n[The Panopticon exterior is replaced with the urban sounds of a \ndistant car alarm, helicopters and traffic; camera iris movements \nare also heard] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 189 – Peers \n \n12 \n[Footsteps on pavement] \n[Hissing static ends] \nARCHIVIST \nThe minister hurries onwards, his eyes downcast, focusing on anything that \nbreaks the monotony of the street. Cracks in the paving stones, boot-stomped \ncigarette ends, the mouldering yellow lines that snake along the pavement’s \nedge. Anything so that he doesn’t have to meet their gaze. \n[Faint sounds of coughing, shuffling and crying people starts] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nThe gaunt and hollow-cheeked figures that stare at him from every corner of \nthis blighted city that might hide them from the chill. Stick-brittle women, \ndresses covered in second-hand blood; old men bloated from what we sold to \nthem as food, skin discoloured from malnourishment; and the children. God, \nthe children. \n[Distant sound of Big Ben tolling] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nThey won’t stop looking, won’t stop following him with their piteous, \ndesperate gaze that speaks so loudly his knees feel like they will buckle. ‘Help \nus.’ \nHe will. Of course he will. He wants to. He hasn’t lied to them, he really hasn’t. \nHe used to be one of them, he remembers what it can be like. He is there to \nspeak for them. And if necessary, he will join them again. The minister grips his \nblack leather briefcase closely to his chest, bile rising in his throat at the \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 189 – Peers \n \n13 \nsudden jolt of fear that races through his veins. Where did that come from? Is \nhe afraid of it, of returning, of that sharp stab of hunger, the shivering of a cold \nthat you can’t escape? Or is he afraid that, should it come to that, they will see \nhim as a deceiver? \nBut he cannot dwell solely on his worries, he tells himself – a sentiment that \nhis journey is proving quite inaccurate. He glances at his watch, trying to hide it \nfrom his observers so that they might not see how expensive it is. \n[The sounds of coughing, wailing and crying people intensifies] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nHe’s late, of course. The minister is always late. There are never any taxis, you \nsee. If he was in a car, it would be alright. Then he wouldn’t have to see them, \nbe seen by them. No, that’s not the way to look at it. These are his people, it’s \nimportant he stays connected to them. So why does it make him so afraid? \nBefore him rises the great shining glass palace, jagged and angular, clear crystal \nfogged and smeared with sweat and grease and breathy condensation, but still \nits denizens can be seen by the masses of the starving that crowd around the \nedges. They cannot help but look inside, begging and weeping and hissing and \nfalling as they wait for somebody, anybody, to stop the things that kill them. \n[Door opens and closes, outside sounds disappear] \n[In the distance, distorted gleeful laughs while old-time dancehall \nmusic plays] \n[Footsteps as the Minister continues, getting closer to the laughter]", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 2, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 3598}}
