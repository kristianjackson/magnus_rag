They had radioed ahead and we knew that we had a pair of severe \nburn victims being brought in, so we were as ready as we could have been. I \nwas heading out to meet the ambulance, when I noticed that the A&E waiting \nroom was totally silent. I looked around and there were all the people there \nthat I expected to see, some cradling obvious injuries, but none of them made \na sound. They continued to stare at their phone, read books, comfort one \nanother, but not one of them spoke. I didn’t have much time to really consider \nwhat I was seeing as, at that moment, I heard the ambulance pull up outside \nand ran off to see to the patient. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG012 – First Aid \n3 \n \nBy the time I arrived, they were already wheeling him out and the doctor was \nassessing his burns. The doctor’s name was Kayleigh Grice and she was a junior \ndoctor at St Thomas. She started giving some instructions to myself and the \nEMTs, but I was struck by how quietly she was speaking to me. She didn’t \nwhisper but every word was quiet, as though it was a real effort to get them \nout. Nobody else seemed to notice, so at the time I assumed the effect was \ndue to my own lack of sleep. I’ve always had difficulty adjusting to the late \nnights and this time had been particularly bad. We finished transferring him to \na treatment room, the only available one we had that night, and the doctor \nand EMTs returned to get the other patient while I began dealing with the \nburns on the first one. \nI’m 48 years old, and I have been a nurse for most of them, so I’ve seen a good \nnumber of burns in my time. I was prepared for some deeply unpleasant \nscenes when the call came in, as bad burns can be some of the nastiest injuries \nyou see working in a hospital. These ones surprised me. They were second \ndegree, which is severe, but not usually such as to require hospitalisation, \nexcept that they appeared to cover his entire body. Every inch of exposed skin \nshowed signs of this burning and, cutting away his clothes, it became apparent \nthat the damage had spread there as well. Anything hot enough to cause this \nsort of effect should have damaged his clothing or even melted them onto the \nskin in places but they were utterly unharmed, as though he had been dressed \nafter he’d been burned or the heat had passed right through his clothes \nwithout touching them. \nHe was a tall man, heavy-set with the sort of build I associated with an athletic \nmiddle age. Any hair he might have had was gone, apparently burned off, and \nhis clothes were a nondescript black suit and white shirt. He didn’t scream or \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG012 – First Aid \n4 \n \ncry or moan in pain, and in fact the doctor had had to check his pulse when \nhe’d come in to confirm he was still alive. He was, but as far as I could tell he \nappeared to be sleeping peacefully. \nI had just started treatment when the second patient was wheeled in. He was \nin almost identical shape to the first, except for the fact that the burns seemed \nto stop at his neck, along a clear line. It was as though he’d been wearing a \nchoker that the damage couldn’t get above but his neck was bare. He was \nsmaller than the first man, and younger, I’d guess in his mid-thirties. He was \nclean-shaven, but had long hair dyed completely black. He wore a similar suit \nto the older man, except that over the top he wore a long black leather coat, \njust as undamaged as the rest. It looked new, and I felt quite bad having to cut \nit off him, but we had to confirm how extensive his injuries were. Like the first, \nhe was completely covered in almost uniform second-degree burns, except for \nwhat at first I thought were small black scorch marks. Looking closer, I saw that \nthey were eyes. Small, tattooed eyes on every one of his joints: his knees, his \nelbows and even his knuckles, as well as just over his heart. I would have \nexpected the burns to have almost destroyed tattoos that small but instead \nthey were unblemished and the skin about a centimetre around each one also \ndidn’t seem to have been affected. \nTo say I was unsettled by this would have been something of an \nunderstatement. I barely noticed when the Dr Grice and the EMTs returned. \nThey seemed to be talking normally now, and discussing who these two people \nwere. Apparently the fire brigade had responded to reports of a blaze in a \nbuilding site near St Mary’s churchyard, and had turned up to find the two men", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 1, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 4498}}
