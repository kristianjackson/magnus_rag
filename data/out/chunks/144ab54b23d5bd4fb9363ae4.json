In front of him lay a man I didn’t know, but he was clearly \ndead – his chest had been cut open and still gaped and bled feebly. In one \nhand my father held a wicked-looking knife, and in the other he held the man’s \nheart. My father was chanting and as the song rose and fell the heart in his \nhand beat to its rhythm, and the blue light brightened and dimmed in time. I \nlooked at the walls, and noticed that they were covered in shelves, each of \nwhich contained glass jars, full of what I would later learn was formaldehyde \ncontaining a single heart, which also beat in time with the one that dripped in \nmy father’s hand. It was an odd thing to notice at the time but I remember that \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG009 – A Father’s Love \n13 \n \nthe dead man wore the same pendant as my mother – a silver hand with a \nclosed eye design. \nI don’t know how long I stood there staring. It might have been hours or it \nmight have been only a moment or two. But then I heard that growl behind me \nand sensed a presence so close that I could feel the darkness on my back. \nBefore I could react or move or scream, my father’s chant came to a crescendo \nand he plunged the dagger into the beating heart. All at once the presence \nvanished and the blue glow died. I could no longer hear the beating of the \nhearts. In the silence, I realised I could hear police sirens in the distance. I \nheard my dad tell me he was sorry, and then he started to run. \nYou know the rest. Manhunt, trial, prison, death. They say there were 40 \nhearts kept in that shed, not including his last victim, but of course the police \ndidn’t arrive until all that was left of it was a grisly trophy cabinet. Whatever I \nhad seen my father doing in there, its effects had long since vanished. I don’t \nknow why my father did what he did, and I doubt I ever will, but the more I go \nover these events in my head, the more sure I am that he had his reasons. \nJONATHAN SIMS \nRecording Ends. \nThere’s not much more to be added here. The police reports on Robert \nMontauk are predictably thorough, and there are few details to be added. The \nvast majority of research into this case has already been done by the serial \nkiller enthusiast community which, though weird and deeply unsettling, does \noften prove to be surprisingly useful in high-publicity cases like this. \nIn addition to the body of one Christopher Lorne, forty preserved hearts were \nrecovered from Robert Montauk’s shed. They were arranged on the walls on \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG009 – A Father’s Love \n14 \n \nindividual shelves forming patterns of eleven hearts on each inner wall and \nseven on the wall with the door. Photos of the patterns match up to the \nvarious formula of sacred geometry but don’t appear to correspond exactly \nwith any specific school. Of possible significance also is that fact that the rest \nof the bodies were never found. \nThe symbol on the two pendants is that of the Peoples’ Church of the Divine \nHost, a small cult that grew around the defrocked Pentecostal minister \nMaxwell Rayner in London during the late eighties and early nineties. I knew I \nrecognised the name from Statement 1106922 though, currently, it just looks \nlike a coincidence. Christopher Lorne was a member of the church and his \nfamily hadn’t heard from him in the six years prior to his murder. Mr Rayner \nhimself disappeared from public view sometime in 1994 and the group \nfragmented shortly afterwards. The police made many attempts to follow up \non this lead in the Montauk case, but were never able to locate any members \nwilling to make statements. \nThe house on York Road is still inhabited, though the current owners pulled \ndown the shed over a decade ago and replaced it with a patio \nStatement ends. \n \n[The Magnus Archives Theme - Outro] \n \nThe Magnus Archives is a podcast distributed by Rusty Quill and licensed under \na creative commons attribution, non-commercial share alike 4.0 international \nlicense.
