Perhaps she \nsuspected how much my mind drifted to Agnes when I held her in my arms. I \nknow she wondered about how I started keeping petrol in the cupboard, and \nabout my newfound love of scented candles. \nBut she never asked. Never ever mentioned it. Perhaps on some level, she \nknew as well as I did where we were headed, but there are some things you \njust have to accept that in the end they’ll cause you pain. \nI should have been caught, really. For all that it gifted to me, my faith did little \nto hide my crimes beyond ensuring they were scoured of physical evidence. \nAnd I know the police were investigating a possible serial murderer targeting \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG089 – Twice as Bright \n14 \n \npeople in my industry. But for whatever reason, they never gave me a second \nlook. I later learned my new brothers and sisters of the Lightless Flame had \ntaken it upon themselves to help hide my crimes, but even they are only \nhuman. Some of them, at least. \nI know now they were simply guiding me upon the path to my true epiphany. \nAll this time I was serving my god, but only for my own glory. But with each \nnew gift, each renewal of the fire, I saw how lifeless and hollow it was, how \ngrey and ashen my existence had become. It became clear that, where once I \nhad destroyed to fuel my life, I now lived for the pain that I caused. And for \nAgnes. My sweet, hopeless Agnes. \nAnd so I ended it. For all the agony and pain on Gretchen’s face, she didn’t \nseem surprised when I doused myself in kerosene and set it alight. I think she \nscreamed. She must have screamed. But I couldn’t hear it. As the heat warped \nmy bones and bubbled my flesh, all I heard was the loving exaltation of my \ngod. \nJUDE \nHuh. I suppose you did compel me after all. \nARCHIVIST \nB-But what about, um – \nJUDE \nUh-uh-uh. Try again and I will actually kill you. I don’t care what favours your \nboss might have done for me, I will tell my story to your smouldering corpse. \nARCHIVIST \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG089 – Twice as Bright \n15 \n \nFine. I just wanted to know when it happened, is all. \nJUDE \nI met Agnes in 1989, and completed my transformation in 1991. \nARCHIVIST \nOh. I-It’s just that you don’t… I mean you don’t seem like you’re, what, in your \nfifties? Or – Or burnt to a crisp. \nJUDE \nWax is remarkably easy to mould. \n[Jude demonstrates how easy she is to mould. The Archivist is audibly \nhorrified.] \nJUDE \n(Laughs) Oh come on! You’re going to need a much stronger stomach than that \nif you’re going to walk this path. \nARCHIVIST \nI-I-I mean… I don’t… \nJUDE \nIt’s like you’re not even listening. You have your god, as I have mine. Feed it, \nfearlessly and without hesitation, or it will feed on you. \nARCHIVIST \nBut I don’t… I don’t… I mean, I mean, what do I feed it? \nJUDE \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG089 – Twice as Bright \n16 \n \nI don’t know? You’re the one it picked. Not a great choice, if you ask me. \nARCHIVIST \nI didn’t ask you. Look, is there anything else you can tell me? \nJUDE \nYes. \nARCHIVIST \nAnything you’re willing to tell me? \nJUDE \nNo. \nARCHIVIST \nI don’t suppose I could talk to anyone else in your, um… \nJUDE \nIt’s fine, you can call it a cult. And no, they wouldn’t hesitate. They’re not as \nfriendly as I am. \nARCHIVIST \nWell, thank you for the… advice. And the dead end. \nJUDE \nWait. \nARCHIVIST \nHmm? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG089 – Twice as Bright \n17 \n \nJUDE \nIf you’re really keen to keep chatting to things that could kill you, I might know \nsomeone. We’re not on great terms, he’s closer to your lot than mine, but I \nknow where he… exists. \nARCHIVIST \nWho… What is he? \nJUDE \nCalls himself Mike. \nARCHIVIST \nMichael? \nJUDE \nI guess Mike is normally short for Michael, yeah? \nARCHIVIST \nCorridors, weird limbs, laughs like a… headache? \nJUDE \nWhat? No. He’s pale, got a big, weird scar. Smells of, um… \nARCHIVIST \nOh, ozone! \nJUDE \nYeah, that’s the one. Hangs around with the Fairchilds sometimes. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG089 – Twice as Bright \n18 \n \nARCHIVIST \nMichael Crew. \nJUDE \nThat’s him. I know where you can find him. \nARCHIVIST \nWhere? \nJUDE \nNot for free. \nARCHIVIST \nOkay. What do you want? \nJUDE \nOh, nothing much. Just shake my hand. \nARCHIVIST \nW-What? \nJUDE \nYou hurt my feelings earlier. I want you to shake my hand. Come on. It won’t \nhurt. \nARCHIVIST \nFine. \n[The sound of something burning.]", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 4, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 4391}}
