Sure, maybe it’s not as complicated or... \nexistential as our fear, but it’s real. And there’s, what, twenty billion chickens \nin the world? A few billion pigs, cows... How many of them are dying of old \nage? All that terror, it has to go somewhere. So it does. \nARCHIVIST \nAnd when something formed out of an animalistic fear of the slaughterhouse \nreaches out to, to people... \nGERARD \nThings get weird. Yeah. It gets mixed all up with human neuroses: bodies, gore, \ny’know, that nagging worry that deep down we’re just electrified meat \nsqueezing air at each other. \nARCHIVIST \nGood lord. \nGERARD \n\nI think it’s quite new. Only just beginning its, uh, ascendance when Smirke \nlabelled it. Before that there just weren’t enough animals for it to be a fear of \nits own. Back then I think the only animal fear was The Hunt. \nARCHIVIST \nThe Hunt is also animals? \nGERARD \nYeah. Been a long time since humans had any proper sense of our place on the \nfood chain. I mean, we haven’t been ‘prey’ for, what, thousands of years? \nARCHIVIST \nBut, I mean, hunting, killing each other. That-That’s just how wild animals \nwork. I-I-It’s... natural. \nGERARD \nSo’s death. But we’re still afraid of it. \nARCHIVIST \nI suppose. And again, when an animalistic fear touches a human... \nGERARD \nYou get the Predator’s granddad out there. \nARCHIVIST \n(Considering) This is, uh… No, I don’t have time. Tell me about the rituals. \nGERARD \nWell, they all have one. Most of them, anyway. Takes centuries to build up to a \nlevel of power where they can try it, and if they fail, it’s back to square one. \nARCHIVIST \nOkay, but what do the rituals do? \nGERARD \n\nThey… kind of ‘shift’ the world, just enough for the Power to come through. \nMerge with reality. Some say, or well, they guess, that it could bring others \nentities through with them. I mean, I doubt The Buried would be bringing \nthrough The Vast, but you know. \nARCHIVIST \nBut what does that actually mean. F-For the world? ‘Merging with reality’? \nGERARD \nOkay, well... You know how I was just talking about the Hunt and the Flesh? \nARCHIVIST \nYes. \nGERARD \nWell, think of it this way: right now all the entities have to act like a hunter, \nthey pick off the weak ones around the edges, the ones that wander to close, \nand the rest of the time they have to just graze on whatever fear we all \npassively give away. \nARCHIVIST \nAnd if one of the rituals succeeds? \nGERARD \nThe world becomes a factory farm. \nARCHIVIST \nWhy would anyone want that? I-I mean, there are people, or they used to be \npeople, who are trying to do this. Why? \nGERARD \nI dunno. Power, maybe? Or they’ve just got close enough to their patron or \nwhatever that they also feed on it. I guess maybe some people just have a \nweird relationship with fear. \n\nARCHIVIST \nAnd Gertrude wanted to stop them. At any cost. \nGERARD \nShe worked out they’d all be happening quite close together. She’d already \nbeen doing it a while. And the Unknowing was the next on her list. That and \nthe Watcher's Crown. \nARCHIVIST \nThe what? \nGERARD \nUh, the Rite of the Watcher’s Crown. It’s what she called the ritual for the Eye. \nShe didn’t tell me much about that one, just that she knew how to take care of \nit. To be honest, when she was going through this stuff, that was about the \ntime I thought I had found Leitner, so I wasn’t much in the mood to listen. \nARCHIVIST \nLeitner? \nGERARD \nYeah. Gertrude reckoned he was alive somewhere. Said she thought she’d \nfound him. I tracked him down, but it... well, it wasn’t him. \nARCHIVIST \nY-You’re sure? \nGERARD \nIt was just some pathetic old man. Couldn’t have been him. He was so scared \nof me, I just… just let him go. \nARCHIVIST \nAre you alright? \nGERARD \n\nI think... I think I’m ready to go. I’m done. Hide my page, and when you’re out \nof here, burn it. Please. \nARCHIVIST \nI will. Thank you, Gerard. \nGERARD \nGerry. \nARCHIVIST \nWhat? \nGERRY \nGerard was what my mum called me. (Embarrassed laugh) I always wanted my \nfriends to call me Gerry. \nARCHIVIST \nThank you, Gerry. Uh... I dismiss you. \n(Gerry sighs.) \n[There’s static as he fades.] \nOh. Alright \n[The book is closed.] \n(The Archivist clears his throat.) \nI’m ready! \n[Footsteps and a door opens] \nTREVOR \nAll done? \nARCHIVIST \nI… Yeah.
