Looking down, I could see that the veins, whose domination of the \ndreamscape had only ever been partial before, had thickened and now seemed \nto cover almost the whole space of every street. They still pulsed as before but \nrather than pumping their dark, unknown cargo invisibly, there would now \nsometimes be seen a dark red light that travelled along the inside of them. I \nthought I saw this red light illuminate faces and shadows within those tendrils \nbut it moved too quickly for me to be sure of any details beyond the direction. \nThis was not something I had ever seen happen before in these dreams, and I \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG011 – Dreamer \n8 \n \nwas aware that I had two choices: to follow the light to wherever it might lead \nor to turn and retreat into the waking world. I decided to follow the path of \nthat scarlet glow, though I found I was floating some distance from the ground, \nso thick were the vines below. I followed them for some time; how long exactly \nI couldn’t say. I never seemed to travel faster than walking speed in these \ndreams and yet the distances I covered as I passed through the orange twilight \nof this pulsating other London seemed far further than the time it took to \ntraverse. Such is the way of dreams, I suppose. \nAll I know for sure is that I realised after some time that the red light was \nleading me towards Vauxhall and the Thames. There were fewer people visible \nhere – did rich people die less? Or perhaps they just had greater control over \nwhere they died? Or maybe they just couldn’t be seen, fighting off death for so \nlong that when it came at last its icy tendrils covered every inch of them. I \ncrossed the Thames, and the bridge was knotted high with the flashing vines. \nOne or two of them seemed to pass through the river itself and the occasional \nflash of red could be seen beneath the water but most of them were laid \nacross the bridge. \nFinally, I saw the destination of the blood-tinged glow. A small building, \nstanding alone the other side of the bridge near the Embankment. I couldn’t \nhave told you what the street was called, the London of my dreams has no \nstreet signs. It was old, pillared and possessed of a quiet dignity. It was this \nbuilding into which all the veins flowed: every door, every window was solid \nwith them. When the bursts of red light passed into it, the whole building \nglowed crimson. I could see a bronze plaque next to the door, not quite \ncovered. It read: The Magnus Institute, London. Founded 1818. I entered, \nthough I couldn’t tell you how. The veins blocked every possible entrance \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG011 – Dreamer \n9 \n \nentirely and yet I found myself moving through them. I saw the corridors, \nthese corridors, choked with that shadowed flesh, and passed through them, \nfollowing that red light that would now pulse so bright that I knew were I to \nsee it awake it would have blinded me. It led me to a room, the label of which \nwas still visible, and read “Archive”. I entered to see walls covered with shelves \nand cabinets stretching off into the distance. These shelves were coated in a \nsticky black tar, which I knew at that moment was the thickened, pulpy blood \nthat pumped through each and every one of those veins. At the front of the \nroom stood a desk, and the veins were wrapped around it so tightly and so \nthick that I knew that this must be where they ended. \nGetting closer I realised that there was a person sitting at that desk and it was \nthem that all of this scarlet light was flowing into. I could see none of the \nfigure’s body beneath the flesh that enclosed them, but as I moved around I \nsaw the face was uncovered. It was your face and the expression upon it was \nfar more fearful than any I had seen in eight years of wandering this twilight \ncity. That was when I awoke. I’m well aware that I don’t even know your name, \nand I have no responsibility to try and prevent whatever fate is coming for you. \nBased on my previous experience, such a thing is likely impossible anyway, but \nafter what I saw I couldn’t live with myself if I didn’t at least try. I did as much \nresearch into your Institute as possible, and arranged an appointment to \nprovide a statement about some spurious supernatural encounter. Even then I \nwas told that the Archivist only reviews the written statements once they have \nbeen taken, so here I am, pouring out my lunatic story on pape", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 4, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 4499}}
