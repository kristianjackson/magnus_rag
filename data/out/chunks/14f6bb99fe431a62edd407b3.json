I don't think I should be here. What \nhappened was really weird and I'm pretty sure it was illegal, but it can't have \nbeen actually supernatural. Like ghosts and stuff. That's not real. No offence, I \nguess. I'm just here because I told Kathy what happened, and she insisted that \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG025 – Growing Dark \n2 \n \nI tell your Institute. She's more open to that kind of thing than me. Maybe \nthat's why she chose to live with Natalie. \nSorry, I should start at the beginning. Kathy's my girlfriend. Katherine Harper. \nWe've been dating about a year and a half now. She graduated last year but \nI'm doing a medical degree, so I'm not leaving London for another couple of \nyears. She managed to get a job as a trainee teacher up in East Ham, so ended \nup staying as well. I've got to say I'm glad about it. I'm not sure how good I'd be \nat a longdistance relationship. Anyway, the original plan was to move in \ntogether sooner, but stuff didn't match up properly and this was before she \ngot the job, so she had to move back with her parents for a while. Long story \nshort, I had to get a houseshare with some other med students, and she came \nup later, moving in with Natalie Ennis. \nI don't know where Kathy met her. They've always been friends, but I don't \nthink she was at uni with us. She never talked about it if she was. Kathy grew \nup in London, so maybe they were friends from school or something. She \nseemed nice, when I met her. Quiet, but nice. She was very serious, though. I \ndon't know if I ever actually heard her laugh. Maybe she just didn't find my \njokes funny. Who knows? She was religious, too. I've never had much time for \nGod, myself, and Kathy didn't either. That's why I was kind of surprised the first \ntime I visited her new place and found a framed Bible quote on the wall. Can't \nremember what it was. Something about Jesus and faith, I don't really know \nBible stuff. Kathy said it was Natalie's. She didn't mind her putting it up there in \nthe living room. Kathy's nice like that, you know? Just letting people be \nthemselves. \nMe and Natalie… didn't get on. I don't know if you picked up on that. We didn't \nhate each other or anything like that, we just… didn't have anything in", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 0, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 3051}}
