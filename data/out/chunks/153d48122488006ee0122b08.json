She told me that she had fallen to the \nground and lost consciousness almost immediately. \nWhen she awoke, the woman in the red dress was gone. Harriet had expected \nto find herself lying in a pool of blood from her stomach wound but could \ninstead find no trace of any injury anywhere, except for some scraped knees \nwhere she had fallen to the floor. She had staggered home and tried to sleep it \noff. Since then, she said she’d been seeing that woman everywhere she went. \nShe felt like she was being followed all the time and couldn’t stay in her own \nhome, as whenever she did it was like this weight was dragging her down. Her \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG006 – Squirm \n6 \n \nskin became so itchy as to be nearly unbearable. Harriet had apparently tried \nto go to the police, but said as she approached the station she was overcome \nwith such a powerful nausea that she threw up on the pavement. She had tried \nthe hospital but they just told her there was nothing obvious and to make an \nappointment with her doctor. She had been spending the last three days just \nwandering in cafés and bars and clubs, anywhere there were enough people \nthat she felt safe. She just didn’t know what to do. \nBy this point Harriet was crying and I felt like a complete asshole for having \nbrought the issue up. I mumbled some apologies. I don’t know what I said; I \nwas just trying to make her feel better. Not sure what I expected to happen \nbut I certainly didn’t expect her to kiss me at that moment. I know, I know, she \nwas vulnerable and I feel like an a… But I swear I wasn’t trying to take \nadvantage. I asked her again and again if she was sure, but she just kept \nnodding and dragged me to the bedroom. I mean, we had sex. There’s not \nmuch more to say about that, really. The important thing is what happened \nafterwards. \nAs we were lying there in bed, exhausted, I rested my head against her \nshoulder. I was about to say something or other, but before I could, I felt \nsomething move. It’s hard to describe exactly but it wasn’t her shoulder that \nmoved, it was something inside it, under the skin. It squirmed ever so slightly \nagainst my cheek. I shot up in bed, but the only indication that she’d noticed \nanything amiss was that she reached over and absentmindedly scratched \nwhere I’d been lying. I started to relax, lie down again; maybe I’d just imagined \nit. But at that moment she doubled over and groaned in sudden pain. Her eyes \nwent wide and she clutched her stomach tightly. I tried to see what was wrong, \nasked if I could help, but she just pushed me away. I had no idea what to do, so \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG006 – Squirm \n7 \n \nI ran out and towards the bathroom. My mind was going completely blank and \nI couldn’t remember whether I had any painkillers or indigestion medicine. Or \nshould I be calling an ambulance? I wasn’t sure, and I ended up rooting \nthrough my medicine cabinet, looking for… I don’t know; anything that might \nhave helped. I could still hear Harriet moaning in agony from the bedroom, and \nhad just made up my mind to call for an ambulance, when I heard something \nthat stopped me dead in my tracks. \nIt’s hard to really describe the sound that came from the bedroom. The closest \nI could come would be to say it sounded like… an egg being dropped onto a \nstone floor; a sort of wet, cracking thump. Then silence. Harriet was no longer \nmaking any noise at all. I slowly, very slowly, walked back towards the \nbedroom. The door was open, but I hadn’t turned the light on, so there was \nlittle to be seen inside except darkness. I could have turned on the light in the \nhall, I suppose, but something inside made me think that I didn’t want a good \nlook inside that room. I stopped at the threshold. The only illumination at all \ncame from a thin sliver of light coming in through the gap in the curtains from \na streetlamp outside. \nYou’ll have to excuse me. What I saw is difficult to put down on paper, but it’s \nthe only way to explain why I had to do it. Why setting my flat alight and \nstanding naked in the winter streets until the fire brigade arrived was far \nbetter than spending another second in that place. And yes, I admit here I set \nthe fire myself. Show it to the police for all I care, I just need someone to \nunderstand. \nThe room was unrecognisable when I returned. There was a shape on the bed, \nwhere Harriet had laid, but it wasn’t her anymore. I could barely make o", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 3, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 4500}}
