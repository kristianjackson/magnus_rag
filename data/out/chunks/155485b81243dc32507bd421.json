Original statement given December 3rd, 2002. Audio recording by \nJonathan Sims, the Archivist. \nStatement begins. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 155 – Cost of Living \n7 \n \nARCHIVIST (STATEMENT) \nYou’ve got to understand, I have so much to live for. Oh, okay, that’s not quite it. I \nknow most people have plenty to live for, but what I mean is that my life does \ngood. I put a lot into the world. Did you read about that homelessness initiative \nthat got 8,000 people into shelters? That was me. I’ve financed drug projects, \norganized inner city violence initiatives. I’ve always been so aware of the position \nI’m in, and keen to use that power to actually help people. And that’s not money \nfrom some trust fund. I mean sure my parents loaned me the money to start, but I \nbuilt my business up from the ground, and we now provide jobs for almost 700 \npeople. And I know that everyone’s life has value, but I just need to be clear that \nmy impact on the world is a positive one. My existence does a lot of good, and \nthat’s only gotten more true since all this started. I’ve given more, spent more \ntime on charitable stuff, and helped more people. Sorry, I’m just... aware of how \nthis story makes me look and I don’t want you to think I’m some selfish monster \ngrinding people up just to extend my own ghoulish life. I’m trying to do good. \nI’ve always tried to live a healthy life; never smoked or did drugs, watched my \ndiet, got plenty of exercise. So when I had an epileptic seizure, the first one of my \nentire life, the month before my wedding... that wasn’t fair. I mean, even if I had \nto have epilepsy - which I could live with - having my first attack at the top of a \nstaircase, five weeks before the happiest day of my life, that’s just not fair! There \nwas no reason for it, I’d done everything right! It shouldn’t have happened like \nthat. \nI remember the odd tingling feeling rising up from my stomach, through my lungs, \nuntil it hit my head. I’d never felt anything like it. I didn’t know what to do and \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 155 – Cost of Living \n8 \n \neven if I had I don’t know if I could have done it in time. I don’t remember falling \nexactly, just the world spinning and moving around me as I remained absolutely \nstill. There were these cracks, like gunshots in my head. And even now I don’t \nknow if that was part of the seizure, or how my mind processed the breaking \nbones. Then I was on the ground, looking back up the stairs, and thinking to \nmyself how strange it was that I wasn’t there. I’d been stood just there, so why \ncouldn’t I see myself? Everything seemed very loud, then very quiet, then very \nbright. The last thing I saw was a man rushing to help. He was wearing a t-shirt \nwith a silly little cartoon alien on it, and I thought, was that from an advert? And \nthen I went away. \nYou know, it’s strange. I’d never really feared death. I’m agnostic... Was agnostic... \nAnd always thought that if there was a God, then He’d know what was in your \nheart, and if you’d lived a good life then you’d be alright. But more likely I thought \nit would be nothing. No heaven or hell, no thought or sensation, just... Nothing. \nYou wouldn’t even notice you were gone. But it wasn’t like that at all. I don’t \nknow if I have words for it. How can you describe being aware of the absence of \neverything? Life. Light. Warmth. It was very dark, and very cold. It dawned on me \nthat this might be my existence forever. There, beyond time, and I tried so \ndesperately to scream, but I had no lungs or throat in that dreadful place. I \ncouldn’t even cry. Then I was back in the light with such a sudden jolt that I found \nmyself trying to blink, even though I had no eyelids or even eyes. But I could still \nsee. \nI was standing in what seemed to be an operating theatre. Doctors and nurses in \nscrubs and masks buzzed around and through me, busy with something on the", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 1, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 4474}}
