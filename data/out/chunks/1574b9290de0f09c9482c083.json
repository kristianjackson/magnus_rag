I don't know how long I lay \nthere; it was too cramped to check the time, but it felt like hours. I wanted to \ngo back and check, but I couldn't even turn around to see. I just waited for a \nsplash that never came. \nI decided to go on, press forward until I at least found somewhere wide \nenough that I could turn. As crawled on, I scraped against the jagged rocks \nuntil I felt them pressing into my bare skin where my clothes had ripped. I can \ndeal with it when I'm out, I kept thinking, but the passage just got smaller and \nsmaller, until at last I couldn’t move any further. I finally accepted that I was \ngoing to have to try and squeeze back the way I had come without even \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG015 – Lost John’s Cave \n10 \n \nturning round. I started to shuffle backwards, and my feet touched against \nsolid rock. The tunnel was gone. It was then that I screamed. And my light \nwent out. \nI said earlier that I enjoyed the pure dark of the cave. I was wrong. I had never \ntruly known a darkness like this. Unable to move, barely with breathing space \nenough to cry for help. Even as I lay there it felt as though the walls pressed \nme further, and I knew that the stone I had always believed to be my friend \nand protector, was going to entomb me here. \nIn the distance I saw the faintest point of light. It looked like a candle flame, far \ndown the tunnel, so weak that it lit nothing but itself. It grew closer, but any \nhope it might have given me quickly died as it grew. It was coming towards me \nso slowly, and deep down I knew that it was... of this place. It meant me harm. \nAs it got closer, I saw the pale hand that held it, and I heard something. It was \nAlena. It sounded far off and muffled, but I was sure she was calling for help. I \nshut my eyes, for all the good it did in that place, and tried desperately to will \nit all away. When I opened my eyes again, the light was still there, but it had \nchanged somehow. It seemed brighter and, as I looked, I realised it was no \nlonger coming from a candle. I could hardly believe it, but it looked like \ndaylight. \nWith every last ounce of strength I possessed I pushed myself forward. Had I \nbeen climbing this whole time? My clothes were ragged and torn, my skin \nscraped and bloody, but after nearly an hour I broke onto the surface through \na small opening not on any of the maps. I breathed in fresh, cool air and I \nscreamed as long and loud as I could. That was how Alistair and the cave \nrescue team found me. Apparently I'd been underground for almost twenty-\nfour hours, and he had called in the cave rescue service. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG015 – Lost John’s Cave \n11 \n \nI was well cared for, as I waited for news of Alena. My wounds were treated \nand I was given food and water. It took another day before the rescue team \ntold me what I think I already knew: there was no sign of her anywhere. I never \nsaw her again, and she was added to the list of fatalities, so I suppose that's an \nend of it. I haven't been underground since, and I don't intend to. \nJONATHAN SIMS \nStatement ends. \nThis is a strange one. I have rarely come across a statement written with such \nconviction, yet where so many of the details are provably false. The CNCC have \nno record of Ms. Popham getting a permit for this expedition, and the number \nof other permits they issued for June 14th would indicate that they certainly \nweren't the only ones in the cave that day. Beyond that, Death’s Head Hole \nand Lost John’s Cave are, as Ms. Popham pointed out, well-documented in \nlayout and, according to Sasha's reckoning, the route she described is \nborderline nonsensical. \nWhat is true is that on 15th of June the Yorkshire Dales Cave Rescue \nOrganisation was contacted by Mr. Alistair Popham, who told them his wife \nand sister-in-law had gone caving the day before and had not returned. I sent \nTim to check the details – Martin declined to help with this investigation as \nhe's \"a bit claustrophobic\" – and he found some more bizarre discrepancies. \nMs. Popham was not found above ground, as she claimed. She was found a \nfew yards from the bottom of Death’s Head Hole, unresponsive and kneeling \nnext to a small pile of burned out candles. Alistair Popham claims not to have \nseen any such things being packed. She only came out of this stupor when \nbrought above ground, at which point she started shouting about her sister \nAlena, demanding they go and \"save her\".", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 6, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 4456}}
