He spent the next twenty years publishing widely-\nderided collections of poetry, as well as essays on belief and atheism that were \nroundly ignored by the philosophical salons of the time. He was supported by \nseveral literary friends, as he was reputedly a gifted editor, even if his own \nwork was often all but incomprehensible. \nGarland Hillier’s final essay, published in 1867 and simply titled L’Avenir (The \nFuture) was supposedly a rambling and meandering speculation on the end of \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 134 – Time of Revelation \n \n3 \n \nthe human race. Influenced by Darwin’s recent publication of On the Origin of \nSpecies and his own shattered faith, he posited a future where, far from any \nglorious or holy revelation or reckoning, a decadent and corrupt humanity was \nviolently and utterly supplanted and wiped out by a new category of being, \none he referred to as “les héritiers”, “the inheritors”. He gave no details on \nwhat he believed they might look like or how they might behave, but his \npredictions for the final days of humanity were unpleasant and visceral. \nThe piece was not popular or widely distributed at the time and has, for the \nmost part, been utterly forgotten by history. I’ve been unable to find any \naccessible copy myself and have had to rely largely on professor Delcour’s \nrecollections of its contents, as she has the dubious distinction of being one of \nthe few academics familiar with Hillier’s work. Anyway, the point is that some \ntime after that essay was published, Garland Hillier disappeared. Exactly when \nthis happened, no-one is really sure, but the last records of his existence can \nbe found near the end of 1867. No contemporaries commented on his \ndisappearance, nor was there any search inquiry, but neither is there any \nrecord of his death or indication of emigration or travel. Despite his dubious \nacademic credentials, he was apparently a man who consistently attempted to \ncourt the public eye, and his disappearance has long been a puzzlement, if not \na full-blown mystery, in certain academic circles for a long time. \nSo, it’s probably not surprising that, when Bernadette got a call from Paris \ntelling her that some workmen had discovered Garland Hillier’s apartment, it \ngot her on a train almost immediately. And it certainly was a discovery, in the \nmost literal sense. On the fifth floor of an apartment building on the Rue \nLagarde, near the Panthéon, some construction workers had uncovered a door \nthat had at some point in the past been completely plastered over.
