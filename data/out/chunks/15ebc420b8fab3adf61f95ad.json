Always looking for ways to grow and spread. \nARCHIVIST \nNo… B-B-But that doesn’t— I m-mean, it doesn’t make— \nGERARD \nWhat? So you thought it was coincidence that unknowable alien \nconsciousnesses from beyond our universe just so happen to basically be all \nthe things we’re terrified of? \nARCHIVIST \nI— How?! \nGERARD \nNo idea. \nSmarter people than me have died trying to figure that one out. I mean, maybe \nthey appeared out of nothing the first time something felt afraid. Maybe \nthey’re older than that, and they just got inspired by all the things that we \ndread. Did they made themselves from our fears, or are they why we’re afraid? \nI really don’t know. \n\nARCHIVIST \nBut, but not everything they do inspires fear. \nGERARD \nAnd if you’re having an omelette for lunch, not every moment is spent eating \nthe omelette. Some things take preparation. Especially if, you know, your \nspatula has a bit of free will. And sometimes I think bits of them just... ooze \ninto the world without any purpose at all. Or sometimes they’re summoned. \nARCHIVIST \nFears change. Fears are-are-are cultural. \nGERARD \nA lot of them, yeah, but others are deeper than that. And when our fears \nchange, so do these things. But it’s not quick. Gertrude reckons they’ve \nbasically been the same since the Industrial Revolution. She and my mum both \nliked to follow Smirke’s list of fourteen. \nARCHIVIST \n(Disbelievingly) Th— I mean, there are a lot more than fourteen things to be \nafraid of in the world. Where do you draw the line? \nGERARD \nHmmm. I always think it helps to imagine them like colours. The edges bleed \ntogether, and you can talk about little differences: “oh, that’s indigo, that’s \nmore lilac”, but they’re both purple. I mean, I guess there are technically \ninfinite colours, but you group them together into a few big ones. A lot of it’s \nkind of arbitrary. I mean, why are navy blue and sky blue both called blue, \nwhen pink’s an entirely different colour from red? Y’know? I don’t know, that’s \njust how it works. And like colours, some of these powers, they feed into or \nbalance each other. Some really clash, and you just can’t put them together. I \nmean, you could see them all as just one thing, I guess, but it would be pretty \nmuch meaningless, y’know, like… like trying to describe a… shirt by talking \nabout the concept of colour. O-Of course, with these things it’s not a simple \nspectrum, y’know, it’s more like— \n\nARCHIVIST \nAn infinite amorphous blob of terror bleeding out in every direction at once. \nGERARD \nNow you’re getting it. \nARCHIVIST \nLike colours, but if colours hated me. Got it. Christ, I need a cigarette. \nGERARD \nYeah, well, you can wait. Don’t know how much longer we have. \nARCHIVIST \nHang on, if these entities are all based on our, on our fear, the-the-then what, \nwhat about the, the rest— \nGERARD \nNo. There aren’t any god-like powers of hope, or love, or indigestion, or \nwhatever. At not that I’ve seen. Just fear. I don’t know why. \nARCHIVIST \nFine. So… so, I know a, a few… but what are they, these fourteen? \nGERARD \nRobert Smirke divided the beings into fourteen distinct Powers, each \ncomprising a variety of smaller terrors, some direct and practical, and some \nmore abstract. \nARCHIVIST \nR-r-right. I know The Eye. Fear of being watched, right? \nGERARD \n\nBeing watched, being followed, having your deepest secrets exposed. Needing \nto know, even if your discoveries might destroy you. The feeling that \nsomething, somewhere, is letting you suffer, just so it can watch. \nARCHIVIST \nIs… is that me? Is… is that what I do? \nGERARD \nYou’re the Archivist, you tell me. \nARCHIVIST \nAh… Ah. The Spiral is the fear of madness, right? That worry that your world \nisn’t right, th-that your mind is lying to you? \nGERARD \nYeah, pretty much. \nARCHIVIST \nAnd The End is fear of death. \nGERARD \nSimple, but always there \nARCHIVIST \nThe Stranger is the, the unknown. The uncanny. \nGERARD \nThat kind of creeping sense that something’s not right. That guy you saw that \nmight be following you, might mean you harm. \nARCHIVIST \nIsolation. \nGERARD", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 5, "chunk_count": 9, "chars": 4114}}
