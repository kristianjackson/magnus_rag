I suppose it \nwas too much to hope that we’d finally dealt with all that remained of his \nlibrary after the incident in 1994, but it would have been useful if Gertrude had \nat least thought to add this statement to the current project file. Who knows \nhow many other statements are in here that might deal with his books or other \ncurrently active Institute projects? If my luck thus far is anything to go by, then \nI’d say it is unlikely this was an isolated example. The more I discover about \nthis archive, the more it seems Gertrude simply took the written statements \nand threw them into these files without even reading them. Given that she was \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG004 – Page Turner \n15 \n \nHead Archivist for over fifty years, then that is… This might be a bigger job than \nI originally thought. \nRegardless, most of the verifiable details in Mr Swain’s account seem to match \nup with our own researches. Martin couldn’t find any records of Ex Altiora as a \ntitle in existent catalogues of esoteric or similar literature, so I assigned Sasha \nto double-check. Still nothing. Is it possible Mr Swain got the title wrong? It \nseems unlikely, given the simplicity of it, and the… occurrences he describes \ncertainly sound like they could have been due to the proximity of a true Leitner \ntome. \nStill, all the other books from his library have been custom editions of known \ntexts on daemonology or the arcane. If there are Leitners out there that we \nhaven’t even heard of, I fear that may be cause for some small alarm. \nUseful details for follow-up are few and far between, however. Donation \nrecords at the Oxfam charity shop in Notting Hill Gate only have anonymous \ndonations listed for books in October/November 2012, and obviously none of \nthe staff recall the book. We’ve also been unable to locate Gerard Keay at all. \nAside from this encounter, he seems to have almost entirely disappeared \nfollowing the end of his trial. The description Mr Swain gives does appear to \nmatch file photos of Gerard and Mary Keay, and from his description it sounds \nlike he did find his way to what used to be Pinhole Books in Morden, although \nit has been closed since 2008 for obvious reasons, and no new tenants moved \nin until 2014. There was one interesting thing Tim found out, though, in the \nofficial police report on Mary Keay’s death – apparently, the drying sheets of \nskin had been written over in permanent marker. There was no transcription \nor translation of it in the report but the language was identified to be Sanskrit. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG004 – Page Turner \n16 \n \nSo it doesn’t appear that we have any concrete leads to go on. Still, I will be \nbringing this up with Elias and recommending that the search for any other \nmissed books from the Leitner library be made this Institute’s highest priority. \nJurgen Leitner has done the world enough harm and we must pursue all \navailable avenues to ensure that he does no more. \nRecording ends. \n[The Magnus Archives Theme - Outro] \n \nThe Magnus Archives is a podcast distributed by Rusty Quill and licensed under \na creative commons attribution, non-commercial share alike 4.0 international \nlicense.
