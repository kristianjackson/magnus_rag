I’ve never met anyone so \ngifted at understanding that strange dream-logic of the fears, and if what I \nsuspect about this new power is true, it could be catastrophic. Until then, I’ll \nkeep searching for evidence, trying to find instances and manifestations of The \nExtinction. I’ll keep you updated. \nStay safe. \nAdelard. \nMARTIN \n(Exhales) So that’s it, is it? \n[Static rises] \nPETER \nIt is. \nMARTIN \nA new Power. \nPETER \nThe Extinction, yes. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 134 – Time of Revelation \n \n9 \n \nMARTIN \nSo… so, what? You’re afraid of the competition? \nPETER \nNot at all. Honestly, that’s the sort of thing I normally relish. I’ve always been a \nlittle bit of a gambler, and the higher the stakes, the better. \nMARTIN \nSo… So, this is what? \nPETER \nThis is different. \nMARTIN \nI’m listening. \nPETER \nGood, it’s about time. There are two Powers that, to my knowledge, have \nnever attempted to fully manifest, never had followers set them up for a ritual: \nMother-of-Puppets and Terminus. The Web and The End. The Web I’ve never \nreally been sure about. If I were to guess, I would say it actually prefers the \nworld as is, playing everyone against each other and so on. The End, on the \nother hand… The End doesn’t really need one. It knows that it gets everything \neventually, so why bother? The End manifesting would not be a new world of \nterror, it would be a lifeless world, devoid of everything. \nMARTIN \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 134 – Time of Revelation \n \n10 \n \nIncluding fear. \nPETER \nExactly. It has no reason to truly attempt to enter our world. It’s passive, but \nThe Extinction… The Extinction is different. It is active. It will seek to create a \nlifeless world in a way that none of the other powers ever would. Some \ninterpretations suggest it might replace us with something new that can then \nfear annihilation in turn, but I, and those like me, would rather that did not \nhappen. \nMARTIN \nS-so, what? You want to stop it being born? \nPETER \nI don’t know if such a thing is even possible, but if it is, then yes. Or at the very \nleast, weaken it. \nMARTIN \nOkay ... Okay, so let’s say for now that I believe you, hypothetically. Wh-what \ndoes this have to do with me? \nPETER \nI’m still working out some of the kinks, but I believe I have a plan. However, it \nrequires this place, and it requires someone touched by the Beholding. Elias \nwas, perhaps unsurprisingly, unwilling to help. \nMARTIN \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 134 – Time of Revelation \n \n11 \n \nAnd you thought that, since I’m so lonely already, I’d be ideal. \nPETER \nYes. \nMARTIN \nYou see, the thing is, Peter, I’m still not all that keen on being part of any ritual \nyou set up. You know, in fact, if I were to be blunt, I’d say that it would be \nsuicidally stupid. \nPETER \n(Patiently) Martin, it’s going to be decades, if not centuries, before I get \nanother chance to bring Forsaken into this world. Your last Archivist saw to \nthat. Honestly, if Elias hadn’t killed that woman, I’d have been very tempted. I \nwarned him she was a danger, but he alway— \nMARTIN \nPeter. Peter. \nPETER \nAnyway, the point is that yes, obviously, if I last that long, I’m going to try \nagain. But I’m rather keen for the world not to end in the meantime. \nMARTIN \nHmm... \nPETER", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 5, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 3491}}
