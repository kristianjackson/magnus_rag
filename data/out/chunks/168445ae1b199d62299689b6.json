Well, well, I do, it was three \nhours, they told me. After. But it felt like... God, it felt like it could have been \nweeks. Never had a, a great sense of time and just— Gone. Everything, every \nbit of light or sound or, or anything that changed, that said time was passing. \nThere was nothing. Before that I never really thought about time, you know? \nBut now... Yeah. \nBut I was lying there, panicking, screaming, just trying to make any noise, any \nmovement that didn’t hurt like hell. And I... Okay. I felt something. No, I felt \nsomeone, grab my ankle. At first it was great, I had this, this huge wave of \nrelief, right? Someone had found me, they were getting me out. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 142 – Scrutiny \n \n5 \n \nBut no, it didn’t feel right. It wasn’t— It was cold, right? Like… like old stone, or \nwet sand. It felt, like, rough, and, and like the fingers weren’t... I don’t know, it \nfelt like they, they weren’t in the right places. And then I started thinking and I \nrealised something. The way it w— it was grabbing me, holding my leg, there \nwas— it had to have been coming upwards. From below me. And there was \nno-one else down there when that tunnel collapsed. Absolutely no-one. I’m \nsure. \nSo then I start screaming again. And kicking, thrashing about. It hurts but, I \nmean, I’m scared out of my mind, but the, the hand, it just grips tighter and I \ncan feel its fingernails just... It-It-It started pulling. It was pulling down, \ndragging me down. Into the earth. And I— I-I don’t know. I just— This close to \njust breaking, just absolutely shattering. And… and then this slab of stone came \naway in front of me and there was daylight, and, and Abby, one of the work \ncrew, was staring at me. And, and, yeah, just like that it was… gone. \nBut the bruise stuck around. Horrid, muddy bruises where the fingers had \ngrabbed me. \nSo, it, it took a long time to get over that. I mean, that’s not weird, right? I \nme— It was a bad time. You know, it, it stays with you. Was signed off, what, I \nthink about six months with the injuries. Had pretty bad, uh, nightmares, \nclaustrophobia, I mean, obviously, right? \nBut, uh, but, but I did my physio, and, you know, talked, talked with the \ncounsellor they gave me. Look, I did everything I was supposed to and, and \nyeah, I… I guess I was fine. You know, once the bruises were gone I— Well, it’s \neasy to blame memory, right? You know, ha-hallucination, coincidence, all the \nclassic shite you tell yourself. Life went back to normal. I— I was fine. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 142 – Scrutiny \n \n6 \n \nUntil about two weeks ago. \nMARTIN \nThat was when you met Jo— one of our employees? \nBYSTANDER \nThat’s when he showed up. \nY-You know the coffee shop, uh, just next to Pimlico? Uh, the, the nice one. \nWell, I a— I actually had a date there. You know, cute guy I met online. \nSeemed sporty, which, I kind of like and— Look, it doesn’t, it doesn’t matter. \nAnyway, I get a latte and sit down waiting for, uh, Grant? I wanna say Grant. Or \nGa-re… Gareth? Gary? Anyway, look, he’s running late, and, and, and I’m just \nreading. There’s this creep in, in the corner. Your guy. He just… keeps staring at \nme, like, like properly staring. Like, it is super intense and, and real weird. Like \nhe knows me, but I sure as hell do not know him. I— I try to ignore him, look, I \njust, I just read my book, and every time I look up there he is, watching me. \nYou know, I’m about to say something, you know, like, when in comes Gary? \nGareth? Gavin? and suddenly, hey, it’s a date. And I really didn’t want his first \nimpression of me to be, you know, me yelling at some creeper in the corner. So \nI just swap chairs so that I’ve got my back to your ‘colleague’, and get on with \nit. \nDidn’t really matter, you know, in the end, Gareth was a, was a bust. You \nknow, not like, you know, I mean... He, he was fine, I guess, it’s just there was \nnothing really there between us. You know? Just a nice, boring coffee with a \nkinda dull man. Took about an hour and he clearly wasn’t feeling it either, so", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 1, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 4072}}
