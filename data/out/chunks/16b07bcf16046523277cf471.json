And remember, that \nknowledge is not the same thing as understanding! \nARCHIVIST \nWhat do you want. \nHELEN \nTo say hello! And check up on the happy couple. \n(She laughs) \nI always knew you crazy kids would make it work. \n(The Archivist sighs) \nMARTIN \nThanks. \nARCHIVIST \nMartin. Look, I’ve no interest in your… gloating. \nHELEN \n(Innocently) What would I have to gloat about? Much as I am delighted by this \nbrave new world in which we find ourselves, I can take no credit for it. This was \nall… you! \nARCHIVIST \nYou could have— You knew what was happening. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 164 – The Sick Village \n21 \nHELEN \nI suspected. But all I really did was refuse to help! And that is hardly a unique \nquality. \n(The Archivist sighs) \nIf that makes it my fault, then surely this is Georgie’s fault as well, and \nMelanie’s— \nARCHIVIST \nLeave them out of this, they didn’t know! \nHELEN \nThere it is again! Knowledge! It’s so very important to you, isn’t it? These \nfossilized nuggets of pretend comprehension, weighing you down, stopping \nyou thinking or feeling! What about hypotheticals? If they had known, what \nwould they have done? Is that something you can see? \nARCHIVIST \nWhat. Do. You. Want! \nHELEN \nTo be friends again! All three of us. \n(The Archivist sighs) \nHELEN (CONT’D) \nLook at this place, look at this— (inhales deeply) Wonderland. This is the \nworld, now, and we are strong and free! There’s really no reason for us not to \nhang out. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 164 – The Sick Village \n22 \nGoodness, he is in a mood. Has he been like this the whole time? \nMARTIN \nNot the… whole time. \nHELEN \nThank goodness. \nARCHIVIST \nMartin… \nMARTIN \nIn fairness, he’s had a lot on. \nHELEN \n(Sympathetic) Oh, I’m sure. \nARCHIVIST \nMartin... please. \nMARTIN \nSorry, it’s just— maybe she can help. \nARCHIVIST \nWith what. \nMARTIN \nWith our, with our, with our quest! \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 164 – The Sick Village \n23 \n(The Archivist makes a displeased sound) \nWe’ve been walking a while, and well, her door’s… maybe we could, you know \n— shortcut! \nARCHIVIST \nNo. No, I don’t think that’s a good idea. \nHELEN \nI would happily take him. But I don’t think he’d want to leave you. \nMARTIN \nOkay, o-one, hm, don’t talk about me like I’m not here; it’s, rude. Two, I know \nyou can take two people at once. Me and Tim were both inside the corridors \nwhen it— \nARCHIVIST \nMartin, it’s not that si-simple. \nHELEN \nI’m afraid the Archivist is too powerful now. \n(The Archivist makes an annoyed sound) \nIf he tried to travel through my corridors, it would not go well, for any of us. \nARCHIVIST \nBut mainly for you. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 164 – The Sick Village \n24 \nHELEN \n(False pleasant) Ooo! Is that a threat? \nARCHIVIST \nNo. \nHELEN \nMm, pity! \nMARTIN \nSo, no shortcuts then. (sigh) Understood. I’m not leaving you on your own. \nHELEN \nOh! Such devotion. You really don’t deserve it. But of course, you know that \nalready! \n(Helen laughs) \nOh, this is nice! I am really glad we get to spend some proper, quality time \ntogether now. \nMARTIN \n(Unsure) ...Yeah. \nHELEN \nAnyway. Sorry to love you and leave you, but I must dash. It’s a very busy time \nfor me, lots of things to do, people to— well. You know! \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 164 – The Sick Village \n25 \nARCHIVIST \nI don’t doubt it. \n(Beat) \nMARTIN \n...What? \nHELEN \nJust taking a moment to look. You two are just such an adorable couple— \nARCHIVIST \nEnough! \n[Helen opens her door] \nHELEN \nSee you soon! \n[She walks into her corridors, the door shutting behind her] \n(The Archivist sighs) \nMARTIN \n(Upbeat) Maybe she’s right! \n[Static and high-pitched tone stops] \nARCHIVIST \nI am not, nor have I ever been, \"adorable.\"", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 5, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 3826}}
