The only illumination at all \ncame from a thin sliver of light coming in through the gap in the curtains from \na streetlamp outside. \nYou’ll have to excuse me. What I saw is difficult to put down on paper, but it’s \nthe only way to explain why I had to do it. Why setting my flat alight and \nstanding naked in the winter streets until the fire brigade arrived was far \nbetter than spending another second in that place. And yes, I admit here I set \nthe fire myself. Show it to the police for all I care, I just need someone to \nunderstand. \nThe room was unrecognisable when I returned. There was a shape on the bed, \nwhere Harriet had laid, but it wasn’t her anymore. I could barely make out \nanything even remotely human in the pile of pitted and warped flesh that now \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG006 – Squirm \n8 \n \nremained. The bed itself was slick and shiny with a dark fluid that dripped off \nthe hanging sheets and onto the floor. But what truly repulsed me, what made \nme flee as I did, was what moved and squirmed on all of it. They covered every \nsurface: the floor, the bed, what used to be Harriet, even the ceiling. A thick, \nmoving carpet of pale, writhing worms. \nThe flat burned for a very long time. \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nStatement ends. \nThis story is concerning. Not because of Mr Hodge’s experience, although I’m \nsure it was very upsetting. If it was true, of course. In fact, the police report \nthat Sasha was able to acquire throws doubt on much of his story. While Mr \nHodges’ flat did indeed catch fire on November 20th of last year, there was \napparently no evidence of arson and no human remains found inside, despite \nthe fact that the fire was brought under control long before any significant \ndamage was done to the structure of the building. They did find some charred \norganic matter in the bedroom but it was tested and apparently wasn’t human, \nthough the report doesn’t list whether its source was ever determined. \nI will say it does link up with the reported disappearance of one Harriet Lee, a \nstudent at Roehampton who was reported missing shortly after this statement \nwas originally given. She seems to match the description given here. Still, that’s \nnot really what concerns me either, though obviously it’s a tragic loss of life, \netcetera, etcetera. \nNo, what I find quite alarming is that if Mr Hodge’s recollection of Harriet’s tale \nis correct and she was attacked by a woman in a red dress in Archway, then \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG006 – Squirm \n9 \n \nthat matches the description and last known location of Jane Prentiss. I can’t \nfind any evidence that my predecessor took follow-up action on this \nstatement, so I’ve taken the step of reporting Mr Hodge’s to the ECDC. We \nwere unable to locate him to request a follow-up interview and if he has had \nintercourse with one of Prentiss’ victims, then they’ll need to deal with him \nsooner rather than later. I just hope it’s not too late already. \nRecording Ends. \n[The Magnus Archives Theme - Outro] \n \nThe Magnus Archives is a podcast distributed by Rusty Quill and licensed under \na creative commons attribution, non-commercial share alike 4.0 international \nlicense.
