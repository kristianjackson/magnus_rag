Straight blonde hair atop a round, \nfriendly face that never seemed to blink. \n‘It’s late,’ the flatmate said, her tone level. Carmen’s throat tightened. ‘I am \ntrying to sleep. This is not acceptable.’ \nThe words bit into Carmen and she felt her head swim and her heart race so \nfast she thought it was going to burst. What time was it? She hadn’t been \nmaking any noise, how had her flatmate known? This was her room, her space, \nshe was allowed to be awake, she was— \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 188 – Centre of Attention \n \n14 \nHer flatmate was still there, standing in the doorway, eyes locked on her. \nCarmen was shaking all over, trying to keep her teeth from chattering, from \nmaking more noise that might further disturb this presence in her room. \n[Whispers begin] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nShe did not sleep. And her flatmate did not move. And as the night passed, she \ncould have sworn she heard the faintest snicker drifting from nearby windows. \n[Transitions to a cabinet opening, and a bathroom tap running, \nfollowed by brief teeth brushing] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nThe sun came up gradually, bathing everything in the harshest of lights, every \npavement crack revealed, every broken window or poorly painted façade laid \nbare for all to see. Carmen stared at her face in the mirror, the glow of \nmorning reflecting back the bruised and puffy bags under her eyelids, the \nwrinkles that seemed to deepen every day… how many days now… and the \npale weariness that almost leaked from her skin. She tried to force a smile, but \nher reflection just stared at her, well aware that it was false. \n[Footsteps] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nBehind her, she saw the face of her flatmate, that same expression that \ndropped a hot coal of anxiety into her stomach. \n‘I am waiting for the bathroom,’ the flatmate said. ‘This is not acceptable.’ \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 188 – Centre of Attention \n \n15 \nBile rose from Carmen’s throat for just a second as the flatmate took a step \ncloser, watching her every move, examining her for imperfections, for failures. \nAnd there were so many. \n[Bare feet on wood as Carmen runs into her room, slamming the \ndoor; she starts searching her wardrobe] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nCarmen pushed past her, out of the bathroom, and ran back to her room, \nwhere she tried to find clothes for the day, but everything in her wardrobe was \nfit only to draw attention to her. She so desperately wanted to simply \ndisappear, just for a moment. \n[Transitions to a door being shut and locked; fluorescent light \nhums; a camera iris movement] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nA camera swivelled to focus on her the moment she left her flat, stepping onto \nthe landing, lens extending towards her, right at eye level. She instinctively \nswatted at it, batting it away. \n[Wet crunching impact] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nIt was softer than she expected, and warmer, impacting the wall with a gentle \npop, and leaving a sticky grey residue behind it. Carmen hurried down the \nstairs as the other cameras all focused on her, and the other doors on the floor \nbegan to open to see what all the fuss was about. \n[Hurried footsteps on concrete; cameras iris, doors creak open]", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 3, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 3389}}
