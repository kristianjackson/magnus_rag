None of them made a sound, though I could feel a warmth and \nshuddering below my feet, as though the earth itself was screaming. \nWithout warning one of their heads snapped towards me. It was a young \nwoman who had lived the next road over, and whose name I had never \nlearned. She stared at me, eyes suddenly alive with terror, and began to \nscream. The instant she did, she disappeared, pulled into the ground, cutting \nthe sound off before it had even begun. I turned and ran, back to the house. I \nwanted to drive away, but I couldn’t bear to be outside. So I hid, under my bed \nthe rest of the night, and felt the ground rock gently beneath me. \n\nI don’t know if Tommy returned the next day. As soon as it was light outside, I \nleapt into my car, and began to drive away. I tried to, at least. I didn’t want to \nsee the pit again, I really didn’t. But I did. It was empty, as before, like the \nprevious night had never happened. But it was bigger. And the road had \nswelled to encompass it. There was someone else looking at it, though. An \nelderly woman, face pinched and thoughtful, stood at the edge looking down. I \ndidn’t recognise her, or the car she stood next to. She definitely wasn’t from \nBucoda. Sat in the car next to her, I could see a young man who had clearly \nbeen crying. I couldn’t get over how blue his eyes were. The old woman caught \nmy eye, and looked from me, to the pit, and back again. I thought about saying \nsomething when she gestured for me to leave, and I did. I decided that I was \nno part of whatever was happening, so I drove away, and didn’t look back. \nThat night, the earthquake struck that destroyed Bucoda entirely, so I guess I’ll \nnever know what was going on. And honestly? I’m glad. \nARCHIVIST \nStatement ends. \nWhy has Elias sent me this statement? It took place the other side of the \nworld, to people who don’t seem to have any connection with what’s going on. \nI’ve suspected for a while there may be some power concerned with caves and \nenclosed spaces, being buried alive or crushed. So I suppose it’s nice to get a \nstatement that goes some way to developing that theory, but… I cannot figure \nout what it has to do with our current situation. Is it the nameless old man? \nThe old woman? Or whoever was crying in the car? Is he trying to warn me not \nto ignore my own metaphorical pit, because if so, what is my metaphorical pit? \nYou know, it’s somehow worse, now that I know I can ask why he’s sending me \nthese statements, but that he still won’t… tell me. I did my follow-up. Mr. Ellis \nis still alive and well, currently living in Tacoma, and unwilling to discuss these \nevents any further. The town of Bucoda itself is... \nWell, it’s… gone. Newspapers reported it as an earthquake, and tremors were \nfelt as far away as Castle Rock, but despite every article describing Bucoda as \nhaving been “destroyed” by the earthquake, there are no pictures or records \nof the destruction itself. No damage seems to have \n\noccurred outside of town limits, and all the roads in the area seem unaffected, \ndespite there being no evidence of rebuilding works taking place after the \nevent. As far as I can tell, there was an earthquake, and then Bucoda wasn’t \nthere, but aside from these two detail— \n[The sounds of the lights going out.] \nOh. (Sigh) Alright, let’s.... \n[The lightswitch is flicked on and off a few times.] \nGeorgie, where’s your fusebo—? \nRight. Right. Keep saying it’s not meant to trip whenever one bulb goes, but \n“No, John, I don’t want to bother the landlord.” (Sighs.) Ah. \nORSINOV \n(Sing-song) You don’t want to do that. \n(The Archivist gasps.) \nORSINOV \nI mean, you can if you really want to, but you’re not going to like it. Sometimes \nnot being able to see something is actually quite a good thing. \nARCHIVIST \nWho are you? \nORSINOV \nWell, my father called me Nikola, and then I killed him, so I thought I rather \ndeserved to have his second name too. Which makes me Nikola Orsinov. \nPleased to meet you at last. \nARCHIVIST \nYou, um... You killed Gregor Orsinov? \nORSINOV", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 6, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 4096}}
