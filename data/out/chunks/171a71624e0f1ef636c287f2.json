I was fascinated – I knew my \nlocal history well enough and certainly was not aware of any noble of the \nWürttemberg line named Johann. I was sure he had never been a count or a \nprince. More than that, there had never been, as far as I could recall, any town \nor settlement near this spot that could have supported a cemetery of such size. \nSo who was Johann von Württemberg, and why had he built a mausoleum \nhere, in the middle of the Schwarzwald, six miles or more from Schramberg? \nI had no time to investigate any further, for I realised that I needed to leave \nimmediately if I was to return to my wife and nephew before sundown. I \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG023 – Schwartzwald \n6 \n \nturned away and followed my path back as quickly as I dared. While I would \nnormally be satisfied forging a new path the next day, something in the \nthought of that silent tomb drew me back, and I found myself marking trees \nwith my pocket knife, to make my finding my way back the following day that \nmuch easier. \nI asked Wilhelm that evening over dinner whether he had ever heard of Johann \nvon Württemberg, or was aware of the mausoleum a few north miles from his \nhome. He told me no to both – he rarely spent time in the forest around save \nfor hunting, and the hunting was usually poor in the north, as the trees were \ntoo close together to easily navigate with a horse. And he had never heard of \nthis ‘Johann’. I made some inquiries as to where I could look further into the \nhistory of the area, but there was no library of a decent size within near \ndistance of Schramberg, and as I mentioned, Wilhelm had little in the way of \nbooks, so I let the matter drop. \nNothing else of note occurred that night, and so, making my apologies the next \nmorning, I headed out early towards the old cemetery. I made no secret of my \ndestination, and even offered the opportunity to accompany me to both \nWilhelm and Carla, but neither saw the trip as worth the cold hours it would \ntake to reach. So it was alone that I once again made my way to that forgotten \nplace. My marking the trees had proven unnecessary, as there had been no \nfresh snowfall the previous night, and my footprints from the day before were \nstill clear and very easy to follow. \nThe mausoleum looked exactly as I had left it, its door still yawning, and the \nsunlight seemed to make it very little distance over the threshold before \ndarkness once again swallowed it. I had foreseen this, and packed a lantern for \nthe purpose of exploring the place. I was about to light it, when I noticed a \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG023 – Schwartzwald \n7 \n \nfigure watching me from the treeline. Perhaps this place was not so forgotten \nafter all. I had heard tales of brigands using places such as this for assignations, \nand was suddenly glad I had also thought to pack a pistol and shot. I \napproached the man, but he didn’t move to flee. As I got closer, I saw him in \nmore detail. He was short and squat, wearing an old-fashioned, black frock \ncoat and knee breeches, though his head was shadowed by a wide-brimmed \nblack hat. By his costume, I assumed him to be an old man, perhaps a \ngroundskeeper for this place, or simply a recluse that lived nearby. When I \ngreeted him, though, the voice that answered held no quiver of age within it. \nHe asked me, in low, peasant German whether I was planning to explore the \ntomb. I said I was, and asked if he was the keeper of this place. He laughed at \nthat, a sharp, guttural exclamation that surprised me, and told me that the \ncrypt I sought was a dangerous place. I asked him what I had to fear from the \ndead, and he stared at me. I could not see his eyes beneath the brim of his hat, \nbut I could still feel his gaze upon me. He laughed again, and told me, “No, sir, \nyou have nothing to fear from the dead.” \nAt these words I began to back away, ensuring my hand was on my pistol, not \ntaking my eyes off this strange man until I reached the edge of the mausoleum. \nOnly then did I look down to make sure my lantern was where I left it, and \nwhen I returned my gaze to the trees, he was gone. To speak plainly I was \nrather shaken by my encounter, and considered turning back and trying my \nluck another day, but something within me balked at having all my work and \npreparation be for naught because of a single farmer who couldn’t mind his \nbusiness. I lit my lantern, and… \nJONATHAN SIMS", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 3, "chunk_count": 10, "chars": 4458}}
