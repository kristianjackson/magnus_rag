He talks to you for five minutes and suddenly \nyou're back on your feet and, bouncing around like a, like a spring chicken! \nARCHIVIST \n(Laughing) I mean, that's really not— \nMARTIN \nI mean, what's so special about him, that you wake up for him and not me, \nhm? Enlighten me. \nARCHIVIST \nI mean, that's… that's not really how it worked. It-It wasn't— \nLook. Martin, I'm sorry you feel that way, but I'm not going to kill a man just \nbecause you're jealous. \nMARTIN \nWhy not?! \n(Beat) \nYeah. Yeah, I know, I know, I know. (small sigh) \n(Beat) \nPlease? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 168 – Roots \n9 \n(The Archivist snickers) \nARCHIVIST \nWho knows. Maybe he'll try to stop us getting through the routes, and I'll have \nto. \nMARTIN \nMm. \nARCHIVIST \nBut I'm not going to… seek him out. At the very least he's earned not having \nme hunt him down. \nMARTIN \nFine. I suppose that's… reasonable. \nARCHIVIST \nNow, if you're, quite done inciting me to murder? \nMARTIN \nNot murder! Smiting. \n(The Archivist sighs heavily) \nRight, yes, yes, of course. You— (inhale) you vomit your horrors. \n(The Archivist makes a very disgusted sound) \nARCHIVIST \nOh- I don’t, I'm not sure (small laugh) I like that metaphor. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 168 – Roots \n10 \nMARTIN \nPuke your terrors? \nARCHIVIST \nJust go. \nMARTIN \nAlright! Alright, I'm going. \n[Martin walks away] \n(The Archivist chuckles fondly then sighs heavily) \n[Hissing static starts] \n [The whispers and wooden creaks of the corpse roots continue] \nARCHIVIST \nReport to prevent future deaths. \nThis report is being sent to: \n[Hissing static ends] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nThe great Eye that watches all who linger in terror and gorges itself on the \nsufferings of those under its unrelenting, stuporous gaze. And its archive, \nwhich draws knowledge of this suffering unto itself. \nOne: Coroner. \nI am Oliver Banks, sometimes known as Antonio Blake or Doctor Thomas \nPritchard. I serve the coming End that waits for all and will not be ignored. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 168 – Roots \n11 \nTwo: Coroner's legal powers. \nI make this report under no authority, no regulation or act of law save the \nhollow power and grim responsibility given me by the Termination of All Life. \nWith it, I may see and spread the hidden veins of destiny that wrap us close \nand draw us through the empty, yearning parody of meaning that we call life, \nknowing at all stages that the last and final point of this journey is a blank and \nfutile end. I have no power to stop it, and even if I did, I would not do so. For to \nrob a soul of death is as torturous as its inevitable coming. \nThree: Investigation and inquest. \nOn the first and last day of the age of the Beholding, I begin my vigil into the \ndoom of Danika Gelsthorpe. She was, at the time of the change, thirty-four \nyears of age, and found herself within my domain, traveling slowly and \nunremittingly along the length of the stretching corpse roots. She is one of \nmany thousands, neither remarkable nor unique in her background or \ndestination. She has spent the last twenty of those years acutely aware and in \nconstant dread of a death she believed to be imminent. \nThe earliest she can remember being certain that she was about to die was \nwhen, at the age of fifteen due to a chronic case of acid reflux, she decided \nthat she had a malignant intestinal tumour. She would spend whole nights \nlying awake, imagining it lurking there, growing. Spreading. Blocking her organs \nand preparing to kill her. Danika knew the whole thing was ridiculous, of \ncourse, and did not visit a doctor about it, simply assuming it would be \ndiscovered when she finally collapsed. She diagnosed herself with a year to \nlive, at most.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 1, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 3844}}
