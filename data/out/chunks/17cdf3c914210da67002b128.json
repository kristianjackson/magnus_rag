The Magnus Archives. Episode one hundred and fifty-\neight: \"Panopticon.\" \n[Theme finishes] \n[Tape click on] \n[Footsteps as Peter and Martin walk in an echoing tunnel] \n[Faint sound of the Lonely (Peter’s) static] \n[They stop walking] \n(Martin makes an agitated sound) \nPETER \nIs everything alright, Martin? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 158 – Panopticon \n \n2 \nMARTIN \nIt's fine. Don't particularly like it down here. \nPETER \nAh, yes, of course. Hard to trust the doors, I imagine. \nMARTIN \n(Wry chuckle) Yeah, well, everyone else seems to these days, so... \nPETER \nBut she's still the same corridors, I suppose. I'm sure... what was his name... \nTim! Tim w— \nMARTIN \n(Interrupting) I would really. Rather not talk about it, Peter. \nPETER \nVery well. This way. \n[They start walking again] \n(Beat) \nMARTIN \nLook, are you sure about that map? I'm pretty certain the tunnels change. \nPETER \nOh, don't worry about that. Ink's practically still wet. Not to mention, if they do \nchange, well... I happen to have something that will change them back. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 158 – Panopticon \n \n3 \n[Rustling] \nMARTIN \nThat's a Leitner. \nPETER \nIt is! \nMARTIN \nAnd the, um... the blood on it? \nPETER \n(Cheerfully) That's Leitner too! \nMARTIN \n(Apprehensively) ...Riiight. \nPETER \nDo you want to see how it works? \nMARTIN \nNo, no, I'd really rather you didn't— \nPETER \nNo, I insist! Watch. \n[They stop walking] \n(Long beat with no additional sounds) \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 158 – Panopticon \n \n4 \nMARTIN \n(Wryly sarcastic) Very impressive. \nPETER \nI'm reading. Shush. \n(Beat) \n[Faint stone sliding and brick movement that gets louder] \nMARTIN \nP-Peter. Peter, there's a... Peter, I think there's something in there. \nPETER \nMm-hmm. I'd stay quiet if I were you. \n[The stone and bricks movement crescendos with rubble going \neverywhere as Not-Sasha is released] \n(Not-Sasha enters with a distorted scream then some ragged gasps; its voice \nis distorted through the rest of the episode) \nNOT-SASHA \nSo you finally decided to let me out, John? (Calling) Jooooohn? \n(Beat) \nWho's there? \n(Martin's terrified breathing can be heard) \nWho let me out? \nDon't be shy... I just want to say thank you. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 158 – Panopticon \n \n5 \n(Beat) \n...alright, have it your way. Now if you'll excuse me... I have some unfinished \nbusiness. \n(Not-Sasha lets out a cackling laugh) \n[Not-Sasha leaves with a scuttling sound] \n(Beat) \n(Martin lets out a shaky breath) \nMARTIN \nThat — that — that — that was. Um— \nPETER \nYes! \nMARTIN \nAnd it's, it’s going to— \nPETER \nMake sure everyone is too busy to follow us. They'll be fine. Probably. \nYou could still go help them. If you insist. \n(Beat) \n(Martin lets out a resigned breath) \n(Satisfied) Very good. Come on. \n[Tape clicks off] \n[Tape clicks on] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 158 – Panopticon \n \n6 \n[A quiet room] \nARCHIVIST \nGone how? \nDAISY \nJust walked out, as far as we can tell. \nBASIRA \nA couple of guards on duty vanished too. \nARCHIVIST \n(Agitated) Vanished. How?! \nBASIRA \nJust left. Best we can tell, he had some dirt on them. \nDAISY \nOld friend at the prison let us know. \nARCHIVIST \nWhat, and no one thought of that? \nBASIRA \nAsshole could have left at any time, but he just sat there laughing at us. \nARCHIVIST \nNo, no, this— this can't be a coincidence. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 158 – Panopticon \n \n7 \nBASIRA \nCoincidence with what? \nARCHIVIST \n(Sputters) Martin, or someone, left me a tape. Him and Peter Lukas are looking \nfor something d-down in the tunnels. \nBASIRA \nDo you know what? \nARCHIVIST \nNo, he called it a device. \nDAISY \nWhen? \nARCHIVIST \nI-I mean, I don't— I mean... n-now? I guess? They could— it can't be a \ncoincidence that this is when Elias chooses to make a break for it. \nBASIRA \nYou think he's coming here? \nARCHIVIST \nYou don't? \nDAISY \nLet's go.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 0, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 4139}}
