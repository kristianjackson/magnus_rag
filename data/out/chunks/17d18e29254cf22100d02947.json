The \nsacrifices made to birth the dark star that would make it all possible? It was to \nbe a week of night and horror, culminating in the eclipse that passed over Ny-\nÅlesund on the 20th March 2015, almost 300 years after Halley’s eclipse \npassed over London. We had hundreds of sacrifices prepared and ready, \nplunged into darkness and terror for days on end, all prepared to culminate in \nthe unveiling of that point of purest night at the moment of the eclipse’s \nheight. It would open the door to a world of true and holy darkness, extinguish \nthe sun and take us to a place where we would be redeemed of our base and \ncorrupt need for light and warmth. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 143 – Heart of Darkness \n \n8 \n \nMaxwell was here, with me, prepared for our moment of triumph, and our \nchurches around the world were ready, in those lost and forgotten places of \nworship shut up and left in shadow. Hither Green was, I believe, where your \ninstitute was watching, but Natalie’s efforts were a small and meagre part of \nthe greater effort. When they collapsed, it was as nothing to the grand ritual, \nthough perhaps we should have seen it as the first sign of what was happening. \nBut we had no idea. \nTo begin our seven-day feast, we slew the still and lightless beast and drank of \nits stagnant blood, submerging the first of the sacrifices in the brackish water it \nhad blessed with its stillness. Maxwell plunged its claws into his chest, freeing \nthe darkness within him, and we waited, and we sang, and we exalted in divine \nstillness. The darkness was beyond anything that could be imagined, and even \nin my wildest experimentations in the void of space, I could not have believed \nsuch a peace was possible as I felt in the quiet whimpering terror of that place. \nThe sky was light, but we were well protected, and we knew that when the sun \nwas swallowed in eclipse the darkness would be complete. \nWe believed it far too late for anyone to stop us, and the crude methods of \nyour Archivist least of all. The death of a few have never been more than an \ninconvenience, and that’s all she was ever really capable of. You were not the \nfirst to try and stop us, you know, not even within living memory. I was but \nnewly joined when Lynette fled the church and Maxwell had her silenced, but I \nremember her brute of a husband. He fed the beast for us, you know, when \nfirst he believed Lynette might still be saved, then later we faithful served as \nhis fuel to banish it. But not for long. That’s the thing about darkness, isn’t it? \nYou try your hardest to eradicate, flood your surroundings with light, but it’s \nalways there at the edges, waiting for the glow to weaken, to return and cover", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 1, "chunk_count": 5, "chars": 2741}}
