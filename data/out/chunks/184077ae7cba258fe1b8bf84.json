I just feel it’s only fair to wait for your \ncolleagues, John. They’ll want to hear this too. Uh, it’s also very important to \nme, in a personal capacity, that you understand I’m answering you of my own \nfree will. \nARCHIVIST \nI don’t care! \nELIAS \nI know, but I do. There’s so much of this place, of ourselves, twisted by forces \nfar beyond us. I just wanted you to know – \n[The door opens again] \nMARTIN \nUh, okay, okay, so I’ve got everyone, but I’m honestly kind of lost as to what’s \nhappening. \nTIM \nYeah, I… Oh, Christ, what is it now? \nMELANIE \nEr, yeah, same question, please. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG092 – Nothing Beside Remains \n9 \n \nARCHIVIST \nElias here is about to confess his crimes. \nTIM \nWhat? \nMELANIE \nOh. Good? \nMARTIN \nIs, is that like, er… \nELIAS \nYes, I was just saying to John. It’s very important to me you understand that no \naction I have taken has been controlled. I have done everything because I \nwished to. \nDAISY \nGet to the point. \nELIAS \n(Sighs) Of course, Detective. So. For the avoidance of any doubt. I killed \nGertrude Robinson because she intended to destroy the Archives. And I killed \nJurgen Leitner because he was… an unnecessary complication. Likely to tell \nJohn too much, too early. \nMELANIE \nBloody hell! \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG092 – Nothing Beside Remains \n10 \n \nTIM \nOh, no. \nMARTIN \nSo-So-S-Sorry, that guy was Jurgen Leitner? \nELIAS \nIt was. \nBASIRA \nDaisy, where do I know that name from? \nDAISY \nOh, the Yousuf case. An Introduction to Higher Anatomy. \nBASIRA \nAh… Oh, god! And you killed him? You sure we shouldn’t be giving him a \nmedal? \nARCHIVIST \nVery sure. \nMARTIN \nAnd Sasha? Did you kill her too? \nARCHIVIST \nSasha died almost a year ago, Martin. \nMARTIN \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG092 – Nothing Beside Remains \n11 \n \nWh-What? \nTIM \nOh, god. \nARCHIVIST \nWhen Prentiss attacked, something else, it… it… it replaced her. I still don’t \nknow how, but – \nTIM \nGoddamn it! This is… \nMARTIN \nIt wasn’t… Sasha? \nELIAS \nHe’s right, Martin. The thing you remember as Sasha was nothing like her. It \ntoyed with your memory. If I showed you a picture of the real Sasha now, \nyou’d have no idea who it was. \nMARTIN \nSo that thing we saw…? \nELIAS \nPrecisely. It finally tried to kill John. Then Leitner killed it. Then I killed Leitner. \nAnd I believe that brings us up to date. More or less. \nARCHIVIST \nWhat about Michael? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG092 – Nothing Beside Remains \n12 \n \nELIAS \nWhat about him? An irritant. Interfering because he’s bored, and he resents \nus. He has no purpose – \nDAISY \nRight. That’s enough for me. Even got it on tape. \nEveryone get back. \n[Daisy pulls out her gun.] \nMARTIN \nWhat? \nBASIRA \nDaisy, wait. \nDAISY \nOut the way. \nMELANIE \nNow hang, hang on, I thought you were about to arrest him. \nDAISY \nGet out the way! \nMARTIN \nJohn, do something! \n[There’s a buzz – an intercom] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG092 – Nothing Beside Remains \n13 \n \nDAISY \nDon’t. \nELIAS \nExcuse me. \n[Elias answers the intercom.] \nYes? \nROSIE \nElias, there are some police officers here to see you? \nELIAS \nAh, yes, thank you Rosie. Er, could you ask them to wait a minute or two? \nROSIE \nYep, will do. \nELIAS \nThere. That should make it even easier for you. Right, Detective? I know you \nwere planning to kill me, but surely an arrest is a consolation prize? \nBASIRA \nDaisy? \nELIAS \nOh, didn’t she tell you why she hadn’t gone back to the station?", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 2, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 3528}}
