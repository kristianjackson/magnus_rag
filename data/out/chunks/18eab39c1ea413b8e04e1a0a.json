He ultimately decides that, if all the millions upon \nmillions of factors and influences that weigh upon our choices were fully and \ncompletely known, then all could be foreseen and predetermined. But, he \nargues, it is quite impossible for the human mind to comprehend even a \nfraction of these, and in that vast, dark space of ignorance lies ‘free will’. Isn’t \nthat marvellous, John? Free will is simply ignorance. It’s just the name we give \nto the fact that no-one can ever really see everything that controls them. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 147 – Weaver \n \n11 \n \nOf course, that’s not the real crux of the free will question that’s bothering you \nat the moment, is it? I think that one probably comes down to whether or not \nyou’re choosing to continue reading this statement out loud. You didn’t mean \nto, did you? No, I’m sure you told Basira and Melanie that you were going to \nglance it over and report back. Perhaps they asked you if you were going to \nrecord it and you shook your head. “Maybe later.” That sounds like the sort of \nthing you’d say. But think about it, John, when’s the last time you were able to \nread a statement quietly to yourself without instinctively hitting record and \nspeaking it aloud? Is it just instinct, habit? Or is it a compulsion, a string pulled \nby the Ceaseless Watcher or the Mother-of-Puppets? Or both? I know the \nsummaries have started to confuse you. Where do they come from when you \nread a statement afresh? How do you just sort of know what it’s about before \nyou even start to read it? But by then, you’re away, the rollercoaster is \ndropping and you’ve no real choice but to hold on and hope that I don’t crash \nyou. \nI’m afraid I don’t actually have these answers for you. I’ve simply been \nwatching. I’m sure you understand that. Maybe I’ve occasionally been nudging \nsomething here and there to keep you safe, to keep everything on track. But I \nknow you’ve been more worried about your choices, about whether you’re \nbeing controlled by me or by the Mother. So, I thought perhaps I should leave \na little something to reassure you that, yes, your actions and your choices have \nall been your own. Have they been controlled? No more than gravity controls \nyou when you walk, or hunger controls you when you choose your meal. There \nare certainly new forces, new instincts and desires that influence you and \nshape your actions. Perhaps you’re unprepared for them, but if you choose to \nbelieve in free will, then yes, all you have done has been of your own free will. \nThey have all been your choices.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 2, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 2738}}
