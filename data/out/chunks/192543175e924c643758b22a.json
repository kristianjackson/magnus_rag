I asked him if I could see him, and the doctor \nconsented, though he warned me that Wilfred hadn’t said a word since he’d \nbeen brought in. \nAs soon as I stepped inside the medical tent I was overwhelmed by the sweet \nscent of decaying flesh and the moans of pain and despair. The sharp smell of \nthe disinfectant brought back unpleasant memories of chlorine gas attacks. \nStill, I eventually found my way over to Wilfred’s bed and, sure enough, there \nhe was, staring silently out at the world, though with an intensity that alarmed \nme. I followed his gaze to a bed nearby, and there I saw a private I didn’t \nrecognise. His forehead was slick with sweat and his chest rose and fell quickly, \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG00X – The Piper \n7 \n \nthen abruptly stopped. I realised with a start that a man had just died, and \nnobody had noticed except Wilfred. \nI tried to engage him in conversation, rattled off a few meaningless \npleasantries. “How are you doing, old man?” “Heard you had a bit of close \ncall.” “Glad you found yourself a crump-hole.” All that sort of nonsense. None \nof it seemed to produce any reaction in him, and instead he turned to me and \nafter a long while he simply said: “I met the war.” I told him that he certainly \nhad, not many walk away from something like that and lying in that hole for so \nlong, surrounded by all the death… Well, he had definitely met the war and it \nwas rotten bloody business. But Wilfred just shook his head like I didn’t \nunderstand, and to be honest I was starting to feel like I didn’t, and he told me \nagain that he “met the war”. He said it was no taller than I was. It struck me \nthat perhaps he was describing some dreadful mirage that had come upon him \nas he lay in that wretched place, and I asked him to tell me what the war \nlooked like. \nI remember exactly what he said. He told me it had three faces. One to play its \npipes of scrimshawed bone, one to scream its dying battle cry and one that \nwould not open its mouth, for when it did blood and sodden soil flowed out \nlike a waterfall. Those arms that did not play the pipes were gripping blades \nand guns and spears, while others raised their hands in futile supplication of \nmercy, and one in a crisp salute. It wore a tattered coat of wool, olive green \nwhere it was not stained black, and beneath, nothing could be seen but a body \nbeaten, slashed and shot and until nothing remained but the wounds \nthemselves. \nI had heard quite enough by this point, and said so to Wilfred, but if he heard \nme he gave no indication of it. He told me that the war, “the Piper”, had come \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG00X – The Piper \n8 \n \nto claim him, and he had begged to remain. The thing had paused its tune for \nbut a moment, and with one of its arms it reached out and handed him a pen. \nHe said he knew it would return for him someday, but now he too would live \nto play its tune. The way he looked at me at that moment was the same way \nhe’d looked at me before the shell hit, and for a moment I could have sworn I \nonce again heard that music on the breeze. \nI left almost immediately after that, and was later told that he’d been shipped \nback to Britain, to recuperate at Craiglockhart. The other men grumbled about \nofficers’ perks and a nice holiday for the Lieutenant, but they didn’t know what \nhe’d been through, and I found it very hard to envy him myself. At one point I \nasked some of the squad who brought him back whether he’d been holding a \npen when they found him, but they told me he hadn’t. The only thing they’d \nfound nearby were the tags of the dead man among his remains. A man named \nJoseph Rayner. And for a long while that was that. Wilfred was back at home \nrecovering and taking on lighter duties, while I slogged on through the mud of \nFlanders. I had a few close calls myself – including the flamethrower that \nmarked me so distinctively. Could have been worse, of course; if the rain \nhadn’t almost liquefied the mud of no man’s land I’d have gone up like a \nlucifer. I did start to notice something among the troops, though. Every time \nwe lined up to go over the top I would watch them, look into their faces. Most \nof them showed naught but the starkest fear, of course, but a few of them \nseemed distant. The whistle would startle them back to themselves and with \nwide eyes they would surge forward. I had seen this before all that business \nwith Wilfred but had always assumed it was simply the mind trying to choke \ndown the likelihood of its", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 4, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 4499}}
