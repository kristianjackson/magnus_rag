If you ever wish to escape \nyour pursuing guilt, there are few places so apt to hide it as a land devastated \nby unimaginable war. At least I shall not go hungry. I lost that particular moral \nqualm in Anqing. I believe thirty-eight fen was the going price for a pound of \nhuman meat by the end of the siege. Such a profound will to survive. In the \nend, it did no good. Zeng Guofan’s army breached the gates, and they put \neveryone inside to death. Sixteen thousand more corpses, soldier and civilian \nalike. \n\nThere’s no difference anymore. Hide your hair braid beneath your hat, \nproclaim your allegiance until you have no breath left, compared to the danger \nof enemy spies or saboteurs, one more cadaver is nothing. \nI’m lucky I still had my British uniform. Almost twenty years lost and \nabandoned in this country, a prisoner of the very opium I helped to force upon \nits people; I barely recognised myself putting it on. I’m lucky I never thought to \nsell it. It was an old design, a long way from the uniforms I see among my old \ncomrades today, but it served well enough to get me through the Qing forces \nas they stormed through the streets. I am lucky, I suppose, that the only ghosts \nthat chose to follow me were the ones I had to kill as I fled the city. I know \nthere are others that see those behind me, and sixteen thousand lonely souls \nwould be too much for them, I’m sure. They would be too much for me, but \nI’m not sure what that means anymore. \nAfter the fall of Anqing, I wandered this desolate country, though for how long \nI do not know. Days went by with not a single living creature to be seen, and \nonly the dead for company. Yellow reeds and white bones. It struck me then \nhow few of the fallen had died by the hand of another. War kills just as surely \nwith hunger and sickness, and for every one bloodied and murdered, there \nwere ten wasted to nothing or black with disease and rot. I suppose there must \nhave been a terrible smell, but there is nowhere here the wind does not chase \nme with that scent, and I can no longer tell the stench of decay from the air \nitself. They are one and the same. \nSome months ago, I was captured. Not by the Taiping or the Imperial forces, at \nleast they weren’t anymore. I believe they were once peasants, they had \nclearly never owned the building in which they kept me. There were three of \nthem; one tall, who clearly spoke for his companions, one walking with a \n\nnoticeable limp and an eye that refused to stop watering, and a third, whose \nright arm was so discoloured from a spreading infection, that he looked at me \nwith a mixture of hate and helpless terror, as though I could do something to \nfix it. I did not fight when they barred my way with crude weapons levelled, \nand demanded my surrender. I have not fought since I left Anqing, and saw the \ntrue scale of the devastation. \nBelieving me to still be a British officer, they intended, it seemed, to ransom \nme, but they knew of no British forces in the area, so were arguing as to \nwhether to offer me to the Qing army or the nearest rebels. The tall one was \nadamant that the Imperial Army, now allied with the British, would pay them \nfor my safe return, while the limping man was horrified at the thought. He had \ncut off his braid, he kept saying, and they would think he was loyal to the \nTaiping. The third man just watched me, listening to his companions arguing, \nand laughing softly whenever they mentioned money. I believe that he was the \nonly one who truly understood. When the dead that follow caught up with me, \nthey broke those poor fools apart like twigs, and dragged all three of them \nbelow the ground. And they were gone. I found water among their possessions \nand a small bag of rotten rice, and relishing the chance to wash the taste of \nblood from my mouth, I ate. I could still hear my would-be captors’ voices, and \nI wondered how long it would be that I still had to wait for death. \nSome choose not to wait, of course. I passed by the city of Hangzhou after it \nhad fallen to the Taiping. The gate still stood open, as they were unable to \nclose it for the dead. When the city was taken, the people had rushed out and \nthrown themselves bodily into the West Lake. It was solid with them.
