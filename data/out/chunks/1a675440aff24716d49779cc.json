Um, uh, sorry. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 171 – The Gardener \n16 \nMARTIN \nNo— it’s-it’s alright. \nJARED \nIs it really that bad? Seeing what I've done here? Or, heh, is it maybe that deep \ndown, you think it's as beautiful as I do? \nARCHIVIST \nShut up! \nJARED \nIt's a shame. Who's gonna look after the garden when I'm gone? There are a \nfew real pretty ones. \nWho knows. Maybe they'll uproot and start landscaping themselves. That'd be \nnice. Then again, maybe it'll just grow wild. \nARCHIVIST \nI don't. Care. \nJARED \nNo. You don't, do you? \nARCHIVIST \nI can't. There's too many. I can't save everyone. Huh, I c— I can't save anyone. \nJARED \nIf you say so. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 171 – The Gardener \n17 \nSo. I guess that just leaves revenge, then, don't it? Can't say I blame ya. That's \nall life is, really, innit? Just people using each other up. \nARCHIVIST \n(Snide) Spare me the crude philosophy. \nJARED \nGrow well, my darlings. Grow well. \n[Hissing static begins to build alongside unpleasant electronic high \ntones and glitching — the ‘smite static’ from the Not-Sasha \nencounter] \nARCHIVIST \nFeel it. \nFeel all the terror and despair as your garden grows. \n[Jared’s body cracks and squishes, his footsteps stamp, as he \nsquares up for his end, growling continuously] \nARCHIVIST (CONT'D) \nLet it flow through you and blossom. \nJust people, using each other up. Ceaseless Watcher, turn your gaze upon this \nthing and drink. Your. Fill. \n[The ‘smite static’ crescendos to a loud digital glitching sound] \n(Jared’s deep, low growling echoes and fades away) \n(The Archivist takes a few gasps of breath) \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 171 – The Gardener \n18 \n[The statics, tones and glitches — the ‘smite statics’ — fade away \nquickly] \n[The sounds of the garden, flesh and bone noises continue, with \nsome whimpering and groan of victims] \nMARTIN \n(Worried) John? \nARCHIVIST \nI'm here. \nMARTIN \nAre you okay? \nARCHIVIST \nI'm… (bitter) great. You? \nMARTIN \n(Slight laugh) I really thought this one would be messier. \nARCHIVIST \nWhat do you mean? \nMARTIN \nWell I mean, he's a Flesh… thing, right? I thought he'd be all meat and blood \nand gore and all that. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 171 – The Gardener \n19 \nARCHIVIST \n(Slight laugh) Apparently not. \nMARTIN \nHe didn't even put up a fight. \nARCHIVIST \nNo. \n(Beat) \nMARTIN \n(Sighing) So what now? \nARCHIVIST \nCarry on, I guess. \nMARTIN \nYeah. \n[The Archivist turns to walk away] \nMARTIN (CONT'D) \nJohn! \nARCHIVIST \nHmm? \nMARTIN \nI need to ask you something. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 171 – The Gardener \n20 \nARCHIVIST \nOkay. \nMARTIN \nI meant to ask. A-after the fire, actually? But, well, then there was the house \nand everything, and it just sort of— \nARCHIVIST \nWhat is it, Martin. \nMARTIN \nWhy didn't we go after the landlord guy? In the tenement? \nARCHIVIST \nArthur Nolan? \nMARTIN \nYeah. He's still there, right? \nARCHIVIST \n(Sighing) After Jude, the, the fires, I-I didn't want to put you through anymore. \nMARTIN \n(sigh) Don't do that. \nARCHIVIST \nWhat? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 171 – The Gardener \n21 \nMARTIN \nDon't use me as an excuse. \nARCHIVIST \nI-I'm not. I just… It didn't seem worth it. I didn't, hate him like I hated her. \nHe never hurt me. \nMARTIN \nBut all the people inside. \nARCHIVIST \nKilling Nolan wouldn't have made it stop. It would just leave it… unsupervised. \nMARTIN \nHmm. \n(Beat) \n(Sighs) John, we are, doing good, right? Making things better? \nARCHIVIST \nI don't know if that was ever an option. \n[Tape clicks off] \n[The Magnus Archives Theme – Outro] \nJONATHAN SIMS \nThe Magnus Archives is a podcast distributed by Rusty Quill, and licensed \nunder a Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial ShareAlike 4.0 \nInternational Licence.
