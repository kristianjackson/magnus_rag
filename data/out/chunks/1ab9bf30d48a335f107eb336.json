It was the happiest I’d ever been. \n \nSince then, travel has always been my main joy in life. I got out of university \nwith a good maths degree and got a job as a programmer. It’s a life of well-paid \ndrudgery, but I don’t care, because it means once or twice a year I can drop \neverything for a month and disappear somewhere new: the Grand Canyon, the \nForbidden City, the Great Barrier Reef. That’s my life. Everything in between is \njust the intermission. I suppose that’s one of the reasons I’ve always had such \ntrouble with romance, or even close friendships. I can never take them \nseriously, because they aren’t a part of my real life. And in my real life, I travel \nalone. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG048 – Lost in The Crowd \n3 \n \n \nI know it’s a lot more dangerous and people always tell me how lonely it must \nbe, but it really isn’t. There’s a purity to being alone when you travel. You can \nabsorb the places you find yourself in so much better, take in the sites and the \nsmells and the vibrations of a place in a way you just can’t if you have to be \nmindful of another person’s presence. It isn’t that I don’t like other people, I \ndo. I just can’t travel properly if I’m with them. \n \nFor my twenty-fifth birthday last year, I decided to treat myself to another go \nat Europe. Obviously I couldn’t do another four months, but I figured that just \nthe one would let me re-visit my favourite spots in the south: Slovenia, \nSwitzerland, Bavaria, Italy, maybe Monaco or bits of southern France. I’m \nlucky, as a September birthday makes it pretty much the perfect time for \nEuropean travel, and for the first weeks I was having a wonderful time. \nHeading down into Italy and re-visiting Venice, Rome and the beautiful views \nof San Marino. I avoided going as far south as Naples, which I recall as being a \nhorrible place, full of ugly smells and rude people, and instead began travelling \nnorth again via Florence. It was in a Florence hostel that I met Ethan Taylor. \n \nEthan was every inch the Australian traveller. Tall and tan, with slightly curly, \ndirty blonde hair and a carefree attitude. I’d met literally hundreds just like him \nin every hostel across the globe, but for some reason I really hit it off with \nEthan in a way I hadn’t with any of the others of his kind. I think it’s because \nwhen he talked about travelling, he talked about it the same way I did. He \nwasn’t going around for fun, or because that’s what every Australian does \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG048 – Lost in The Crowd \n4 \n \nwhen they reach that age; he travelled because he had to. And like me, he said, \nhe always travelled alone. We spent a few nights together in the hostel, much \nto the irritation of the other guests, but as much as I enjoyed his company, I \ndidn’t have any interest in travelling with him for long, and it seemed he felt \nthe same way. \n \nIt was with a sort of mutual unspoken discomfort that we found ourselves \nending up on the same train heading north. It seemed like it would have been \nrude not to at least acknowledge each other, so we sat in the same \ncompartment and stared out the window. It was alright actually. Each lost in \nour thoughts as the Italian countryside rolled past. \n \nWe’d been travelling for about two hours when Ethan looked over and asked \nme if I was planning to stop in Genoa. I said no, it wasn’t a place I’d really \nconsidered visiting and Ethan began to tell me about it. He’d been there a few \nyears before, he said, and the coastline was beautiful, all clear blue ocean and \nnarrow, winding lanes. I didn’t have any other plans, so I said, ‘Sure’. And you \nknow what? He was right. It was beautiful: the colourful houses climbing up \nthe steep streets from the coast and the paths beside the sea. That first day we \nstepped off the train, I fell a little bit in love with Genoa. \n \nWe checked into a hostel and, for once, decided to get a private room, and \ndropped our backpacks from tired shoulders. We didn’t need to say anything \nto know we’d be exploring the city on our own. Ethan would be re-visiting \ncherished memories and I would be discovering new ones, but neither of us", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 1, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 4155}}
