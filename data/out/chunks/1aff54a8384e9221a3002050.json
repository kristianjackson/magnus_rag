She was wearing black cargo trousers and a \ngrey T-shirt, with a light black jacket over the top. I… I thought that was a bit \noff as it was the middle of January. I mean, sure, it was a mild winter, but it’s a \nlong way from T-shirt weather. I introduced myself, but she just nodded and lit \na cigarette. I was about to say that we’d prefer she didn’t smoke in the van, \nbut she’d already opened up the back door and climbed inside, puffing away. I \nremembered Georgie’s warning that she was ‘a little bit unsocial’ and kicked \nmyself for not asking more about it. Still, she was here now, we had a sound \ntech, so we were going to be able to have an episode. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG028 – Skin Tight \n7 \n \n \nIt was about a two hour drive to the CMH. It’s down in Aldershot, in \nHampshire, and I’ve got to say that was about the longest two hours of my life. \nSarah didn’t talk much. If you asked her any questions, you’d just get a one \nword answer, and, I swear, she worked hard to find the shortest word she \ncould. She smoked constantly, so we had to ride with the windows down and \nthe van was freezing. And there was also... I don’t know. The oddest smell. It \nwas definitely Sarah. It smelled like a really bad perfume: sharp and faintly \nfloral, but not like any scent I could place. I didn’t like it, but it was hardly \nnoticeable through those damned cigarettes. I could tell Toni was having a \nhard time too. Andy seemed happy enough, but he’s one of the most laid-back \npeople I’ve ever met, so no surprise there. \n \nWe got into Aldershot about 8pm and headed toward the old hospital. It took \na bit of finding, but eventually we saw it standing there, dark and silent against \nthe night sky. It’s a pretty imposing building, the sharp-tipped clocktower \nabove the main hall. We parked a little way away, just in case there was \nsecurity that might have stumbled across the van, and walked towards it. As \nwe got closer, I noticed that Sarah was hanging back. I asked her if she was \nokay, and she just looked at me and said, “You didn’t tell me about this place.” \nThere was real anger in that voice. I was surprised, not only because that was \nthe most words I’d ever heard her strung together, but also because I’d been \nreally quite detailed about where we were going and the history of the place \nwhen I first contacted her. I said as much, but she just shook her head. I asked \nif there was going to be a problem, and she paused, lit another cigarette, and \ngave me a slow shrug. Then without a word she picked up her bag and started \nwalking towards the main building. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG028 – Skin Tight \n8 \n \nGetting inside wasn’t a problem. The ground floor windows were large, and it \nlooked like we weren’t the first trespassers wanting to get inside; a few of the \nboards covering them had been pried away already. So, we turned on our \ntorches and headed inside. \n \nNow, the particular ghost we were after that episode was a grey lady. There \nare grey ladies everywhere. I mean, it’s not like it’s an official ghost \nclassification, but if you find somewhere haunted in England, there’s a good \nchance that one or more of the ghosts will be called “The Grey Lady”. Old \nhospitals, asylums, orphanages, they’re usually believed to be the ghost of a \nnurse or something, anywhere that women had a duty. And the Cambridge \nMilitary Hospital was no exception to that. Various old tales of soldiers being \nvisited by an apparition in the night while recuperating on the ward; a few \nmembers of the public as it was opened up to the civilian population after the \nSecond World War. They are generally benign encounters, even kind, so we \nwere arguing about whether to try and angle the episode for spookiness, or try \nand build up a more emotional tale. \nSo, we started wandering round, recounting the history of the place to camera. \nWe made sure to film any bits of the building that might be creepy enough \ntwice – once with low light in the cold, stark torchlight, then switching out for \nthe warmer bulbs in case we case we wanted to use the footage for a tragedy \nangle. The builders had clearly been in already, and marked various areas with \nspray paint. It was a bit disconcerting, as the shade of red they had used kept \nmaking me think that they were blood splashes, so I was leaning towards the \n‘creepy old hospital’ angle. There was also the normal, actual graffiti, of \ncourse. Mostly the standard collection of ta", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 2, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 4500}}
