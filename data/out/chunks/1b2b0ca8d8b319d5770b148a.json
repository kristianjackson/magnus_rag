The Magnus Archives. Episode one hundred and \nseventy-one: \"The Gardener.\" \n[Theme finishes] \n[Tape clicks on] \n[Sounds of countryside birds chirping happily, a stream with deer \nchaser fountain, and distant windchimes; all intermixed with \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 171 – The Gardener \n2 \ncracking bone, wet flesh, and the groans, whimpers and cries of \npain of people] \n[Footsteps on grass as Martin and the Archivist walk] \nARCHIVIST \nDon't. Touch. Anything. \nMARTIN \nI wasn't planning to, heh. \nAre they still... alive? \nARCHIVIST \nMore or less. They're certainly still aware. But they're just the compost. The \npot from which the trees grow. \n[The pass nearby a voice gasping in pain] \nMARTIN \nI didn't think there were that many bones in a human body. \nARCHIVIST \n(Humourless laugh) Normally there aren't. \n(Martin exhales) \nIt takes a skilled gardener to get them to grow like this. The curling, cascading \nintricacies of collagen and marrow. \nIt takes devotion— \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 171 – The Gardener \n3 \nMARTIN \nJohn. \nARCHIVIST \nS-sorry. \nMARTIN \nYou sound like you think they're beautiful. \nARCHIVIST \nDon't you? \n(Beat) \n[Nearby sounds of flesh ripping] \nMARTIN \nIs he here? \n[Someone nearby starts whistling, getting closer; the tune is an \nEnglish Country Garden] \nARCHIVIST \nUp ahead. \nJARED HOPWORTH \nLook at this. \n(He makes tch-ing sounds of disapproval) \nIt's like you're trying to grow ugly. That won't do. You're better than that. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 171 – The Gardener \n4 \nNot to worry friend; no harm done. Just a bit of pruning will set you right. \n[He clips a bone branch; the person attached yells in muffed agony; \neventually these become sobs] \n[There is a backpack zipper jangle as Martin reacts] \nJARED (CONT'D) \nShh shh shh… No real fuss. This’ll sort you right out. Soon you'll be good as \nnew. Better, even. You just need to, reach down inside and, really feel that \nfear. Let it guide how you grow. You'll feel it in your— Hah! —bones. (sniggers) \n(Jared starts whistling an English Country Garden again) \n[He picks up a wheelbarrow, which it rattles as he heads near \nMartin and the Archivist; his footsteps shake the ground] \nARCHIVIST \nJared Hopworth. \n(Jared stops whistling) \n[Jared stops walking] \nJARED \nSure. \n[Jared sets the wheelbarrow down and takes a step forward; any \ntime he gestures there is always the sound of bone clicking and \nflesh moving] \nJARED (CON’T) \nWhy not? If you're still clinging so hard to names. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 171 – The Gardener \n5 \nARCHIVIST \nYou know why I'm here? \nJARED \nI can guess. Took a bit to figure out which rib was aching, but when I did, well. \nObvious, really. Why shouldn't you want it back? \nARCHIVIST \n(Huffs) It's too late for that now. \nJARED \nNot really. But, whatever. \n(Scornfully) Oh, and who's this? Your boyfriend? \nMARTIN \nUm— \nARCHIVIST \n(Smug) Yes, actually. \nJARED \nOh. Hm. \nSo is there any way this doesn't end in me dead? I'm guessing that's on the \ndocket if you're here. Unless you're just here to smell the flowers. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 171 – The Gardener \n6 \nARCHIVIST \nNo. I can't let you carry on like this. What happened, Jared? I thought you only \nworked on the willing. \nJARED \nWhat? (small laugh) Says who? \nOhhh, the gym! Ha! I mean, yeah, they wanted to change, but they were still \nscared. First at what I'd do to ‘em, then at what would happen if the world \ncouldn't handle their beautiful new bodies. Not like I was doing it out of the \ngoodness of my heart. (snort laugh) Hearts. Anyway. Willing. Unwilling. Don't \nwork like that anymore, does it? You made sure of that. \nMARTIN \nThat's, not fair. \nJARED \nAnd what? \nMARTIN \nI, I-Mm, uh… \nJARED \n‘sides. Don't really matter now, does it? \nARCHIVIST \nNo. No, it doesn't. \n(Jared growls)", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 0, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 4311}}
