The air \nburns, perhaps a new feeling, or perhaps one long forgotten, and you open \nyour eyes. \n[Splashing and gasping calms] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nThere is… nothing. \nYou look around you, neck twisting violently, trying to take it all in, but the \nocean that stretches away is smooth against the reddened sky, unchanging. \n[Faint sobbing gasps and some splashes] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nThere is nothing else. No boat to save you, no land to make your escape, not \neven another lost soul who shares your torments. Deep down, in the icy \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 195 – Adrift \n \n7 \ndepths, you could imagine… you could hope. The darkness hides terrible \nthings, but it could also hide salvation. You cannot know what is down there, \nbut up here it is laid out in such terrible stark detail that there is nothing. You \nonly know you are crying because the water on your face is warm enough that \nit feels like fire upon your cheek. \n[An unpleasant shifting tone also heard in the Panopticon slowly \nfades in] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nAnd beyond that, up in the sky you feel it. Looking down on you in something \napproaching delight, drinking in your despair and bitter dread. Enjoying your \nmisery and terror as you cast about for something that might be hope. It \ndisgusts you, the waves of smug satisfaction that pervade your being as it \nstares at you. You cannot bear for it to see you like this. It makes you want to \nscream, but you know your screams are exactly what it wants. \n[Splash to dive below the surface; shifting tone is gone] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nYou choke it down, and slip once again below the surface. Into the concealing \ndarkness of the freezing waters below, and you leave behind the nothing that \nwaits above. \n[Hissing static starts] \n[Transitions to sounds of a boat drifting in still water] \n[Hissing static ends] \n(The Archivist exhales) \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 195 – Adrift \n \n8 \n[The Archivist redeploys the oars and resumes his journey] \nARCHIVIST \nWell, not quite nothing. Not for me. \n[Tape clicks off] \n[Tape clicks on] \n[Rowing continues across the still water] \n(Heavy breaths as the Archivist exerts himself) \nARCHIVIST \n(Softly) There you are. \nBASIRA \n(Faintly) John? \nARCHIVIST \n(Calling) Need a ride? \nBASIRA \nI, uh... Sure. \n[Footsteps on pebbles as Basira approaches; the boat pulls up to a \nshingle shore; some plastic bangs as Basira boards and they \nshove off, the Archivist rowing] \nBASIRA (CONT’D) \nHow did you find me? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 195 – Adrift \n \n9 \nOh, right. Obviously. \nThanks. \nARCHIVIST \nOh, uh, you’re welcome. \nBASIRA \nWhat? \nARCHIVIST \nNo-Nothing. I-I just… I was worried you might be upset if I interrupted your \nwhole ‘solo reflection’ thing. \nBASIRA \nIt’s fine. I mean, I would have at first but... honestly? There are a bunch more \nhells between me and London than I thought. \n[The Archivist briefly chuckles) \nI’ve been hoping for a friendly face for a while now. \nARCHIVIST \nGlad I could oblige. \n[Rowing continues] \nBASIRA \nNot that I couldn’t make it on my own. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 195 – Adrift \n \n10 \nARCHIVIST \nOf course. \n(Beat) \nBASIRA \nYou’re not… You’re not here to just give me a lift are you? \nARCHIVIST \nI need your help. \n[Rowing stops] \nBASIRA \nYou need my help? I thought you were basically a god now? \nARCHIVIST \nAnnabelle Cane has Martin. \nBASIRA \nShit. \nARCHIVIST \nYeah. \nBASIRA \nWhen? How? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 195 – Adrift \n \n11 \nARCHIVIST \nI think she’s taking him to Hill Top Road, and... I don’t know, I just— I needed \nsomeone I could trust, and I couldn’t ask Georgie or Melanie to come all this \nway, so— \nBASIRA \nThey’re alive? \nARCHIVIST \nOh, uh, y-yes, I, um… \nBASIRA \nOh, it’s, it’s fine, you can catch me up later. Let’s focus on the Martin situation. \nARCHIVIST \nRight. \nBASIRA \nCan you, y’know, ‘see’ him? \nARCHIVIST \nNo. A-Annabelle has a— Sh-She can block The Eye. There’s a, a camera. It’s an \nartefact that was protecting Salesa’s— Right. So, um, shortly after we left you \nwe found a— \nBASIRA \nMagic camera that keeps them hidden.
