I was careful to be firm, \nbut not aggressive in my knocking as I had an odd conviction that an overly \nconfrontational knock would have made it much harder to retrieve the book. I \nneedn’t have given it any thought at all. The door opened before I’d even \nfinished knocking and I had the oddest feeling in my stomach, as though I was \nstanding on the edge of a great drop, and I took an instinctive step back. Mike \nstood there, looking terrible. \nFrom inside came the odour of a man who has not left the room or opened a \nwindow for some days. Strewn across the floor were pages and pages of \nscrawled Latin text, which alarmed me until I saw the unharmed and whole \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG046 – Literary Heights \n9 \n \nbook clutched in his arms. I started to explain what had happened and why I \nwas there, but he didn’t seem to be registering my words, just staring blankly \nat the space I occupied, as though he didn’t notice I was standing there. I \nremember I’d just about reached the point of repeating the word “cheque” \nover and over in the hopes he acknowledged it, when the first droplets of rain \nbegan to hit his window. \nWithout warning, Mike’s eyes went wide in what might have been realisation \nor maybe just fear and his face got so pale his branching scar seemed almost to \nvanish. Then the first peal of thunder rolled over us and that smell hit me with \nsuch an intensity I could barely breathe. I was on the floor before I knew what \nwas happening and turned to see Mike running full pelt down the corridor, \nclutching the Leitner book. I must have hit my head and my thinking was very \nmuddled, but I was convinced he was trying to escape with the book. With a \ndetermination that, quite frankly, I never would have expected from myself, I \ndecided that I had to stop it. I had to stop Michael Crew from stealing my \nLeitner. \nSo I got up, umbrella forgotten, and chased him out into the pouring rain. We \nweaved our way through Chichester, lightning arcing through the sky in a way \nI’d only seen a handful of times in the 40 years I lived there. I could just about \nmake out the fleeing figure of Mike in front of me and sometimes, when the \nlightning lit the sky, I could have sworn I saw someone else chasing him. It was \nhard to make out as it only seemed to appear for those momentary flashes, \nbut it seemed tall, thin, its limbs angular and branching, like Mike’s scar. \nI don’t know how he got into the bell tower for Chichester cathedral. It stands \nseparate from the main building, tall, imposing and square, starkly illuminated \nby the flashing sky. One of the doors at the base stood open and I didn’t stop \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG046 – Literary Heights \n10 \n \nto think how it had been opened before dashing inside and starting up the \nstairs. The smell was so thick inside I gagged on the acrid stench. In my \ndetermination to chase a young man stealing a book, I had apparently \ncompletely forgotten my age, which returned all at once and I collapsed \nslightly on the stairs. I began to climb then, slowly, towards the top of the bell \ntower. I have never been afraid of heights, but as I got higher and higher up \nthose stairs, my head started to swim and my heart was beating so fast I was \nhonestly worried that I was in danger of a heart attack. \nFinally, I reached the top flight of stairs. I could hear shouting from the bell \nroom. It was Mike, he was screaming something that sounded like a chant or a \nprayer. Most of it was in languages I didn’t know, but I could make out the \nwords “Altiora’’, ‘‘vertigo’’ and ‘‘the vast’’. I reached the top and there I saw \nMike standing before an open window. He held the book before him like a \nprotective ward and in front of him was a strange, branching figure. It crackled \nand fizzed, lit by a strobing white light, as though the lightning was within the \nroom itself. It was just standing there like it couldn’t approach, as Mike \nreached the crescendo of his invocation and with a cry of “I am yours” he leapt \nthrough the open window and presumably to his death. \nThe strange figure cried out, a sound like tearing sandpaper, and seemed to be \ndragged through the window with him. The sharp smell vanished instantly and \nI was alone in the dark. I say presumably about his jumping almost 100 feet to \nhis death, because when I went out I could find no body at the base of the \ntower and neither could the police who obviously treated me like a lunatic. \nWhen the sky cl", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 5, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 4500}}
