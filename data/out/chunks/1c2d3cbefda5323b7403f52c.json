Episode one hundred and one. \nAnother Twist. \n[Tape clicks on. The voices echo slightly. There’s a strange background hum.] \nORSINOV \n(Sing song) Oh, it does work! What have you been recording? Anything \nspooky? \n(The Archivist is gagged. He makes a muffled noise in response.) \nORSINOV \nIs it… your Elias who listens? Hello! \n(Another gagged response from the Archivist.) \nORSINOV \nHe’s mine now, and you can’t have him back. \n\n(The Archivist makes a gagged sound that sounds like a question.) \nORSINOV \nOh, don’t worry, it’s not for you. You won’t even need a coffin – we’re going to \nuse every piece of you. \n(The Archivist makes a noise of exclamation.) \nORSINOV \nNow could you two please move that thing somewhere far, far away? \nBREEKON \nNot really. \nHOPE \nNeeds to be near us. \nORSINOV \nWell, just… just move yourselves away, and take it with you. \nBREEKON \nGotcha \nHOPE \nRight you are. \n[They pick up the coffin and leave. The background hum is replaced by the \nsound of rain.] \n\nORSINOV \nRight. Where were we? \n(The Archivist makes a noise of indignation.) \nORSINOV \nOh, of course! So, Elias, can I call you Elias? Let me set the scene, as I know you \ncan’t actually see this. He’s tied to a chair – Sarah wanted to use nails, but I \ntalked her out of it because I’m a good friend. You’re welcome. And he is \nabsolutely surrounded with waxworks. Not… good waxworks, though. Weird \nones. Wax faces where you feel like you almost recognise who it’s meant to be, \nbut, then instead... ah, it’s downright uncanny! \n(The Archivist makes more noises of indignation.) \nORSINOV \nExcuse me! I’m talking to your boss, and I would thank you not to interrupt. \n(The Archivist continues to make muffled protests) \nYou know, I must say Elias, can I call you Elias? You have not raised this one \nvery well. \n(More muffled noises from The Archivist.) \nORSINOV \nHe is rude. And he just will not stop asking questions. Ooh, but now, I can ask \nthe questions! How are you feeling? \n(More muffled noises from The Archivist.) \n\nORSINOV \nOh wonderful. Now, about the whole skin thing… You see, originally, I was just \nplanning to have you followed, in case you found that ancient relic one. I \nmean, my goodness, it is very powerful. And if you didn’t come through, well, \nyou’re quite powerful yourself, and more than that, you are… symbolically \nappropriate (chuckles) so I thought you'd make a lovely frock! \n(The Archivist’s muffled noises sounds more panicked.) \nORSINOV \nExactly! And, well, I was going to wait, but… y’know, have you ever had one of \nthose backup plans that, when you think about it, they’re, they’re just more \nfun? So I thought, out with the old, in with… well, in with the you! \n(More panicked noises from the Archivist.) \nORSINOV \nOh, no, I’m afraid he can’t See you, can you Elias, can I call you Elias? What’s \nthe point of having a secret place of power if you can’t hide it from a big, \nstupid eye? Anyway, you sit tight. Lots to do! Ooh, also, do you have preferred \nbrand of lotion? Because you have not been taking care of your skin, and we \nreally do need it in better shape before we peel you. \n(The Archivist makes an indignant noise through the gag.) \nORSINOV \nAlright, I’ll just ask them to pick up a selection. \n[Footsteps. A door closes] \n\n(The Archivist takes several deep breaths.) \n[Tape clicks off. Tape clicks on. It’s still raining.] \n(The Archivist’s breathing is still audible.) \n[There is a strange laughter. A different door opens.] \nMICHAEL \nOh… Oh…. Oh, Archivist. What have you done now? It’s almost sad to see you \nlike this. \n(The Archivist groans.) \nMICHAEL \nAlmost. I’ve come to a decision, Archivist. I’m going to kill you. \n(The Archivist makes a noise of frustration.) \nMICHAEL \nIt’s earlier than I had hoped, but that’s life… I suppose. Your life. [Giggles] \nBefore I do, however, I want you to understand… even if it does go against my \nnature. So. \n(The Archivist gasps as the gag is taken off.) \nMICHAEL \n(Slowly, deliberately.) Ask your questions. \nARCHIVIST \nWhat?", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 0, "chunk_count": 5, "chars": 4200}}
