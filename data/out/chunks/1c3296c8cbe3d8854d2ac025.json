When he gestured for the book, I saw that his fingers \nlooked… sharp, as though the skin at the ends were being pushed into a tight \npoint by something inside. I told him that the library was closed, because at \nthat moment I could think of nothing else to say. He ignored me, and \ndemanded again that I give him the book. That was when I did something a \nlittle rash, which is to say I punched him. \nI had never really thrown a punch in anger before, or even desperation, so it \ncame as quite a shock to me when I managed to drive a single, solid fist into his \nsolar plexus. But as I did this, and this is the part that still gives me nightmares, \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG017 – The Boneturner’s Tale \n13 \n \nI felt his flesh give way and almost retract, drawing me in close. And then I felt \nhis ribs shift, shut tight around my hand, as though his ribcage were trying to \nbite me. They were sharper then I would have thought possible, and at last, \nthis was what actually started me screaming. Never before or since have I ever \nscreamed like that, and I'm still a bit surprised I'm capable of making such a \nnoise, but there you have it. \nIn my panic I dropped the copy of The Boneturner's Tale and, in less than a \nsecond, Jared was on it. He released my hand and grabbed it with a frantic \ndesperation, before he turned to run back out the way he came in. I started to \nchase after him, until I saw how he was moving. How many limbs he had. He \nhad… added some extras. That was the moment it finally all got too much for \nme; I stopped running. It wasn't my book, it wasn't my responsibility and I had \nno idea what I was dealing with, so I didn't. I just stood there in a daze and \nwatched the thing that was once Jared disappear out into the rain. I never saw \nhim again. \nThe police turned up soon after. Someone had apparently heard my screams \nand called in a report. I spun some tale about falling asleep at my desk and \nbeing woken up by an attempted robbery. God knows how I explained the \nbloody books, because it wasn't some disappearing phantom. It took weeks to \nget out. Everyone seemed to believe me, though, and miraculously I kept my \njob. I haven't seen Jared in the years since, and I haven't done any further \nresearch on the book. The best scenario I can possibly imagine is that this \nstatement is the last I ever need to hear or speak about Jared Hopworth or The \nBoneturner's Tale. \nJONATHAN SIMS \nStatement ends. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG017 – The Boneturner’s Tale \n14 \n \nWell, this makes me… deeply unhappy. I've barely scratched the surface of the \narchives and have already uncovered evidence of two separate surviving books \nfrom Jurgen Leitner's library. Until he mentioned that, I was tempted to \ndismiss much of it out of hand, but as it stands now I believe every word. I've \nseen what Leitner's work can do, and this news, even 17 years out of date, is \nstill very concerning to me. I'm going to have a discussion with Elias as to what \nwe can do to address the issue. I know he'll just give me the old “record and \nstudy, not interfere or contain” speech again, but I at least need to make him \naware of it. \nTim and Sasha have cross-referenced the events here with police reports, and \nsure enough there was a warrant issued for the arrest of Jared Hopworth for \nbreaking and entering, as well as assault. He was never found, though, and the \ncrimes weren't serious enough to keep the case active for very long. I've been \ndoing as much research myself as possible, but the book seems to have \nvanished along with him. \nI asked Martin to try and hunt down Mr. Adekoya himself for a follow-up, but \nhave been informed that he passed away in 2006. He was found lying dead in \nthe middle of the road on the night of April 17th. Despite the fact that there \nwere no crushing or trauma marks on the body, the inquest ruled it a hit and \nrun car accident due to the mangled position in which he was found. It was a \nclosed casket funeral. \nRecording Ends. \n[The Magnus Archives Theme - Outro] \n \nThe Magnus Archives is a podcast distributed by Rusty Quill and licensed under \na creative commons attribution, non-commercial share alike 4.0 international", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 7, "chunk_count": 9, "chars": 4241}}
