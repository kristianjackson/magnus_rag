It \nfelt like if you picked a line, any line, you could follow it through to the centre \nto some deep truth, if only your eye could keep track of the strand that had \ncaught it. The centre of the table looked at first like it was simply part of the \nwooden top, but if you looked closely, as I did so often, you could see an \noutline marking the very middle as a small, square box, carved with patterns \njust like the ones that laced their way over the rest of the table. I don’t \nremember how long we sat around the table those evenings, nor do I have any \nmemory of what we might have eaten. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 059 – Recluse \n8 \n \nSo, I passed a couple of years in relative peace. I actually studied, stayed \nmostly out of trouble and, as my 18th birthday approached, it looked like I \nmight be able to find someone to teach me a decent trade. At that point, I was \nthe oldest there by a few months, the others having left the house as they \neach turned 18 in turn. A suited man would come around, though rarely the \nsame one twice. Ray would sign some papers and my former house sibling \nwould head out the door and into the wide world. I didn’t see them after that, \nbut at the time I didn’t really think anything of it. I assumed they were too busy \ntrying to survive in a world that I had always considered deeply hostile. \nAgnes came to the house two months before my birthday, in the middle of \nwinter. Ray had never mentioned her, never held one of his little meetings to \nintroduce her; she was just suddenly in the house one day and no one really \nthought to question it. She was younger than the other kids, maybe 10 or 11 \nyears old, and didn’t talk much. She had a small, sharp face and long brown \nhair always braided into two tight pigtails, which she would twirl around her \nfingers whenever you tried to talk to her. I’ll admit she was a bit spooky, \nlooking back on it, but to be honest, at the time, I never really questioned it, \nthe same way I never really questioned any of it. She never came to church \nthough, never sat around the dinner table when it was uncovered. Whenever \nRay came in the room and she was in there, he would often just turn around \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 059 – Recluse \n9 \n \nand leave, and once I could have sworn that he looked at her with something \nin his eyes that, even in my dulled state, I recognised as fear. \nI was so focused on my upcoming emancipation that I didn’t pay much \nattention to these developments, and I can’t tell you much more about Agnes \nor what she did with her time in the house. All I know is that when the man \nfrom the Children’s Committee came with the papers for Ray to sign, she was \nstanding at the bottom of the stairs, watching me with an expression that \nlooked almost playful. \nRay signed the documents to remand me fully back to state custody. The age \nof majority back then was 21, but from 18 I was expected to be finding work \nand accommodation on my own. It was all a bit surreal, watching pens sign my \nlife into its different stages without holding any of them myself. As the man in \nthe suit told me to follow him in a clipped BBC accent, Agnes walked over and \ngestured for me to lean down and listen to her. I did so, but instead of a \nconspiratorial whisper, she just gave me a quick kiss on the cheek, then ran off \ndown the hall. I stood there for a moment, confused, before my temporary \nguardian once again instructed me to follow him. \nI did so, and the cold air of the outside hit me like a slap across the face. We \nwalked for a few minutes to the end of the road and I felt as though my", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 3, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 3717}}
