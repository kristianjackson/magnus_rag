Then \nthe scraping came again, now from the other direction, and I sank to the floor, \nclutching my camera to my chest like some sort of protective talisman. It was \nsilent, once again. \nThe noise that broke the stillness this time is the one that is still ringing in my \nears. It was far more dreadful than the others because of how familiar it was, \nthough I had never heard it in such a manner before. It was Luke’s voice and it \nwas screaming in agony. A shrill, gut-wrenching screech of pain and fear that \nwiped away all thought in a second and replaced it with blind panic. I wanted \nto run, but my legs had locked up. Somewhere in my mind, I remembered the \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 063 – The End of the Tunnel \n \n10 \n \nflash on my camera, and my fingers instinctively flicked the switch. As I pressed \nthe button, the screaming stopped with a wet snap and, for the worst moment \nof my life, an explosion of light shot through the darkness. \nI saw Luke hanging in the air. There was nobody around him, but on the wall, in \nstark black outlines, I saw two long, thin shadows standing beside him. On \neach, I saw one spindly arm gripping his shadow by the shoulders, while the \nother held up the shadow of his torn off head. In front of me, the real one just \nhung there, dangling as if by some invisible thread, blood dripping onto the \nbody below it. His eyes were staring at me, as though pleading for my feeble \nflashing camera to save him. I screamed. \nThe next thing I remember was the painfully bright light of a dozen torches on \nmy face. It was the rector of St Paul’s and a small group of what I assumed to \nbe parishioners. He didn’t say a word as he gently led me back towards the \nentrance. I looked around to see if Luke’s body was there, but I knew deep \ndown that the darkness had eaten him and he was gone. \nThe rector was very understanding, though I wasn’t making much sense. He \nspoke soft words of reassurance, brought me out into the sick, pale blue of \ndawn and called an ambulance to look me over. I didn’t get his name and it \nwas only after I’d reached the hospital, I realised he had taken my camera. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 063 – The End of the Tunnel \n \n11 \n \nSince then, I’ve been under observation in the hospital. Nobody listens to my \nstory and Luke has been officially listed as missing. Steph has been very \nsupportive, but I can see the pain in her eyes. She knows I was the last one to \nsee her brother and it eats at her. I don’t really know what to do now, except \nto keep the lights on. \nARCHIVIST \nStatement ends. \nIt should come as no surprise to me by now that the foundation stone of the \noriginal church of St James’ in West Hackney was laid on the 17th November \n1821 by Sir Robert Smirke. Even so, I was very much hoping to find at least one \narchitectural oddity lurking beneath the streets of London that did not bear \nthe mark of him or his students. This particular encounter doesn’t seem to \nhave much in common with manifestations from similar buildings. We’ve had \nsomething of a spectrum from him and his ilk. Cobwebs, entombing, difficulty \nin navigation, and now a violent, murderous dark. \nMy first thought was the People’s Church of the Divine Host, as they seem to \nhave some affinity to the darkness, but I can find no connection of any sort \nbetween them and West Hackney church. Not that any of the staff there were \nvery helpful. Every one of them claims to have no memory of encountering Ms", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 4, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 3510}}
