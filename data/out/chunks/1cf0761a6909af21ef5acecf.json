Alex here, director of The Magnus Archives and voice of Martin \non the show. \nI’m just taking a moment ahead of today’s episode for a couple of updates. \nFirstly, in order to ensure we thank every Patron who has been promised a \nshoutout, we are moving them to the end of episodes going forwards. This is \nbecause we need to increase the number of names read, and we don’t wish to \nincrease the delay at the start of episodes any further. \nSecondly, I need to give everyone a warning: Season 5 of The Magnus Archives \nwas conceived, written, and entered production well before the current \nsituation regarding COVID-19, and it dives pretty heavily into themes of \nisolation, contagion, and Armageddon. \nAfter serious consideration, we have elected to release this season as it was \noriginally intended, as we felt doing otherwise would be a disservice to the \nstory and all our dedicated listeners. \nWe will, of course, continue to provide content warnings in the show notes for \nevery episode, and we advise everyone to check these, even if customarily you \ndon’t. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 161 – Dwelling \n2 \nThirdly and finally, we just wanted to thank everyone for their support and \npatience during this season break. We couldn’t have done this without you. \nAnd now, the wait is over, and we hope you enjoy the final season of The \nMagnus Archives. \n[The Magnus Archives Theme – Intro] \nJONATHAN SIMS \nRusty Quill presents: The Magnus Archives. Episode one hundred and sixty-\none: \"Dwelling.\" \n[Theme finishes] \n[Tape clicks on] \n[Sounds of breathing and cloths movement in the otherwise quiet \nspace] \nMARTIN \nCareful! \nTIM \nSh-hh! \n[A squeak as the Archivist’s office door opens] \n[A light switch is flicked on] \nTIM, SASHA, MARTIN \nSURPRISE! \n[Someone blows a party horn] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 161 – Dwelling \n3 \n[The Archivist drops a stack of paper] \nARCHIVIST \nJesus! \nTIM \nHappy birthday, boss. \nSASHA \nHappy- Oh, (laughing) are you okay? \nARCHIVIST \nNo, I!- Christ, one second. \n[The Archivist begins collecting up the dropped papers] \nMARTIN \nSorry, sorry; Tim wanted to surprise you, and- \nTIM \nSnitch. \nARCHIVIST \nNo, no, it’s fine, thank you. Just a- shock. \nTIM \nWell, that’s the idea! \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 161 – Dwelling \n4 \nARCHIVIST \nIndeed. Though, uh, honestly, the bottle of wine was just fine. \n[He pulls out a chair as he talks] \nTIM \nPfft, yeah, as a decoy. \nARCHIVIST \nYes, well, thank you. This is very- (final page rustle) elaborate of you. \nSASHA \nPlus, it was kind of fun, giving you a heart attack. \n(Slight laugh from Tim) \nARCHIVIST \nMm, I’m sure. I notice you didn’t jump out at Martin when he had a birthday. \nTIM \n(Smiling) No, he’s way too jumpy as it is. \n(Martin lets out a short sound of offense) \nTIM (CONT’D) \nWe were worried he might damage himself! \nMARTIN \nHey! Well- I preferred going out for ice cream anyway. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 161 – Dwelling \n5 \nARCHIVIST \nYou went for ice cream? \nSASHA \nYes, you were there! \nMARTIN \nYou had- rum and raisin, and taught us all about emulsifiers. \nARCHIVIST \nOh. Right, yes, (unconvincing) I- I remember. \nTIM \n(Smiling) Liar. \nARCHIVIST \nWell, thank you anyway. This is all- very touching. \nTIM \nWe just wanted to do something to lighten the mood, you know? \nARCHIVIST \nYes, I’m- (inhales) aware it’s been a- rough start. \nSASHA \nThat’s not what this was about; we just thought you could use a chance to \nunwind. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 161 – Dwelling \n6 \nARCHIVIST \nI.. suppose it couldn’t hurt. \n[Two quick knocks on the door] \nJONAH MAGNUS (AS ELIAS) \nKnock knock. \nTIM \nDouble boss! \nSASHA \n(Guarded) Elias? \nJONAH \nI’m not too late for cake, am I? \nARCHIVIST \nThere’s a cake? \nTIM \nHow did y- Martin! That was a secret! \nMARTIN \nI didn’t say anything! \nJONAH \nHe didn’t have to. Nothing escapes my notice, and I like to keep an eye out for \nthis sort of thing. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 161 – Dwelling \n7 \nTIM \nWell- it’s- good to see you. \nARCHIVIST \nYes- Y,yes! \n[Chair movement] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nCome in! \nJONAH \nSo, how old is the birthday boy? \nARCHIVIST \nUh- thirty-eight. \nSASHA \n(Tch-ing) Liar. \n(Slight laugh from Tim) \nARCHIVIST \n(Petulant) How would you know. \nTIM \nWhat, does someone need to change their password again? \nARCHIVIST \nI- what?", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 0, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 4436}}
