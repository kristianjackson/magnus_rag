So in we went. \nKnocking through the rest of the wall didn’t take long. It had been built to look \nlike the rest of the basement, but hadn’t been constructed with the same skill. \nTen minutes later our coffees lay forgotten on the floor and we stood before a \npassageway leading off into the musty darkness. A gentle breeze blew from \nthis entrance, which didn’t make any sense at all. We had plenty of torches, as \nyou often need them during night work, so we each took one large one and a \nsmaller back-up in case the first had any problems. We tried to tell Gerard to \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG035 – Old Passages \n7 \n \nstay outside, but I could see immediately that, short of tying him up, there was \nno way we were going to keep him out of there. Tying him up did feel like a \nstep too far, so we settled for keeping a close eye on him as we went inside. \nThe passageway was cold, and the air thick with mildew, but the stone walls \nwere in very good condition. Rachel said it looked to be from the mid-19th \ncentury, probably remains of the basement of the Carlton Club, which used to \nbe located in what was now 100 Pall Mall. It was with a start I realised that she \nwas right, based on where the corridor was going, we must have been \nunderneath the building. Almost exactly where Jurgen Leitner had wanted us \nto dig almost fifteen years ago. \nWe walked for some time, longer than I would have expected, given how big I \nremembered the building above us being. Alf kept asking Rachel if the corridor \nwas getting narrower, and every time, she would dutifully measure the width \nand inform him that, no, it was exactly five feet wide. I couldn’t blame him, \nreally, I’ve never had any sort of claustrophobia, but I was finding it hard, at \npoints to catch my breath, to dismiss the feeling that the walls were pressing \non me. Gerard walked on ahead, seemingly unbothered by the place. \nWe came to crossroads. Or, more precisely, a star. The chamber was small, \nround and featureless, but there were doorways leading out in a circle. I \ncounted thirteen, not including the one we had come in from. Looking down \nsome of them made me feel oddly queasy. There was one that, for all the \nworld, it felt like I was going to fall into it. Another was so dark that our torches \ndidn’t seem to reach more than a few feet inside. In the centre, there was a \ndatestone. It read: “Robert Smirke, 1835. Balance and fear”. \nI don’t know how much you know about famous London architects, but Robert \nSmirke was one of the foremost proponents of the Gothic Revival in the early", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 4, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 2701}}
