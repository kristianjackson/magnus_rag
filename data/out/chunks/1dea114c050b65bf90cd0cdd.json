So are baths. \n \nTREVOR \nYou see what I’ve got to put up with, Mr Sims? \n \nARCHIVIST \nI, um... Yeah, it’s... What do you do for money? \n \nJULIA \nSorry? \n \nARCHIVIST \nI-I-I j-just … I doubt roaming around killing things pays all that well. What, what \ndo you do to support yourself? \n \nJULIA \nOh, I don’t know, we find ways. When you’re out here, the odd bit of robbery \nor trespass doesn’t really phase you. \n \nARCHIVIST \nAnd why America? \n \nTREVOR \nHeard tell there were a wolfman. Old Davies down in Plymouth swore blind his \nbrother had seen one up the Pacific Crest Trail. \n \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG109 – Nightfall \n \n20 \n \nJULIA \nI told Trevor he was a liar, but here we are anyway. Have been for a couple of \nyears. \n \nTREVOR \nHey now, no wolfman, sure, but there’s been plenty out here what needs \nkilling. \n \nJULIA \nTrue enough. Plus, it’s hard to leave – we’re not exactly here legally and trying \nto get a flight home would get us noticed by authorities we’d rather avoid. \n \nTREVOR \nI keep telling her we could hop a boat. \n \nJULIA \nAnd I tell him I’d rather stay hunting here than trap myself on a boat for two \nweeks. \n \nARCHIVIST \nSo, what have you— \n \n(Deep breath) \n \nMAX \n(Rasping) Shut up! \n \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG109 – Nightfall \n \n21 \n \nTREVOR \nHey, look who’s talking! \n \nMAX \n(Struggling to talk) You could have at least chopped my ears off too. You \npeople just won’t shut up. How am I supposed to get the lungs lined up right \nwhen I can’t even concentrate? \n \nJULIA \nHappy to chop them off again if you need the practice. \n \nMAX \nDo it. You’re the ones who want to talk. \n \nARCHIVIST \nWhy were you looking for me? \n \nMAX \nWhy do you think? Out here, exposed, unaware, on your own, at least I \nthought so – thought it was a good chance to get you home, to get you ready \nfor the dance. \n \nJULIA \nIs this that “unknowing dance”? \n \nARCHIVIST \nYeah. Ok, Mustermann, or whatever your name— \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG109 – Nightfall \n \n22 \n \n \nMAX \nJust turn it off. You got more questions, you turn that thing off. \n \nARCHIVIST \nI don’t think you’re in any position to make demands. \n \nMAX \nMaybe not, but are you sure you know what’s listening in? \n \nARCHIVIST \nDo you? \n \nMAX \nNo, but I don’t like it. \n \nTREVOR \nWhat’s he mean, “listening in”? \n \nARCHIVIST \nWh— No, I, I’m not... \n \nJULIA \nI knew this was a bad idea. Turn it off. \n \nARCHIVIST \nIt, it’s fine, it’s never bee— \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG109 – Nightfall \n \n23 \n \n \nJULIA \n(Articulating slowly) Turn it off. \n \n(Click) \n[The Magnus Archives Theme - Outro] \n \nThe Magnus Archives is a podcast distributed by Rusty Quill and licensed under \na Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Sharealike 4.0 International \nlicence. \n \nToday’s episode was written by Jonathan Sims and directed by Alexander J \nNewall. \n \nIt featured: Jonathan Sims as the Archivist, Francesca Renée Reid as Julia \nMontauk, Ian Hayles as Trevor Herbert and Brock Winstead as Max \nMustermann.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 7, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 3082}}
