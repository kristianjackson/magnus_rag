I just sat there, unable to look away. Finally, it reached our \nhouse, and all at once the lights were gone and the darkness was inside. I \nheard a knock on the front door. Firm, unhurried and insistent. Silence. I did \nnot move. The knocking came again, harder this time, and I heard the door \nrattle on its hinges. As it got louder it began to sound less and less like a person \nknocking and more like… wet meat being slammed the study wood of the front \ndoor. \nI turned and ran towards the phone. Picking it up, I heard a dial tone, and \nwould have cried with relief if I wasn’t already crying with fear. I dialled the \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG009 – A Father’s Love \n12 \n \npolice, and as soon as they picked up I started to babble about what was \nhappening. The lady on the other end was patient with me, and kept on gently \ninsisting I give her the address until finally I was composed enough. Almost as \nsoon as I had told her where I was I heard the door begin to splinter. I dropped \nthe phone and ran towards the back of the house. As I did so, I heard the front \ndoor burst behind me and I heard a… growl – it was rumbling, deep and \nbreathy like a wild animal but had a strange tone to it that I’ve never been able \nto place. No matter where I turned, it sounded like it came out of the darkness \nright behind me. I didn’t have time think about it as I ran into the back garden \nand into a light that I did not expect. There in front of me was the shed. It \nglowed, a dull, pulsing blue from every crack and seam. I didn’t stop, though, \nas I heard again that growl behind me and I ran towards it and pulled at the \ndoor. \nThe shed was not locked that night, and to this day I don’t know if I regret that \nfact. The first thing I saw when I opened that door was my father, bathed in \nthe pale blue light. I couldn’t see any source for the glow but it was so bright. \nHe was knelt in the centre of an ornate chalk pattern scrawled on the rough \nwood of the floor. In front of him lay a man I didn’t know, but he was clearly \ndead – his chest had been cut open and still gaped and bled feebly. In one \nhand my father held a wicked-looking knife, and in the other he held the man’s \nheart. My father was chanting and as the song rose and fell the heart in his \nhand beat to its rhythm, and the blue light brightened and dimmed in time. I \nlooked at the walls, and noticed that they were covered in shelves, each of \nwhich contained glass jars, full of what I would later learn was formaldehyde \ncontaining a single heart, which also beat in time with the one that dripped in \nmy father’s hand. It was an odd thing to notice at the time but I remember that", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 7, "chunk_count": 10, "chars": 2742}}
