And dismiss as you will \nmy words as the shaken memory of a man appalled, but at that awful moment, \ntheir cries of worship seemed to form shapes that stirred in the water such as I \nhave never seen in my time upon this earth. \nI fled, of course, and considered the courses such as I might pursue to relieve \nmyself of this dreadful burden of knowledge. No longer was my concern purely \nfor revenge upon Raymer, but a quite acute terror of the savage rites the \npractice of which were clearly amongst my peers. I had not seen with clarity \nthose compatriots alongside whom Raymer had joined in awful raptures, and \ncould not state with confidence that any among the faculty to whom I might \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 140 – The Movement of the Heavens \n \n9 \n \nmake report of his debauchery would not in turn make it known that I was \ntelling such things of Halley, an astronomer of note whose conduct to all \nothers has been unimpeachable. No, if there was to be a confrontation or \naction taken against Raymer, it would be I and I alone that would have to take \nit. \nI know it was the second of May when this took place, for it was no doubt the \ncrowning glory that he had stolen from me that occupied his mind that eve, \nand caused his steps to quicken and grow careless. Again he traced his path \nunto that dark and hidden wood, and again I followed, quiet in my manner, \nkeen in my observance. I cast around for other figures, but in that moment \nRaymer was alone. He proceeded then as before to the pool of blackest water, \nand the clear skies of night were lost amongst the leaves. All was quiet as he \ngazed into that smoothed and liquid darkness. This I knew was to be my \nchance. \nI stepped from my place of concealment and began to decry him, casting my \ncensure upon Raymer and naming before him the vile acts of pagan villainy \nwhich I had myself observed. His mute shock was but that of a moment before \nhe let out a noise the likes of which I can scarce describe and charged towards \nme, his fingers curled to claws that sought my face and eyes. I wasted no time \nand drew my smallsword, and praise to God who gifted to me foresight to \ncarry it. I struck Raymer a fierce blow to the leg. He fell, still clutching at me, \nand in a moment cast my sword away into the trees and grabbed at my coat. \nWith a fierce strength never before awakened within me, I gripped the head of \nmy foul adversary and forced it down, into the dark pool before us. There I \nheld it, the water so cold upon my skin the marks have yet to fade, and Raymer \nthrashed and kicked and made such sounds as I have never before heard of the \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 140 – The Movement of the Heavens \n \n10 \n \ndying. And he was still. I drew him up with the black water still thickly flowing \nfrom him. He was dead at my hand, and though I well knew it to be an act of \ndefence and retribution, I felt within me a sudden terror of discovery. \nI took my sword and returned to hiding in the dense growth of the forest, \nfearing that should I return upon the path my passing may be met and marked. \nBetter to wait until I had the surety of unseen passage. And as I waited there, \nthe enormity of my action settled upon me like lead, and Raymer’s dark-eyed \ncompatriots arrived to attend him. Seeing him prostrate and lifeless upon the \nground was clearly a shock and their distress was marked upon them. And yet \nthere seemed no sadness or horror within their passion, but surprise and \nconfusion, and the question they cast between them was that of what was to \nbe done, for it seemed Raymer was vital to a task as yet left unfinished. His \nbody was borne up by them and taken away, at time I believed for burial. And \nwhen I was certain I was once again alone I fled, leaving those infernal waters \nfor good and all. \nAnd were that the end of my poor story you may well imagine my confession \nof such to you, for laying it in writing is an unburdening beyond what I could \nhave foreseen. And yet it was not this that inspired in me the need to write \nyou an account. It was what occurred but two days past, for I was in my \nobservatory making my notes and adjustments as my position requires, when I \nwas called upon, not unusually, by the President of the Royal Society. I was \nastonished at how cordial his conduct seemed, his temper even and his heat \nsteady, but it was not the attitude of the President that robbed my tongue of \nspeech. It was that in his visit he was accompanied by Edmond Halley. My dear \nR", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 2, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 4500}}
