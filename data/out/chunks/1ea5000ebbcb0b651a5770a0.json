So, I was starting to regret not getting a coffee and talking \nto tall, blond and monster, since it didn’t seem like I’d have missed much. I got \non with my work, did some filing, cross-checked a few statements with police \nincident reports. I mean, I guess I don’t need to tell you what a day working in \nthe archives entails. It was a quiet day, aside from when Martin thought he \nsaw one of those silver worms and we spent half an hour checking for it. \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nYes. I remember. \n \nSASHA \nCome on, it’s not his fault he’s being stalked by some weird living hive. \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG026 – A Distortion \n7 \n \nI know, but it would have to have been Martin, wouldn’t it? I mean, anything \ngoes wrong around here, it always seems to happen to him. Anyway, we’re \ngetting off topic. Why didn’t you report this? \n \nSASHA \nSeriously? If a member of the public came in, you would have torn that \nstatement to shreds. No, I, I figured I’d get more evidence or it wasn’t worth \nmentioning. Nothing else had happened until I left work. It must have been \nabout half past six, so the sun was just about starting to go down, and I headed \nback up towards Victoria. The first thing I noticed out of the ordinary was that \nthe café was still open. Normally they shut up about six o’clock, but the lights \nwere on and the door was open. I couldn’t see anyone behind the counter, \nthough, and there was only one customer. He sat there in the exact same \nposition he’d been that morning, drinking what could easily have been the \nexact same coffee. \nI looked around to see if there was anyone else who could confirm what I was \nseeing. The street was empty, but as I looked, a car drove past. In the curving \nglass of its tinted windows, I saw him there, the weird distorted body, rail thin \nand limp, the hands huge and sharp. And then the car passed on and I turned \nback to see a normal-looking man. But now, for the first time, he was looking \nat me. He gestured to the chair across from him, clearly inviting me inside. I \ndon’t know why I wasn’t more scared going in there, but I wasn’t. My curiosity \napparently conquered my nervousness. \nHe didn’t speak when I sat down, and I saw his coffee cup was empty. \nWhatever was inside had dried up hours ago. He seemed to be waiting for me \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG026 – A Distortion \n8 \n \nto ask him a question. So I asked him what he was. He laughed at this, the first \nsound I’d heard him make, and it sounded… unnatural. Like he was laughing \nvery quietly, but someone had turned up the volume up so I could hear it. He \nsaid it didn’t matter what he was, that he couldn’t describe it even if he \nwanted to. What was the phrase he used… “How would a melody describe \nitself when asked?” \nThis put my back up a bit to be honest, and I told him if he was going to talk in \ncheap riddles I was just going to leave. He actually apologised, told me I could \ncall him Michael. I didn’t want to call him Michael; it didn’t seem to fit \nsomehow, and the way he said it made me think that it definitely was not his \nname. Still, it wasn’t like I had any other name for him. No, not for him. For it. \nIt sat there, clearly waiting for me to ask another question, so I did. I asked it \nwhat it wanted, and was told that it wanted to help. \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nHelp? With… what? \n \nSASHA \nThat’s what I said. Did it want to stop Jane Prentiss? It laughed that weird \nlaugh again and told me that I had no idea what was really going on. It didn’t \nsound like it had any intention of telling me, though, it just seemed like it was \namused by my attempts to understand. Then it said it didn’t care if I or my \ncompanions lived or died, but that “the flesh-hive was always rash”. It said it \nwanted to be friends.
