Light spilled out of the open entrance, as the steam organ kept playing. \nI entered to see two clowns fighting. Not the slapstick routines of the clowns \nI’d been used to, rife with wordplay and satire, but a crunching violence I had \nnever seen before. One of them, huge and scowling in white and purple polka-\ndots, pinned down its smaller companion, whose bright yellow shirt was now \nstreaked with red. With each blow from the big clown, the crowd, among \nwhom I could clearly see my father, howled with laughter and cheers. The \nlaughter didn’t sound right. None of it was right. It was as though I was looking \nat a tent full of vicious strangers, every one of whom wore a face I had known \nsince birth. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG044 – Tightrope \n8 \n \nThen my gaze drifted upwards, to the tightrope stretched between the \ntowering tent poles, and my heart stopped. Halfway across, tottering on legs \ntoo short to balance properly, was Ivan. Everything else was forgotten as I \nwatched him there, and the sounds of the world around me faded away. The \nquestion of how he had got up there, or made it halfway along that thin metal \nwire, didn’t even enter my mind. I could think of nothing but that next step \nthat would send him tumbling to a floor caked in sand, greasepaint and blood. \nNo-one else in the audience or the ring seemed to have noticed him up there, \nand my throat had closed too tight to call to them. I could do nothing but \nwatch as Ivan took another step along the tightrope. He swayed to one side, \nthen the other, and I could see he was crying, tears falling to the floor like \nsingle drops of rain. He took another step. And then another. He did not fall. I \nwatched in amazement as my seven-year-old brother walked and walked. My \nheart was still clenched in fear, and I could not breathe. Ivan took his final step, \nlifted his right foot, and placed it upon the platform on the opposite tent pole. \nHe had made it. He gripped the pole and moved around it and out of sight. \nI do not know how long I had stood there watching, but it seemed like only a \nmoment later I felt my father’s hand grip me by the shoulder. I turned to see \nhim standing there with Ivan by his side. He had a look on his face as though he \nhad eaten something that had spoiled, and without a word he led us out of the \ncircus and back to our home. The field was empty by the next morning. \nNo-one in our village ever spoke of that night, and when the state circus came \nto Morshansk the next year, my father did not offer to take us, and we did not \nask. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG044 – Tightrope \n9 \n \nFor many years, I thought that it might have been some strange dream or \ndistorted memory, as no-one ever acknowledged that it had happened. But I \nasked Ivan about it when we were older, and he hesitantly said that he \nremembered the circus coming, but everything after running through the gate \nwas a blur. I pressed him further on the subject, and he just shook his head. He \ndidn’t remember what happened, he said, but he still got terrible nightmares. \nEvery November, around when the circus had come to Algasovo, he would \ndream that he was there again. He could smell the sawdust and hear the \nsteam-organ playing, but he could not move. In the dream he would find \nhimself tightly bound with coarse rope and trapped inside a thick hessian sack. \nI remembered those nights. He always woke up screaming. \nGERTRUDE \nFinal comments: sounds, from what I can tell, like Yuri Utkin and his brother \nwere rather lucky in their encounter with the circus, as both escaped with only \nsignificant mental trauma. A decidedly tame result for a run-in with Gregor \nOrsinov’s troupe, especially as this would have been during the height of their \ntour. If it was in the 70s, after Denikin had left, then maybe it would come as \nless of a surprise, but as it stands, I think it somewhat amazing that the whole \ntown appears to have made it through in one piece. Obviously, it’s a good \nthing the children survived, but it does pique my interest in Ivan Utkin. \nUnfortunately, he appears to have passed away in 1984, but he must have \nbeen something rather special. \n[Tape clicks off.
