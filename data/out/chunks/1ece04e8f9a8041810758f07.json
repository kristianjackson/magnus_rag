Victorian, I think, and though it’s been repaired and maintained \nquite well, it’s got all sorts of strange little quirks. One of these is the windows. \nThe actual windows in the flats are fine, but the stairwells they have slightly \nwarped glass, where the window have those little bubbles. Looking down on \nthe street below can be a bit strange, as the glass bends the light and distorts \nwhatever’s below it. I never really paid much attention to it until a few days \nago, but it’s not a new thing. \nIt was the day before yesterday when I first saw it. When I’m heading down the \nstairs in the morning, I sometime like to spend a few seconds looking out of \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG026 – A Distortion \n4 \n \nthe window at the people on the street below. I’ll move my head so that I see \nthem through the warped glass, and they’ll distort like a funhouse mirror. It’s a \nbit daft, but I have a pretty dreary commute down to Victoria, so I take my fun \nwhere I can get it. Well, on that morning I paused before the window, and \nnoticed one of the warped figures below was… off, slightly. It looked too tall, \nthe limbs and body were very thin and almost wavy, like they didn’t have any \nstructure or bones in them. I couldn’t make out a face, but it was the hands \nthat were the most bizarre. They seemed to be stretched and inflated by the \ndistorted light, until they were almost the size of the rest of the torso. The \nfingers were long and stiff, and seemed to end in sharp points. It stood \ncompletely motionless, and I could feel it staring at me. \nMoving my head to the side, I saw that the actual person I had been looking at \nwas a large man with long, blond hair. He was neither stood still nor facing me, \ninstead moving around the display of the flower shop opposite my building. \nNothing about the guy seemed especially out of place, but I made a mental \nnote to keep a lookout for him. I checked again through the bubble of bended \nglass and again I saw that tall figure with its limp arms and huge hands. \nNow, you know me John, I’m, I’m not exactly the bravest person in the world. I \ngenerally avoid horror and I tend to stay off rollercoasters in the rare situation \nI have a chance to ride them. So I was as surprised as anyone that this \nundeniably sinister figure wasn’t causing me more distress. I mean, I was a bit \nnervous, sure. I’ve never had any direct experience with the supernatural \nbefore and the more I looked and checked and double-checked, the more sure \nI was that supernatural was exactly what it was. To be honest, I was surprised \nhow quickly I accepted that. I’ve always considered myself a bit of a sceptic, \nand until recently I’d have said working at the Institute only made me more so.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 1, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 2771}}
