Despite all this, there was something about it that \nsat uneasily with me. \nWilfred returned to the 2nd Manchesters in July of 1918. He was clearly much \nchanged from his time away, and seemed to be in good enough spirits, though \nwe talked little any more, and when he looked at me, I saw in his eyes a fear \nthat he was quick to hide. The war was grinding towards a close at this point. \nThere was a fatigue that could be felt everywhere; even the enemy machine \nguns felt slower and more begrudging in their fire, but this charged our \ncommanders to spur us on to more and more aggressive actions. Some \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG00X – The Piper \n10 \n \ndesperate attempt to push Germany into a surrender, I suppose, and our \nattacks grew to a crescendo. \nOn the first day of October, we were ordered to storm the enemy position at \nJoncourt. I remember that the weather that day was beautiful – a last day of \nsunshine before autumn pressed in. We charged with some success, as I \nbelieve the German artillery hadn’t been lined up correctly, and for the first \ntime since his return I found myself fighting alongside Wilfred. I can say \nwithout a word of a lie that across all the war I never saw a soldier fight with \nsuch ferocity as I saw in him that day. I hasten to add that that statement is not \ngiven in admiration – the savagery I saw in him as he tore into a man with his \nbayonet… I’d just as soon forget it. As he charged, he howled a terrible battle \ncry and, just for a moment, I could have sworn that I saw him cast a shadow \nthat was not his own. I read in the paper he won the Military Cross for that \nattack. \nIt was a month later that I woke up to find him sitting next to my bed. He \nstared at me, not unkindly, though there was something in his eye that put my \nill at ease. “Almost over now, Clarence,” he said to me. I said yes, it did seem to \nbe all coming to an end. He smiled and shook his head. He sat their quietly for \nsome time, at one point a flare burst in the sky outside, and enough of that \nstark red light came through the dugout’s makeshift doorway for me to see \nthat Wilfred was crying. I knew he was listening to The Piper’s tune. He asked \nme if I heard it, and I told him no, I didn’t, and I wasn’t sure I ever really had. \nHe nodded, and said he didn’t know which of us was the lucky one, and neither \ndid I. Still don’t, really. \nWilfred Owen died crossing the canal at Sambre-Oise two days later. There \nwasn’t meant to be much, if any, resistance, but some of the soldiers stationed \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG00X – The Piper \n11 \n \nthere returned fire. I found myself crouching behind him as the Captain, who \nhad been shot in hip, was pulled to safety. As we prepared to charge, Wilfred \nstopped all at once and turned to me with a smile on his face. At that moment \nI saw a trickle of blood start to flow from an opening hole in his forehead. I feel \nlike I should make this clear – I have seen many people get shot. I know what it \nlooks like and how a bullet hole appears. But here, the bullet hole simply \nopened, like an eye, and he fell to the ground, dead. It was told to me later \nthat it was on that day the first overtures of peace were made between the \nnations, and the Armistice was signed almost exactly a week later. We were \nshipped home soon after. \nI believe it was not merely on that day, but at that very moment, when Wilfred \nfell, that the peace was finally assured. No-one can convince me otherwise. Did \nThe Piper spare him before? Did it simply use him, later to cast him aside? I \ndon’t know, and I try not to think about it overmuch. I have a wife now, and a \nchild on the way, but I still get nightmares sometimes. The parade for Armistice \nDay passed by my house last year, and I had to shut my window tight when the \nmilitary band marched past. It wasn’t a tune I cared to hear. \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nStatement ends. \nWell, if further evidence was needed of my predecessor’s disorganisation, here \nwe have it. A statement from 1922 filed among the mid-2000s. Obviously \nthere’s not much research or further investigation to be done into a case \nalmost a hundred years old, especially when it involves so well documented a \nfigure as Wilfred Owen.
