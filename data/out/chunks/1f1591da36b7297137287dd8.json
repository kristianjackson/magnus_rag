As soon as Gabriel spotted me, he hopped up and hurried \nover to me. He grabbed my hand in a firm, damp grip and started to thank me. \nI was the best assistant he could have asked for, he said, he’d improved so \nmuch because of me. \nAs he said this, the structure beneath his face shifted, pushing it further and \nfurther from where his skull should have been, and behind his teeth, at the \nedges of his eyes, I saw the dull red of shifting clay. His smile kept getting \nwider, and bending in on itself at the edges, and where his fingers touched the \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 126 – Sculptor’s Tool \n8 \n \nback of my trembling hand, I could feel his spiralling fingerprints start to turn \naround and around. The marks won’t come off, no matter how hard I scrub. \nThat was when I ran. I suppose I could have run before then, but I wouldn’t \nhave wanted to seem rude and it’s not like any of it could have been real, is it? \nIt was just me losing it a bit. It has to have been. I mean, I’ve seen Ray and Bill \naround since. Certainly, they don’t like to make eye contact and Bill cries a lot \nin church, but they’re still here. They’re fine; so it didn’t happen. There’s no \nreason for me to stay away from the community centre. There’s no reason for \nme to sit inside all evening, trying not to look too closely at any of the doors. \nI got a letter a week ago. It was from Gabriel. It said that he had found a new \njob, and he’d love it if I came up to assist him again. He’s working in a place \ncalled Sannikov Land. I looked it up. It doesn’t exist. And it sounds cold. \nI don’t think I should go. \nI’m not going to go. \nARCHIVIST \nStatement ends. \nThe Worker-in-Clay, that’s what Michael called him in his statement. A Great \nTwisting, that Gertrude stopped at the cost of a single life. \nI thought moving away from my humanity would have made that seem more \nacceptable, that sort of sacrifice, but it just makes me sad. I remembered \nGertrude’s notebook. We found it alongside the plastic explosives, but it rather \ngot lost among the business of... saving the world at the cost of two lives. It, \nit’s borderline incomprehensible, not because of any code or cipher, there’s \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 126 – Sculptor’s Tool \n9 \n \nevery chance I could read those, just simply because most of it is numbers or \nfragments of sentences that would no doubt mean something to her, but not \nto me. I’ve been staring at it for hours in the hope something from it would just \ncome to me, and it worked well enough to point me towards this statement, \nwhich is useful background, and perhaps gives some insight into how Gertrude \nformulated her counter-rituals, but not much more. \nI’ve been trying to check on Melanie’s condition. She refuses to see me. \nUnderstandably, I, I suppose, and Basira has been looking after her. It hurt, of \ncourse, but… I really hope getting that bullet out of her helps, at least stops it \nfrom getting any worse. \nI can’t have been too late again. \n(Bitter chuckle) There was a tape recorder waiting for me when I sat down. \nThey’re not even hiding it anymore. There weren’t any tapes from when I \nwas... away. I checked. Whatever they are, they are here for me. I suppose I \nshould be worried, but I have so much to keep watch over. So, I’ve decided to \nlet the tapes run. They’ve proved useful before, so... \nI did do a small bit of follow-up on Deborah Madaki, just for my own curiosity. \nShe didn’t go to Sannikov Land in the end. I don’t know, however, whether that \nwas because she decided not to, or because shortly after this statement was \ngiven they found the body of one Mary Roundall in her basement, and she has \nspent the last nine years in Eastwood Park Prison, where she remains to this \nday. I can’t find any evidence relating to the condition of the body, but I can \nimagine what a sculptor's apprentice might be capable of, even an unwilling \none. \nEnd recording.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 4, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 4052}}
