To be in control. \nDAISY \nI’m going to kill you, someday. \nELIAS (STATEMENT) \nWhen I was eleven, I had a best friend, and his name was Calvin Benchley. We \ndidn’t hang out at school much because his friends said I couldn’t play with \nthem because I was a girl. But every day after getting home we’d go to the \nnearby park and play. It was small, just a scrap of grass and dirt, but if you \nhopped the fence to the south you could get into the cemetery, and if you \nwent the other way you got into an old building site. The fence on that side \nwas broken and jagged, but it collapsed enough that it was easy to climb over \nit, into the half-built structure. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG082 – The Eyewitnesses \n15 \n \nOur parents had forbidden us from playing there. It was collapsing, as well as \nbeing a known hang-out for vagrants and druggies. We would take turns daring \neach other to go in there. That day, I dared him. That’s why it was my fault. \nDAISY \nShut up. It wasn’t my fault. \nELIAS (STATEMENT) \nWe had been in the park, when there had been shouting from the building site. \nCrashes. Violence. Then a long silence. \nI dared him to take a look, and when he didn’t want to, I started making fun of \nhim. So in he went. When he didn’t come back, I decided he was just trying to \nspook me. But after fifteen minutes I decided he wasn’t. I wanted to run away \nand get my mum, but I was frightened of getting in trouble, so instead I \nfollowed Calvin over the fence. \nInside were the first two dead bodies I had ever seen. They looked like they \nhad attacked each other with broken glass. One lay impaled on a broken \nbottle, still holding the long shard of glass that jutted out of the other’s throat. \nThere was blood everywhere. I felt a rush of fear, and a strange sort of \nexcitement. \nDAISY \nYou can’t know that. \nELIAS (STATEMENT) \nOn a broken staircase above them, stood Calvin staring at me with vacant eyes. \nStanding behind him I saw something. A hunched figure. I think it was naked. I \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG082 – The Eyewitnesses \n16 \n \ncouldn’t see anything except pale flesh and the vivid red of cuts and injuries. \nEvery inch of its body appeared to be covered in open wounds, but no blood \nseemed to flow from them. \nThe thing was utterly still, save for a lipless, scabby mouth, which moved so \nfast it was almost a blur, silently mouthing words that only Calvin could hear. I \nknow they were for him, because with each movement of its jaw, the thing’s \nlong, pointed black tongue would shoot out and flick itself into his ear. He was \ncompletely expressionless as that crooked, cut-up figure whispered to him and \nflicked at his ear with a barbed tongue. \nDAISY \nNo. \nELIAS (STATEMENT) \nThen Calvin’s eyes turned to me. Without hesitation or expression he began \nrunning, sprinting right at me. I tried to get away, but he was faster, and \nslammed into me, pushing off my feet and into the rusted fence behind me. \nThere was an explosion of pain in my back, as jagged metal embedded itself in \nmy shoulder, and then it went dark. The last thing I remember before the \nhospital was the fierce pride on Calvin’s face as he stood there. \nNo-one believed me about what happened. Calvin said that I had tripped and \nfallen, and that was the story everyone accepted, but after that he was \ndifferent. Moody. He started getting into fights. Everyone just assumed he was \nturning into a teenager, but six children at my school were seriously injured or \nkilled by the time he left for university.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 3, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 3559}}
