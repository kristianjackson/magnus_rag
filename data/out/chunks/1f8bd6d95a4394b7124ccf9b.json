Some exist in an eternal moment, \nsome make use of memory to reflect and corrupt, but for most, time is simply \nanother thing for them to play with. To consider the future, to plan, is not \nsomething they’re capable of. \nARCHIVIST \nBut not The Web? \nANNABELLE \nNo. Not the Mother-of-Puppets, the Spinner-of-Schemes. \nBASIRA \nHang on. What about the rituals? Those were plans. \nARCHIVIST \nNo. They were... desires, filtered and interpreted by people, and the thinking \ncreatures that they spawned. \nANNABELLE \nYou are well informed, aren’t you? Exactly this. They hungered for the world, \nto step from the shadows, and gorge themselves on all humanity. \nARCHIVIST \nAnd they have. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 197 – Connected \n22 \nANNABELLE \nBut only two of them could truly conceive of such. Terminus, The End, knows \nthat in such a world they will ultimately consume themselves. And it desires \nthat finality. \nARCHIVIST \n(Realising) And The Web understands it as well. That eventually a successful \nritual would doom them all. Leave them trapped and starving in a used-up \nworld with no-one to feed on. \nBASIRA \nHang on, what? This is news to me. \nARCHIVIST \nWe passed a death domain, of The End. The victims there do actually die, \nmeaning even though it would take… I don’t know how long. Eventually The \nEnd will claim everyone and everything. It’s inevitable. \nBASIRA \nOh. (Exhales) Okay. Right. And what, the powers don’t realise? \nARCHIVIST \nThey don’t understand things like we do. But The Web is all about connections, \nunforeseen consequences. Of course, it realises. \nANNABELLE \nOf course. And knowing this, knowing for centuries you would eventually be \ntrapped, doomed to starvation, what would you do? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 197 – Connected \n23 \n(Beat) \nARCHIVIST \nPlan an escape. \nANNABELLE \nJust so. \nBASIRA \nAn escape? To where? \nARCHIVIST \nBelow us, Basira. \nANNABELLE \nThis is not “the” world, it is “a” world. And though it has taken so very long to \nprise it open, the gate to a thousand new realities now stands wide. However, \ndespite this effort, the worlds beyond them remain so far unspoiled by the \nFears’ touch. \nARCHIVIST \nThe Powers don’t exist there? They’re, what, unique to our... dimension? \nANNABELLE \nUnique? Oh, I don’t know about that, but certainly there are many, many \nworlds without them. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 197 – Connected \n24 \nBASIRA \nSorry, we’re talking about alternate dimensions now? Seriously? \nARCHIVIST \nReally, Basira? Look around us! This is where you get sceptical? \nBASIRA \n(Remaining skeptical) Yeah. \n(Beat) \n[Some chitinous, rewinding tape sounds pass] \nOkay, cut me some slack. This is a lot of new and weird information. \nARCHIVIST \nSo The Web, it wants to spread? To escape into new realities? \nANNABELLE \nYes, but not alone. Any attempt to separate the Fears is ultimately doomed, as \nyou well know. \nARCHIVIST \nBut how? \nANNABELLE \nWe found the one we believed most likely to bring about their manifestation. \nWe marked him young, guided his path as best we could. And then, we took \nhis voice. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 197 – Connected \n25 \nARCHIVIST \nNo… \nANNABELLE \nHis, and those he walked with. We inscribed them on shining strands of word \nand meaning, and used them to weave a web which cast itself out through the \ngate and beyond our universe. So that when the Fears heard that voice, and \ncame in their terrible glory, they might then travel out along it. \nOr be dragged. \nBASIRA \nIs she talking about the tapes? \nARCHIVIST \nYes. \nBASIRA \nSo, how is any of this a solution? \nARCHIVIST \nBecause for the Fears to spread into these new worlds, they would need to \nleave ours, wouldn’t they? \nANNABELLE \nIf one should leave this place for… greener pastures, the rest must follow. \nARCHIVIST \nLeaving us behind in the process, freeing our world at the cost of others. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 197 – Connected \n26 \nBASIRA \nWhat are you saying? \nARCHIVIST \nWe can pass them our apocalypse. \n(Muffled discomfited realisation from Martin) \nANNABELLE \nNothing so extreme. In these new worlds they would exist as they used to in \nours, lurking just beyond the threshold. \nARCHIVIST \nUntil someone is stupid enough to release them there as well. \nANNABELLE \nPerhaps. Even the Mother cannot see the future. Only try to shape it. \nARCHIVIST \nAnd so they spread through realities like a disease! \nANNABELLE \nPerhaps. \nARCHIVIST \n…I won’t do it. \nANNABELLE \nPossibly.
