I knew some real \nscrew-ups back in my police days, but nothing that even came close to Hector \nLerado. I genuinely had no idea how he ended up working for these guys, who I \neventually pegged as Ukrainian mafia. I suppose he did look like the last person \nyou’d suspect of running drugs, but that was the only thing he had going for \nhim. In addition to being unbelievably oblivious, he was also sloppy and \nforgetful. I once watched him leave the suitcase, drugs and all, on his front \nporch for three hours in broad daylight, before he remembered and came back \nfor it. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG049 – The Butcher’s Window \n6 \n \nIronically, I didn’t actually see him lose the drugs. I’d needed to use the \nbathroom in a coffee shop I’d followed him to and when I got out, he’d moved \non. Sometime in the two hours it took me to find him again, he’d managed to \nput the suitcase down and forget it. It was gone. I saw realisation cross his face \nas he began to panic. This was bad news for both of us. Worse for him, of \ncourse, but it did mean that I wouldn’t be making my bonus. \nI followed him a while longer out of morbid curiosity and watched as he tried \nto explain himself to the Ukrainians. I expected anger, a beating, maybe even a \nmurder right then and there, but instead they just exchanged a look, mumbled \na few words to Hector and handed him a small slip of paper. Then they drove \naway. Hector looked at the paper, typed something into his phone and threw it \naway as he walked off. It was an address in Stockwell and an instruction: ‘Ask \nfor Jared’. \nI didn’t follow him that time. I was pretty sure they’d just handed the poor \nidiot a death sentence, and when Nicola called the next day to say Hector \nhadn’t come home, I was sure. At this point, I came clean to her about her \nhusband’s activities, although I did lie about the timings to make it seem like \nI’d only just discovered about the drugs – no need for her to know why I’d kept \nit to myself. When I told her about the loss and the note, she sat down, clearly \ntrying to process everything. She didn’t seem particularly broken up over the \nfact that her husband was most likely dead, something that was quickly \nconfirmed as she started moving on to talking about savings and life insurance. \nThat’s when I should have taken my payment and gone. If I hadn’t gotten \ngreedy, I’d still have my arm. \nSo, I was all set to leave, when Nicola asked me how long I thought it was going \nto be before they found a body.
