I still hadn’t seen any other cars on the road or, as I \nthought more about it, people on the streets. But as you might imagine, \ngetting out of there proved even more difficult than finding the house I was \nlooking for. Every time I thought I’d found a main road that led out of this \nweird looping suburbia, a one-way sign seemed to spring up, directing me back \ninto the sprawl. I did U-turn after U-turn as I was channelled into one dead-end \ncul-de-sac after another, until eventually I decided to simply disregard the one-\nway signs completely. I cruised past the one that seemed to be blocking my \nmost likely exit, and almost breathed a sigh of relief, as I found myself leaving \nthe suburban maze I’d been trapped in. Until it led me into an entirely \ndifferent maze of unremarkable residential neighbourhoods. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 150 – Cul-de-Sac \n \n6 \n \nEven then, I still didn’t accept that I was trapped. It didn’t make any sense. And \nit wasn’t like I’d seen anything blatantly supernatural. It wasn’t that there was \nanything abnormal about the whole situation. It was just that the normal \nseemed to go on forever. At some point, I got out of the car and started \nhammering on random doors. I mean, I tried the doorbells at first, but they \nwere silent, so I started knocking and knocking until my hand hurt. There was \nno answer at any of them. There were no lights on behind the drawn curtains, \nand all the house numbers were zero. \nI got back into my car and started driving again, going on and on until finally I \nran out of petrol, and it rolled to a sputtering stop at the end of one of the \nindistinguishable dead ends. It had been full dark for hours by this point, and \nmy dashboard claimed it was 3am. My phone had died about an hour ago, and \nonce the last of the power went in the car, I was left with no way to tell the \ntime at all. I wished I hadn’t thrown away the wristwatch Alberto had given \nme, but it was too late for those regrets. I stepped outside, looking down the \nstreet. There were no lights on in any of the houses, but the identical \nlampposts bathed the place in a sickly orange as far as I could see. I decided \nthat the roads must be the problem – they were what was keeping me trapped \nin this place, constantly turning and bending and confusing me. If I just picked \na direction and kept to it, eventually I had to get to the edge of what, by now, I \nhad decided was a newly built neighbourhood that apparently no-one had \nmoved into yet. As an explanation, it didn’t make any sense, but it didn’t need \nto, not at that moment. \nSo, I started walking, going around houses and through gardens, trying at all \ntimes to keep my direction straight and consistent. I may be too old for \nclubbing, but I still keep pretty active, so getting over the fences wasn’t too", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 3, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 2832}}
