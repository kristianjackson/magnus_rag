I mean, we had a counter terrorist firearms \nsquad with us, which didn’t exactly put my mind at ease. That said, I wasn’t \nexactly sad we might be getting some sectioned firearms officers, but it was \njust a lot, you know? The briefing was pretty short. We were told that Callum \nBrodie had been found and it was suspected he was being held by a man \nnamed Maxwell Rayner, with an unknown number of accomplices. There were \nsuspicions that there might be cult involvement. That’s when I phoned you. \nARCHIVIST \nAnd did the lights help at all? \nBASIRA \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG073 – Police Lights \n4 \n \nOh, I’m... I’m getting to that. I told the sergeant, and he didn’t even ask me \nwhere I’d gotten the information. He just nodded and told everyone to load up \non torches. The firearms team wasn’t short on tactical gear so, by the time we \nheaded inside, we had two or three heavy duty flashlights each. I had four. \nThe building was in an industrial complex up in Harringay. It was a two storey \nbrick building with a weathered sign claiming it belonged to Outer Bay \nShipping. We were instructed to go inside in teams of two, with one armed \nofficer paired with one sectioned. You... you have to understand, that was \nmassively against protocol, but I guess they wanted to be sure that none of the \nfirearms team encountered anything weird without being accompanied by \nanyone experienced. I looked around to see if the others were going to make \nanything of it, but no-one made a peep. I think everyone knew that this was \nabout as far from a normal operation as they came. \nI was paired with an older guy. Goodman, I think his name was, though we \ndidn’t really talk. The way he carried his weapon in the van, I could tell he'd \nbeen handling it awhile, but I couldn’t help but notice his hands were shaking \nslightly as we made our way around the building. We were going in through \nthe loading dock at the rear, and as we approached the security lights that lit \nthe rest of the estate seemed to get dimmer. Well, not dimmer, really, they \njust didn’t illuminate the place as much as they should have. Aside from a small \npool of white light directly below, the darkness around them didn’t seem to be \naffected. I didn’t have much time to think about it before the order came down \nand we were going in. \nI cut the padlock on the metal gate and slid it up while Goodman gave me \nsome cover. The inside seemed normal. Pallets of boxes were neatly lined up \non shelves around the loading bay, and the heavy lamps overhead gave us \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG073 – Police Lights \n5 \n \nplenty of light. We started to make a sweep of the area, eyes peeled for \nanything that looked out of place. I took a second to check a few of the larger \nboxes but they didn’t contain anything remarkable. Mostly sheets of plastic for \nmanufacturing, although some were full of copper piping or paint. And that’s \nwhen I heard the scream. \nIt came from behind one of the shelves to my left and it didn’t sound like a cry \nof fear or pain. It was a scream of rage, almost animal-like, and when I turned I \nsaw a figure moving behind me. It was only for a second, but it seemed to be \ndressed head to toe in black, like a leotard or one of those morphsuits. It was \nhard to say for sure, as it was less than a second before it darted back behind \nthe shelves and Goodman opened fire. \nI hadn’t prepared myself for it, and the sudden gunshot sent a jolt of pain \nshooting through my head as my eardrums rang with the noise. Goodman \ncalled something to me but I couldn’t make out a word of it. I just followed him \nas he ran around to where the figure had disappeared to. There was no sign of \nit, although a small spray of fresh blood told me that my jumpy new partner’s \naim had been too wide of the mark. \nWe... we started to hear sporadic gunfire from the rest of the building. I mean, \nit was basically all I could hear at that point as everything else was still a \nmuffled, high-pitched whine. I was worried Goodman might panic at this, but \nto his credit he seemed to have pulled himself together and we finished the \nsweep of the loading bay before heading through to the rest of the building. I \nsaw a handful of armed officers heading up the stairs to the upper floor, and I \nwas going to follow them when I felt a tug on my arm. Goodman was... he was \ns", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 1, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 4500}}
