She didn’t remember the interview, not \nproperly. Or had it been a trial? \n[Footsteps, then sounds of sitting on the metal bench] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nThere had been a man, she was certain of it, and he had smiled as he sat across \nfrom her. And there had been a file, a thick manila envelope stained with \ngrease and coffee, which held the pages of her life typed out in a small, no-\nnonsense font. She remembered that she had read those pages with increasing \nalarm. It had all been there, all of it. Her life, her loves, her choices, her \nmistakes. No details spared, no nasty inference ignored. There was no benefit \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 185 – Locked In \n \n8 \nof the doubt here, no understanding or kindness, only the disinterested ink of \nwords that would see her prosecuted. \n“None of these things are illegal,” she had said. \nThe man had laughed at that. It had been a dry and hacking sound that cracked \nthe mirrored glass of the interview room, and made the juror’s ears bleed. He \nstroked his badge… or had it been that gnarled and bloodstained gavel? \n“The laws have changed.” \nAnd now she is back in her cell. Or a cell that looks like hers. It is smaller, \nperhaps, the metal bench is cleaner, but rusted through on the hinges, so \nwhen she lies on it, it squeals and threatens to collapse. They never told her \nany charges, never gave her any verdict. She is certain she will see that man, \nthe judge or the detective or the warden, she will see him again. Perhaps she \nwill be moved, or written up, or reprimanded. The cold is settling in, the \nhunger is biting her as she tries to sleep. There has been a mistake. She should \nnot be here, but she had met the person in charge, she had pleaded her case, \ntold him of what had happened. And he had laughed at her. \n[Metallic slide, followed by wet slopping and slapping sounds, and \nsome metal bangs] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nA tray slides under the door, spilling thin, watery stew over the floor, tipping \nout chunks of something that glistens and writhes. Tina ignores it as she grabs \nthe hatch and tries to keep it open, tries to tell the guard, to explain what’s \nhappened, that something’s gone wrong, that she shouldn’t be here. This isn’t \nright! Why can’t anybody see this? This isn’t the place for people like her. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 185 – Locked In \n \n9 \n[Metallic slamming, followed by cloth movement] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nThe hatch slams shut on her fingers and she pulls her hand back, pain robbing \nher voice of protest for a moment. Outside the window, night has fallen and \nthe temperature starts dropping even further. Perhaps if she behaved they \nwould give her a blanket? Perhaps she could see other people, share her story \nof injustice? Tina tells herself so many lies, as she shivers in the dark. The \nmoonlight falls on those old and faded scratch marks on the concrete wall, and \nas she places her hand on the shallow grooves, they match her fingers \nperfectly. \n[Sounds of scratching stone] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nShe refuses to count the tally marks that cover every inch. \n[Hissing static starts] \n[In the background, a subdued version of the prison] \n[Metal door creaks open into a small, echoey room] \n[Hissing static ends] \nMARTIN \nAll done? \nARCHIVIST \nYes. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 185 – Locked In \n \n10 \nMARTIN \nI still think doing it in one of the actual cells was a bit much. \nARCHIVIST \nIt was the most soundproof place I could find. \nMARTIN \nPffft. Soundproof? Yeah, dream on. \nARCHIVIST \nYou… heard? I-I’m sorry. I know it was— \nMARTIN \nI-I actually didn’t, but only ‘cause I was too busy hearing what was going on in \nall the other cells. \nARCHIVIST \nAh. Well, they seem to have quieted for a while at least. \nMARTIN \nYeah, one of those... things, passed by just now, and everyone shut right up. \nARCHIVIST \nMm. The jailors have that effect. \nShall we go? \nMARTIN \nWhat if another one comes along? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 185 – Locked In \n \n11 \nARCHIVIST \nIt’s fine. We’re, uh, we’re ‘guests of the Warden’. \nMARTIN \nEurgh. \nARCHIVIST \nMm-hmm. Come on. \n[The metal door creaks as they walk out, continuing down a \ncorridor] \n(Beat) \nMARTIN \nDoes it not bother you? \nARCHIVIST \nWhat? Being a ‘guest’? \nMARTIN \nYeah. I-It’s-It’s not like it resisted. Hell, it was chummy. \nARCHIVIST \nWould you rather it had attacked? \nMARTIN \nNo it’s just... Is that how these creatures see us now?
