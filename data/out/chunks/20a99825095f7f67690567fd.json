Statement recorded direct from subject, 7th January 2017. \nStatement begins. \nTESSA (STATEMENT) \nHave you ever heard of Sergei Yushanka? I’d guess not. He’s one of the less \nwell-known online spook stories and you don’t look like you’re a regular \npresence in the chatbot or neural net communities. The story goes back to \nabout 1983, during the first home computer boom. There was this \nprogrammer by the name of Sergei Yushanka. I don’t know if that’s his real \nname. Probably not, since a Yushanka is a type of furry Russian hat, and he \nprobably never actually existed, but he was supposed to have been a real \ndigital guru. Well, according to the story, he... he got sick. In most versions, it’s, \num... it’s brain cancer, but some say early onset Alzheimer’s or some sort of \nundiagnosed brain infection. The point is, it was killing him and it affected his \nbrain. Now Sergei didn’t want to die. The idea of death terrified him and \nwhatever was eating his mind gave him the idea to try and save his \nconsciousness. To, um... to upload his brain. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 065 – Binary \n7 \n \nWell, the next bit it, um … it depends on how ghoulish a version of the story \nyou’re told. In some, he spends a fortune and every last hour of his last months \ntrying desperately to code his own mind into his system, and he ends up lying \ndead at the keyboard, decomposing fingers still tapping away the last slivers of \nhimself. Other versions get a bit more grotesque – handwritten code in his \nown blood feeding into the machine. I even heard one where he took the \ndirect approach – removed the casing of his computer, carved off the top of his \nskull and used the last ounces of his strength to impossibly shove his own \ndiseased brain right into the circuitry. Whatever version you’re told, the story \ngoes that it actually worked and the police found a pile of floppy disks full of \nimpossible code next to the mutilated body of Sergei Yushanka. \nI’m sure you can guess the next bit. First on floppy disks, then later on CD and \neventually downloaded directly, Sergei Yushanka has been a running prank for \npeople who like to code, text parsers and chatbots. They’re not unlike \nscreamer videos, just a lot slower, and ideally, subtler. You create a program \nwhich appears to be a chat window with a stranger, who identifies themselves \nas Sergei. The responses should be as naturalistic as possible to begin with and \nin the best ones it’s hard to tell if you’re talking to a bot for the first minute or \ntwo. But then the responses start to breakdown, become more sinister and \nkeep referring to how much pain Sergei is in. Eventually, the only response the \nbot gives you is screaming and pleas to be released. \nThe idea is that the chatbot is Sergei Yushanka’s mind and he doesn’t like being \nin a computer nearly as much as he’d hoped. If it’s well-executed it can be \ngenuinely quite unsettling. The only two consistent details across all of them \nare a particular image of a heavily pixelated screaming face and the phrase, \n“The angles cut me when I try to think”, which marks the start of the bot’s", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 2, "chunk_count": 9, "chars": 4413}}
