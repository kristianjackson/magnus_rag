But in the city, there is \nno stillness, no privacy. The swell is that of rank, sweaty humanity, and to press \nthrough them is to work the dirt and dust that infuses the air into your own \nskin. The stink is deeper than just a simple smell. \n \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG108 – Monologue \n \n2 \n \nI suppose I am lucky that my work takes me out only rarely during the middle \nof the day. I am an actor, by trade, and both skilled and fortunate enough to \nfind myself employed more often than not. I am not sure I would say I enjoy it, \nnecessarily, but I do find a certain fulfilment in it. I remember the first time I \nfelt the calling. I was nine years old, visiting my grandparents in Athens, and \nmy parents had taken me on a trip to see the great amphitheatre. It was \nwinter, not the season for tourists, my parents were off in a corner somewhere \narguing, but just for a moment, I had the place entirely to myself. And I felt it, \nthat strange centring. That spot at the core of everything where you, and you \nalone, speak. Your words heard by no-one, and in that no-one, the entire \nuniverse. \n \nYes, I am aware that normally there is, unless something has gone badly \nwrong, an audience, or at the very least other actors with which to trade \ndialogue. And that’s fine, but that is not what I live for. I live for the \nmonologue, when all others fade away and the light tightens on me, excluding \nall else. Have you ever had stage lights in your eyes? The brightness steals \neverything else, and if it’s strong enough, you can look out into the audience \nand see nothing at all. Just you. I am a fine actor, and a very capable physical \nperformer, but all that is simply the dues I pay to earn my way to a monologue. \n \nFor the last two weeks I have been performing the part of Jaques in As You Like \nIt. Do you know you Shakespeare? Well, it’s not the greatest production of the \nplay, which can be very funny if done right. The director, a man name David \nAustin, has neither the vision nor the spark to turn it into something truly \nmemorable, and the reviews reflect that. I don’t care, though. That’s not why I \ndo it. You see, there is one part of As You Like It that almost every English-", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 0, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 2918}}
