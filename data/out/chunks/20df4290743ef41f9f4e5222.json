But \nthat never really happened. Instead, he stopped contacting me completely. He \nstill answered the phone when I called, but was polite when I went to check \nupon him. Every bit of communication had to be instigated by me. \nAnd he had gotten… cleaner. I didn’t think it was possible, but every time I \nwent over there, the smell of bleach was almost overwhelming. More often \nthan not he was wearing rubber cleaning gloves when he opened the door, and \nas I walked around I could feel his eyes making note of everywhere I walked, \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG093 – Contaminant \n4 \n \neverything I touched. I tried to talk to him about it, suggest he get help, but \nwhenever I mentioned it he would try to change the subject, and talk about \ntelevision or news, though… if I tried, it became clear he didn’t actually follow \neither. \nFinally, I decided I just couldn’t stand it any more. I sat him down, and told him \nthat if he didn’t talk to someone about his compulsions, I was going to have to \nset something up for him. I told him that whatever he was doing, it wasn’t the \nright way to deal with Sandra and Dani’s death. I didn’t handle it well. I was still \ndeep in grief myself, and I almost broke down, pleading with him, telling him it \nwasn’t healthy. When I said that, he laughed. He actually threw his head back \nand laughed. It was one of the most unnerving sounds I’d ever heard. \nGreg stood up, walked over to a small cabinet in his kitchen, and opened it to \nreveal row upon row of individually packaged miniatures of gin. He picked up \none of them up and inspected it, checking the top and bottom, and examining \nthe seal to make sure it was unbroken. Then, in one swift motion he opened \nthe tiny bottle, and emptied it down his throat. He did this three times before \nhe finally looked back at me. His gaze was softened by the alcohol, but it still \nlooked like an almost physical effort for him to force out the words. \n“There is mould in my drain.” That’s all he said. Not all that strange a sentence, \nall things considered, especially in that context. But something in his face, \nsomething in the way he pressed those words out through his lips made me \nsuddenly feel cold all over. I made my excuses and left. He didn’t look up as I \nclosed the front door behind me. \nI tried to forget, tried to just move on and ignore it. If he didn’t want my help, \nthen I had no business trying to force it on him. But I couldn’t do it. He was \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG093 – Contaminant \n5 \n \nDani’s father, my last connection to her. I don’t believe in ghosts, or the \nafterlife, or anything like that, but I knew she would have wanted me to do \nsomething. Dani never gave up on anyone. \nWork wasn’t expecting me back for another few weeks, and Dani had had a \nsolid life insurance policy, so there wasn’t any problem booking a decent hotel \nroom for a week in Newcastle. I knew that my father-in-law would never allow \nme to stay in his home, not at that point, but he couldn’t stop me being \nnearby. So I started to check in on him every day. I brought him hot meals, and \ntalked to him for hours, even when he didn’t want to talk back. But none of it \nseemed to weaken the cleaning compulsion that had taken hold of him. If \nanything, after a few days I noticed that I had adopted the habit of cleaning my \nhands a second time before leaving the hotel bathroom. Greg wouldn’t let me \nuse his. \nOn the fifth day, I did see inside his bathroom, though. I won’t go into details, \nbut suffice to say my use of it was over his protests. It was just as clean as the \nrest of the house. Beyond clean, really, as I could see some of the enamel \nfittings had been worn down, and the tile grouting and sealant around the sink \nwere starting to corrode. I shook my head and turned to leave, but as I did so, I \nsaw a small flash of colour in the bath. I pulled back the white curtain and \nlooked down. Surrounding the edges of the plug’s pristine chrome was a small \nhalo of purple. I leaned over to get a closer look. It appeared to be some sort of \nfungus, scrubbed away so only the faintest traces remained. There was a \nspongy, fibrous look to it, and I had the sudden image of long, soft tendrils \nstretching away down through the pipes. It was the colour of a fresh bruise \nand smelled sour, like old milk.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 1, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 4485}}
