I mean, when I stepped out the building that \nmorning, I didn’t turn towards the bus stop, like I always do. I turned right \ninstead, and walked over toward the little alleyway where I knew, sometime in \nthe next week, a young woman was going to have a fatal aneurysm. \nAnd there they were, on the concrete, like a starburst of fleshy roots, \nspreading and reaching out from the spot where her head was going to hit the \nground. They moved just like in the dreams, throbbing and pulsing. I had to \ntake a moment, just to be sure, just to be completely sure that I was awake. \nFelt like I was staring at it for hours, but I don’t think it was much more than a \nfew minutes. They didn’t fade, didn’t vanish, and there was no way for me to \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 121 – Far Away \n \n4 \n \npretend that they weren’t there. So, I reached out my hand and tried to touch \nthem. \nYou know what’s weird, right? In all my years of being a... what am I? Death \nprophet? Whatever... I had never actually touched a corpse, hardly ever even \nseen one in real life. I could have told you in a moment how many people in \nthis hospital were going to die, how many would do it tonight, even how it was \ngoing to happen, but I had never once actually come up close to a dead body. I \nalways assumed they were cold, not quite damp but sort of clammy. And still. \nThis was like ice. No, colder than ice, the sort of cold that just cuts right \nthrough you. It was soft and rubbery, squirming when I pressed on it and \nrecoiling from the tip of my finger. I’ve never felt anything as cold as those \nveins. It was so… patient. It made me think of those winter mornings when I \nwas a kid, with no snow, just frost and frozen mist over everything, keeping the \nworld in place, curling you up into yourself and quietly waiting for you to lose \nyour footing, to slip up and fall. Snap. It made me think of dead worlds floating \nout into space, places that didn’t know and didn’t care that life even existed. It \nmade me think of mortality, like the seconds that were dragging me to the \ngrave were being pulled out of me. And the worst part was that somewhere in \nme I… I liked it. Underneath all that awful fear, it felt like home. \nAfter that happened, they wouldn’t leave me alone. I could see them \nspreading, see them growing. Even when I went to your institute, tried to warn \nher, I could see them crawling through the corridors towards the Archives. \nThey never got quite as big as they were in my dreams, but it wasn’t long \nbefore I was seeing them all the time. I tried to avoid them, of course I did, but \nsometimes I didn’t notice and I would brush against them. Never mattered \nwhat I was wearing; the cold would just cut through it like a razor.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 1, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 2740}}
