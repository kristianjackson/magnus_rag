It didn’t \nseem like they’d moved an inch, though as I went to take Montauk back to his \ncell, I noticed that he was crying. I didn’t mention it. I’ll be honest, I was kind of \nfreaked out by the whole thing. \nThe next few months were quiet. Montauk seemed even more subdued than \nnormal and often had to be goaded into exercising during his allotted time. The \nonly point where he seemed normal was when his daughter came for her visits \nand maybe that was just because he was already so used to lying to her. That \nwas the summer we had all the plumbing problems in the ERU and the water \nkept going foul, so we were all kind of on edge. But nothing really happened \nuntil it turned to autumn and November rolled around. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG052 – Exceptional Risk \n14 \n \nIt was November 1st. I remember because the date was read out so many \ndamn times in the assorted disciplinaries that followed. The worst part of it is, I \nwasn’t even doing anything wrong that day. I was working the late shift with \nPete and we were having coffee in the break room. At least, I was having \ncoffee. Pete was swearing at the taps because the plumbing problem we had \nall been assured was fixed was back and worse than ever. The taps were \ndisgorging a jet of foul-smelling, stagnant water. I was laughing at him, sipping \nmy own perfectly adequate drink, when all the lights went off. It was more \nwidespread than last time though. It seemed like the electricity had gone off \naltogether. \nWe stood there in the pitch black, waiting for the generator to kick in, or for \nwhatever power problem this was to be fixed. But after a few minutes of \nsilence and darkness, it became clear that that wasn’t happening any time \nsoon. In the distance we could hear the prisoners of the Exceptional Risk Unit \nstart to shout and holler. Their cells were locked, of course – there was nothing \na power cut to do about that. But it was still up to us to keep order until the \nlights came back. \nI had hoped that the other prison officers on shift would have come by to pick \nus up, but they were clearly busy elsewhere. I called out to Pete, making sure \nhe was still nearby as I fumbled in the locker for my torch. I finally found it and \nturned it on. The beam was so bright in the oppressive darkness that I had to \nblink away tears. Using the light from mine, Pete found his own flashlight and \ntogether we headed out into the CSC. We checked each cell in turn, lying to \nthe prisoners inside about when the power would be back and sending them \nback to their beds with threats of violence. I didn’t see any of the other \nwarders around and was starting to get really nervous.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 5, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 2724}}
