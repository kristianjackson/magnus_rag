He shakes off such thoughts. The ants remain as small to him as ever, \nand as numerous. He chooses the tighter passage. \n[The dirt and tunnel movements continue, matching the statement] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nPressed so closely there can be fewer of them inside, and those that come for \nhim will be quickly crushed. Or so he hopes. And as he presses himself through \nthe jagged stone, it seems as if he has calculated correctly. The sharp scraping \nof rock is almost a relief after the tickling itch he has been enduring for so long, \nas they tear at his ragged clothes that never fully rip, and always leave crevices \nenough for ants to hide. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 184 – Like Ants \n4 \nThere are few ants in this tunnel, so few that Jordan can barely feel them on \nhim. At least, until they begin to bite, and the shooting pains begin to rip \nthrough him. He jerks wildly, trying to reach his tormentors to brush them off \nor kill them, but the tunnel is too narrow and keeps his arms pinned to his \nsides. He flails, cutting his back against the ceiling, and freezes, the panicked \nthought gripping him, the image of those ants crawling down, into his wounds, \ninto his skin, hollowing him out and making their colony tunnels of his veins. \nHe screams, a wordless, haggard cry of despair. \n[The close sound of the ant swarm transitions to a small echoing \nchamber; the ants are here but less omnipresent; dirt and pebbles \nfall every so often] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nLeto hears the scream, echoing down through chamber after chamber of his \nfriends, but he does not understand it. He waits for it to end, looking for its \nsource, but it just seems to go on and on and on. Eventually he does not hear \nit, though he cannot say for certain that it has stopped. He wants to \ninvestigate, to see what sort of creature could make such a sound, but there is \nno step he can take that does not make him a murderer. He cannot stand or sit \nor shift without a hundred of those dearest to him paying for it with their lives. \nOnce, so long ago now that it seems almost like a memory of a dream, he knew \nthese creatures, and they had known him. They had covered him, swarmed \nand embraced him, and he had, for a short, glorious time, known what it was \nto be loved on an unimaginable scale. For each and every ant was a life, a mind \nno lesser than his own, guided by senses utterly alien yet as vital as any he \npossessed. If we are as ants to those things above us that torment and toy with \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 184 – Like Ants \n5 \nus for their amusement, why should not ants be like us, each with a life as rich \nand intricate as any person? \nLeto knows this to be true, as for that all too brief a time his senses were \nattuned to theirs, and he knew them, truly knew them. Unnumbered minds \nand existences, all connected together as one, and they had loved him. When \nhe thinks of it, it prickles his eyes with regret at the loss, the endless rolling \nmass of love that he had all but begged to consume him. \nBut it is gone. His friends, the minds that he had once known so intimately, had \nleft him. Now he sees them, moving and pulsing around him in a steady tide of \ntiny bodies, but he cannot reach them as once he did. He cannot make them \nunderstand, and he cannot apologise as his movements, as every gesture of his \ngrotesque, lumbering body ends a dozen, a hundred existences. Even the tears \nthat Leto sheds in grief will fall and drown his friends. He holds his arms in \nclose and tries not to move. \n[Earth shifts and crumbles, and there are footsteps] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nThere is someone else here now, someone shouting at him. The voice, it is the \none who was screaming in the tunnels. He is still screaming, yelling something \nat Leto. Blood drips from all over him, matted into his hair, crusting his lips \nwith red. \n[Footsteps turn into stamping] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nHe flails his arms wildly and stamps his feet, pulping a mass of ants, ending \ntheir lives with such a cruel and callous disregard that Leto is filled with a", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 1, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 4108}}
