I just wanted \nto come over and set things straight, apologise for any of your time that he \nmight have wasted. He’s just a lonely old man looking for attention and trying \nto manipulate me into moving back in with him, even though I’ve told him so \nmany times that that’s just not going to happen. The doors thing isn’t even his, \nyou know? That’s what he talked to you about, right? Some magically \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 146 – Threshold \n \n2 \n \nappearing door? Yeah, well, he’s just trying to send me a message, which has \nbeen received loud and clear. \nI suppose I do probably owe you some sort of explanation. (Sighs) Right. I’d \nbeen living with my parents a while. I kept moving out, but it never seemed to \nstick. First was uni; fine, moving back in after a degree is normal. Then there \nwas my divorce back in ’93 – that landed me back in my old room for a while. \nThen my company went bust about four years ago and wiped out all my \nsavings. All told, I must have spent most of my twenties, and not a small \namount of my thirties, living in that house, with my mum and dad. It was \nalright, but each time the vibe was worse. \nMy mum was always happy to have me, but she wanted me to move on with \nmy life. But Dad was weirdly protective of me, kept trying to keep me around, \nlike he was terrified that the world outside was going to hurt me. I was quite \ndepressed back then and his attitude put me in a really weird headspace. I \nthink it comes back to the doors, you know? I think he always secretly thought \nthat I had some deep-seated mental illness, even though they did so many \ntests and the doors were the only things that it ever was. Aside from the \ndepression, obviously. But they were just specific, weird little hallucinations \nthat have long-since stopped. Haven’t had one in ... Well, it’s not important. \nBut my dad always thought it was a sign of something deeper, something that \nwas … something that was going to destroy me one day. So, whenever I was \nliving at home, he smothered me, tried desperately to keep me around. \nDon’t you see? That’s what this whole thing is all about. He’s been so lonely \nsince Mum died and he is trying to get me to move back in with him. He’s \npretending that he is starting to see the doors. He thinks if he pretends to \nshare in my “madness”, as he always called it, then I’ll be worried about him,", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 0, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 2937}}
