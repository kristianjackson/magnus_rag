I don’t believe so, no, but the Spider’s strings are \nsubtle, so I suppose it’s not impossible. Why? \nARCHIVIST \nI want to know. Can The Web control another avatar, one that serves a \ndifferent power? Make them do things they don’t want to. Make them find \nvictims, feed. \n(Helen laughs.) \nHELEN \nPerhaps. Perhaps not. Would that make life easier for you? Are you so sure you \ndidn’t want to? \n(Helen laughs again.) \n[The Archivist slams door. The tape clicks off. The tape clicks on.] \nARCHIVIST \nBeen a while since you’ve all come to see me together. I assume it’s not good \nnews. \nDAISY \nNo. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 146 – Threshold \n \n12 \n \nMELANIE \nWhat the hell have you been doing, John? \nBASIRA \nMartin left a tape for us. \n[Basira throws the tape onto the table.] \nARCHIVIST \nAnd what exactly is on this— Oh. \nMELANIE \nYes. \nBASIRA \nHow many? \nARCHIVIST \nBasira, I— \nBASIRA \nHow many? \nARCHIVIST \nFour. \nMELANIE \nJesus. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 146 – Threshold \n \n13 \n \nBASIRA \nIncluding the one on the boat? \nDAISY \nWhat one on the boat? \nARCHIVIST \nIncluding Floyd, five. \nMELANIE \nJesus. \nBASIRA \nDo I even want to know? \nMELANIE \nI do. \nARCHIVIST \nJess Tirrell, the woman on the tape, she was the fourth. I’d just tried to... I was \nweak, ravenous. I didn’t feel... The first was a supermarket cleaner, ended up \nlost for a weak in an endless warehouse. I didn’t even... I just went in for some \nshopping and he was there and I just... asked. The second was… It was after I \ngot stabbed by Melanie. \nMELANIE \nYou are not putting this on me. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 146 – Threshold \n \n14 \n \nARCHIVIST \nNo, that’s not what I meant. I was walking the streets; I thought I was trying to \nclear my head. \nDAISY \nBut you were hunting. \nARCHIVIST \nApparently. And I found a woman who, every year on her birthday, wakes up in \na fresh grave, just for her. \nDAISY \nAnd the third was after the coffin. \nARCHIVIST \nA man rejected by all who knew him, searching ever darker places for love. \nWhen he told me his story, he started weeping maggots. \nBASIRA \nEnough. \nARCHIVIST \nI hope so. \nMELANIE \nWhy didn’t you record them? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 146 – Threshold \n \n15 \n \nBASIRA \nWhy do you think? Because he was ashamed. \nARCHIVIST \nNo, I don’t … I mean, I don’t record anything anymore, not really. I just assume \nthey’ll turn on if it’s important. \nBASIRA \nWell, they didn’t. \nARCHIVIST \nNo, I suppose not. \nMELANIE \nSo, what do we do now? \nARCHIVIST \nI don’t know. \nBASIRA \nYou’re a danger, John, a monster. You’re hurting innocent people. \nARCHIVIST \nSo did Daisy. \nBASIRA \nShut up! It’s not the same thing at all! \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 146 – Threshold \n \n16 \n \nDAISY \nBasira, he has a point. \nBASIRA \nYou didn’t know what you were doing, and since you did, you’ve spent every \nwaking hour resisting. He knows exactly what he’s doing. \nARCHIVIST \nI don’t ... It’s not that simple. It feels ... I don’t know if I can control it. I don’t \nknow if it’s even me doing it. \nBASIRA \nSo, you say you’re being controlled? \nARCHIVIST \nI don’t know. Maybe. The Web... \nBASIRA \nWhat was the name you said before? Annabelle Cane? \nARCHIVIST \nYes. She’s been watching us; I’m pretty sure of it. \nDAISY \nJohn, I’m not sure that it’s actua— \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 146 – Threshold \n \n17 \n \nBASIRA \nNo. No, if he is being controlled, we need to know, and we need to know now. \nDo you know where she is? \nARCHIVIST \nN-not properly. I think she has some connection to Hill Top Road? \nBASIRA \nThen we go, now. Unless anyone has any objections? \nARCHIVIST \nNot from me. \nBASIRA \nYou don’t get a vote. \nMELANIE \nOkay, seriously, I’m going to have to be the one to point out that this is a \nterrible idea. \nBASIRA \nDaisy? \nDAISY \nBe better if we could prepare. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 146 – Threshold \n \n18 \n \nMELANIE \nI just think that we shouldn’t be exposing ourselves like this until we have a \nlittle bit more than a hunch. \nARCHIVIST \nShe does have a point. \nMELANIE \nI didn’t ask you. \nBASIRA \nOkay, fine, I’ll go then. I’ll do some recon on my own and update you. \nMELANIE \nWait, hang on. \nDAISY \nBasira. \nBASIRA \nI’ll tell you all what I find. Don’t let him eat anyone’s brain while I’m gone. \nARCHIVIST \nThat’s not what I do. \nMELANIE \nBut, Basira, come, come on!", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 5, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 4364}}
