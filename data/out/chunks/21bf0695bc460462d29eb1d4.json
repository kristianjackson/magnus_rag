Bits \nof some of the chapters that I really don’t remember from the version I read \nbefore. The book’s old and dirty and kind of tricky to just read, so I copied \ndown a few passages for you. \nSo, almost halfway through, Chapter Thirteen, he talks about “The Men with \nthe Spades” - the soldiers who came up every day to dig the graves for those \nwho had died in the hospital. He describes them as “unkempt and uncaring, \ntheir devil-may-care attitude hiding the deep sadness within them at their \nsolemn duty”. Except, in the version I have, it goes like this: \n\nArchivist’s note: attached to this statement at various points are handwritten \nversions of passages allegedly from the book in question. \n“The graves at Frere were dug by our own men, or rather, by a small fatigue \nparty from a regiment nearby. Nearly every morning they came, the men with \nthe spades. There were seven of them, with a corporal, and they came up \njauntily, with their spades on their shoulders and their pipes in their mouths. \nThey were in their shirt-sleeves and there was much display of belt and of \nunbuttoned neck. \nTheir helmets were apt to be stuck on their heads in informal attitudes. They \nwere inexpressibly untidy, and they made in their march a loose, shambling \nsuggestion of a procession. \nThere was only one man who kept in his conduct a sense of decorum, yet I \ncannot recall it with any fondness. He wore his uniform precisely about him, \nand though perspiration assailed his face as he worked on his maudlin task not \na drop of it ever touched his jacket. He would gaze at me levelly when I \nwatched him work. I fancied the flies flew thicker over whatever grave he \nworked upon. I asked the corporal for his name, and was told that that was \nPrivate Amherst. Fitting enough, I remarked, that he should be named for a \ndealer in smallpox when he himself seemed almost taken by fever. I regretted \nmy remark the following day, as he stood in his open grave, saluted me, and \ndied on the spot of typhoid.” \nWeird, right? That’s not in the original. Well, the first bit is, I think, but the bit \nabout the guy dying of fever while digging a grave, definitely not. So, I reckon it \nmust be a version with all the bits they cut out for publishing in the book or the \nBMJ. Still, not specifically supernatural, right? Well, later in the book there’s \n\nChapter Nineteen, “The Story of the Restless Man”. In the version I read \nbefore, it’s a nice little story about a soldier with a wounded leg who’s given a \nbed, but keeps giving up his bed for other soldiers he reckons need it more. \nBut it keeps damaging his leg more and in the end they have to fully order him \nto stay in the bed. It’s meant to illustrate the unselfishness of a soldier to his \ncomrades. Well, in this weird edition, it goes a bit differently. \n“Among the wounded who came down from Spion Kop was a private whom I \nrecognised, though I scarce can bring myself to believe it. Private Amherst, who \nwas two months buried in the grave he himself had dug, was carried in on a \nstretcher. The thigh-bone was broken and the fracture had been much \ndisturbed by the journey to the hospital. He did not respond to my questions \nabout his supposed death, save a sly smile, and he was given a bedstead in one \nof the marquees. The limb was adjusted temporarily, and he was told to keep \nvery quiet and not to move off his back. Next morning, however, he was found \nlying upon his face, with his limb out of position and his splints, as he said, \nstaring me again in the eye, ‘all anyhow.’ I asked him why he had moved. He \ntold me, with flies buzzing around his fevered head, ‘You see, doctor, I am such \na restless man.’ \nThe limb was more elaborately adjusted and everything was left in excellent \nposition. Next morning, however, the restless man was found lying upon the \nfloor of the marquee, and in his bed was a man who had been shot through the \nchest. The marquee was crowded and the number of beds were few; those who \ncould not be accommodated on beds had to lie on stretchers on the ground. \nThe man who was shot in the chest had come in during the night, and had been \nplaced on the only available stretcher.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 2, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 4318}}
