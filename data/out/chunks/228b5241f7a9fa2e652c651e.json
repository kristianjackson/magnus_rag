The bloody crew of the Nemesis watched, \ntheir eyes riveted and their feet tapping to the music. Leonard’s rampage \nagainst the now unrecognisable corpse of Milton only ended when another \nsoldier, whose name I never knew, leapt forward with that same cry of \nviolence, and began to stab him wildly with a stolen bayonet. \nAs so it continued. Hour upon hour of that night, as one by one the stolen \nprisoners succumbed to that music, their silent, frozen terror giving way in a \nmoment to the eager desire to kill. The crew, hungry for death in their stolen \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 137 – Nemesis \n \n8 \n \nuniforms, at first cried out in joy with each new murder. Then they cried out \nwith expectation, and at last with what sounded like concern, casting their \neyes up into the empty sky as though waiting for something. As fewer and \nfewer of us remained, I could feel something like panic begin to spread \nthrough them, and I began to see the waterline creeping higher and higher up \nthe side of the ship, reaching eagerly to pull the Nemesis back down into its \ngrave. \nThe whole time, I expected the music to reach me, to take me, to seize my \nheart with murderous purpose, but it never did. Even as the last of the other \nprisoners began to hack wildly at each other, and the waters started to flow \nover the sides and around my ankles, I never felt it. Instead I broke and ran, \nfleeing for one of the smaller boats that had ferried us from the shore. The \ncrew did not stop me. They simply watched me with expressions of despair, of \nthe deepest disappointment I’ve ever seen. The small craft was iron, like the \nlarger vessel, and as it sunk finally beneath the waves again, I cut the \nremaining ropes and simply floated away. \nI was terrified I’d be picked up by the Japanese, or die out there in the ocean, \nbut as it was I got lucky, and then a few days later was picked up by an Allied \nship. I told them my story, just like I’m telling you know, and what do you \nknow? I got to sit out the rest of the war. \nI often think about that night. And it’s not the blood I remember, not the black \niron ship or the look on Leonard Holden’s face as he pulled poor Milton apart. \nIt’s the sadness on the faces of those who kidnapped us, those who made us \ndance to their violence. I don’t think I’ll ever know what they expected to \nhappen, but I think I’m very glad it didn’t. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 137 – Nemesis \n \n9 \n \nGERTRUDE \nFinal comments: Well, that’s quite a relief. Nearly forty years I’ve been \nwondering about The Slaughter’s ritual, keeping an eye out for anything that \nmight be stirring, and it turns out I needn’t have been worried at all. The Risen \nWar failed a few years before I was even born. I should have known, I suppose. \nFew wars in my lifetime have reached anywhere the near the heights of fear I \nsuspect this ritual would need, though I did spend some time a while back \nlooking over some details from the Cuban Missile Crisis to no avail. And all this \ntime the answer was just sitting in the archives at the Songling Centre. Funny \nhow that works, sometimes. \nAn interesting set of trappings for this one, the Opium War history of the \nNemesis, uniforms linking no doubt to horrific crimes from every imperial \nnation, all placed in the bloody heart of the Pacific theatre. And Japanese \nPOWs... \nSomething to do with attitude towards surrender and atrocity in Japan at the \ntime? The Senjinkun military code? Not my place to speculate, I suppose. Still, \nthe anti-climax is fascinating. I can only assume they were supposed to be \nbombed at the height of the ritual. Maybe by Japanese aircraft, maybe Allied, \nmaybe both. I wonder what stopped it? A Japanese radar filled with \nspiderwebs? A US destroyer finding itself suddenly alone in the open ocean? \nHeh. We’ll probably never know. \nHeh! I suppose... Ahh, if any of them survived the re-sinking of the Nemesis... \nGod, they must have been kicking themselves in 1945. If they’d just had a bit \nmore patience, waited a few years, sailed her into Nagasaki harbour instead... \nStill, none us can tell the future, can we?", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 4, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 4250}}
