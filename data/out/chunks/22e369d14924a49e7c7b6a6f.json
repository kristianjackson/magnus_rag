He didn’t tell me \nthe name of the tenant, though obviously I now know who it was. He didn’t \ngive me any real details on the phone, but he seemed happy to pay the \nemergency call-out charge, so I bundled up my wasp gear and headed out to \nProspero Road. \nIt was a bit strange to get a call about wasps at that time of year. It was late \nFebruary or early March, I think, and still quite cold. Still, if it was a warm \nenough building, they could easily be getting active. Regardless, I made sure to \ncheck over the thick suit I used for that sort of job, to make sure there was no \nweakness or damage. If they were aggressive enough to injure someone, I \nwasn’t going to take any chances. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 055 – Pest Control \n \n12 \n \nThe landlord’s name was Arthur Nolan. He was a short man with a constant \nscowl, thinning white hair and a well-chewed cigar. It looked like his denim \nshirt had once contained quite an athletic build, but it had long since settled. \nHe looked me up and down as I left my van and I saw his mouth twist briefly in \nirritation. Clearly, he wasn’t impressed. I gave him the usual talk through, what \nwas going to happen, and he nodded absently before pressing the keys to flat 4 \ninto my hands and pointing me towards it. If I needed anything, he said, he’d \nbe in flat 1, where he lived. I advised him and the other tenants to stay out of \nthe building while I was dealing with the wasps, but he just grunted and told \nme again that he’d be in flat 1. The other tenants had apparently already left. I \nloaded up on Ficam D insecticide and headed in. \nIt was a lot quieter than I expected. By the time I was outside flat 4, I would \nnormally have expected to be hearing the buzzing sound of wasps, but the \nevening was quiet. I opened the door slowly – no sudden movements that \nmight alarm anything on the other side, but again the flat seemed to be empty. \nIt looked like there’d been some chaos though, with books and clothes strewn \nacross the floor and a shattered TV screen in the corner. I found the ladder up \ninto the loft space in the centre of the bedroom. It was quite small and \nclimbing it in my bulky suit was tricky, but I got up there. Still no wasps, but it \nwas very dark, so I rooted around again until I found the switch to a single bare \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 055 – Pest Control \n \n13 \n \nbulb. The light was very faint, but enough to make out a thick, pulpy lump up \nagainst the far wall. \nIt certainly didn’t look like any wasps’ nest I’d seen before. I mean, the shape \nwas familiar enough, but the texture of the surface was way off. It seemed a \nlot less papery than would have been normal, and the whorls were less \nregular, going off at odd angles and making it kind of hard to look away. The \nwhole thing was spongy, pocked with tiny holes, and generally looking very \nunhealthy indeed. And most disconcerting of all, there were still no wasps. \nNone of this changed the job I had to do, so I figured I’d start off like any other \nwasps’ nest and see if it worked. I reached forward, staying as far from this \nthing as the nozzle would let me, and I pushed it into one of the larger holes. It \nsank in with almost no resistance at all. I took a deep breath and pulled the \ntrigger, spraying the insecticide dust deep into the mass. \nThe effect was immediate. The whole thing started to pulse and spasm, the \nspongy flesh of it throbbing and bubbling like some sort of vile putty. It began \nto grow in size, blossoming out and covering the rest of the nozzle, reaching \nout for me. And then it began to scream. Not the sound of air escaping or a \nbuzzing that sounded like screaming, the weird nest thing was letting out a", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 4, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 3716}}
