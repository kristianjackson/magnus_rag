A decidedly tame result for a run-in with Gregor \nOrsinov’s troupe, especially as this would have been during the height of their \ntour. If it was in the 70s, after Denikin had left, then maybe it would come as \nless of a surprise, but as it stands, I think it somewhat amazing that the whole \ntown appears to have made it through in one piece. Obviously, it’s a good \nthing the children survived, but it does pique my interest in Ivan Utkin. \nUnfortunately, he appears to have passed away in 1984, but he must have \nbeen something rather special. \n[Tape clicks off. Tape clicks on.] \nARCHIVIST \nSupplemental. This is the first of the tapes I have received from Basira. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG044 – Tightrope \n10 \n \nLuckily it appears that Gertrude was not as lax in properly marking these tapes \nas she has been the rest of the archive. While it provides some interesting \ncontext for Leanne Denikin’s statement, and this strange circus, I will admit to \nsome disappointment it doesn’t address any of my more pressing questions \nabout Gertrude’s tapes. \nWhy did she begin recording them? And why stop? If she’d been doing so right \nup until her death, she would’ve likely gotten through much of the archive, \nand… moreover I wouldn’t have had to find this tape player tucked away in the \nstorage room, covered in dust and cobwebs. \nMoreover, she clearly knows a lot more about what is going on than I had \npreviously assumed. This is far from the first time she has encountered ‘The \nOther Circus’, or ‘The Circus of the Other’, or however it translates. I suppose \nI’ll have to return the tape to Basira, and wait until she can get me another \none. It is infuriating to have to simply… wait like this, but there is little else I \ncan do. \nAdditionally, I think someone may have found these… secret tapes. They do \nnot appear to have been disturbed, but the drawer in which I kept them is \nslightly more open than I left it. I have not mentioned it to the others, as if any \nof them did open my drawer for innocent reasons, then I don’t want to let \nthem know there is anything significant about the tapes inside. I have prised up \none of the floorboards, and will be hiding them beneath there from now on. \nEnd supplement. \n[Tape clicks off.] \n[The Magnus Archives Theme - Outro] \n \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG044 – Tightrope \n11 \n \nThe Magnus Archives is a podcast distributed by Rusty Quill and licensed under \na creative commons attribution, non-commercial share alike 4.0 international \nlicense.
