I did \ntell her that I was a doctor, and specifically visiting in order to help end any \nindisposition, but she just shook her head and told me he’d see me when he \nwas ready. \nThe house seemed so empty. The rain battered on the window and the clocks \nticked away in every room, but there seemed no sound of life to be found \nanywhere. As I sat in the drawing room, I realised Greta had left the door \nbehind me open to the corridor beyond. I tried to ignore it, simply drink my \nbrandy and continue waiting, but I could not ignore the sensation that \nsomeone was out there, watching behind me. The corridor was dark and I \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 127 – Remains to be Seen \n \n4 \n \nthought for a second I could make out a shape crouched there. But there was \nnothing, so I closed the door. \nEventually evening came and Greta informed me that dinner was served. I ate \nalone, sat in a long dining hall that seemed to have far too many windows. \nTurning behind me, I saw Greta watching me from the doorway. Her face held \nnothing of malice in it that I could discern, but still I was uneasy. I called, tried \nto dismiss her, but she didn’t seem to hear me. I retired back to the drawing \nroom to smoke my pipe, but even that simple, reassuring action brought me \nno comfort, and I made my way to the room I had been given without ever \nonce having seen my elusive host. I noted that the window looking over my \nbed had neither blind nor shutter, and I was all at once very aware of my \ncandle and the sickly illumination it spread over everything, the point of light \nreflected back in the glass like the glint of an eye. \nI did not sleep well that night. The feeling of being under observation did not \nlessen, and I remained unsure of the exact nature of this errand, an errand I \nremind you, Jonah, I undertook at your insistence. Eventually a fitful sleep \nfound me, and I had some measure of peace. \nIt was still dark when I awoke, and that feeling had intensified to a terrifying \nmeasure. I was now certain that something was in the room with me, staring at \nme. I reached over and took a match, striking it against the bedpost. And there, \nlooming over me, was a face, pale and shaking. The eyes were sunken, and the \ncheeks were dirty and unshaved. It was the face of Albrecht von Closen. In the \nlight his eyes met mine and his mouth began to work furiously, repeating the \nsame phrase over and over, increasing in volume until he was screaming it into \nmy face. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 127 – Remains to be Seen \n \n5 \n \n“Leg sie alle zurück! Leg sie alle zurück!” ‘Put them back. Put them back.’ \nI felt a sharp pain in my fingers as the match burned down and I dropped it \nwith a cry. The room disappeared into darkness once again, and when my \nscrabbling hands had gotten another lit, he was gone, and I was alone. I did not \nsleep any further that night. \nWhen the sun finally crept through my uncovered window, I dressed quickly. \nGreta’s pleas that I come down for breakfast were roundly ignored, and I \nstarted throwing open any door I had not yet seen behind, looking for my host. \nI found him in the library, where a fire already blazed in a feeble attempt to \nkeep the morning chill at bay. He stood in front of it, eyes lost in the flames, \nlooking every bit as feeble and worn as he had when crouched above my bed \nthe night before. \nI shut the door behind me, before Greta could object, and demanded to know \nwhy he had come into my room. He apologised in such a pitiful tone that the \nanger seemed to abandon me all at once. He seemed so small. He gestured for \nme to take a seat and I did, as he walked the shelves, stroking the spines of \neach book in turn. I started to ask him about his health and explained why I \nwas there, but he showed not the slightest sign that he was listening. \n“I had them rebound last year,” he said. “Damp can do terrible things to a \nbook.” \nI told him I was certain that was the case, but I must insist we talk about his \nhealth. Again, he ignored me. Instead, he took the seat opposite me and \nstarted to tell me a story. And then another. And another. A stream of strange \ntales began to pour out of him, and I just sat there, transfixed, desperately \nwishing I had the strength of will to stand and leave, but all I could do was", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 1, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 4403}}
