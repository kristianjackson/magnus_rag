It had an engraving of a cross on it, \nand the weighty lump of stone now lay embedded in the graveyard soil. I bent \ndown to lift it, but as I did so I saw something that froze me in place. The grave \nwas open. And it was empty. \nIt wasn’t dug up, exactly. The hole was neat, square and deep, as though ready \nfor a burial. At the bottom there was a coffin. It was open, and there was \nnothing inside. I backed away, and almost fell into another open grave behind \nme. I started to look around the cemetery with increasing panic. Every grave \nwas open and they were all empty. Even here among the dead, I was alone. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG013 – Alone \n12 \n \nAs I stared, the fog began to weigh me down. It coiled about me, its formless \ndamp clung to me and began to drag pull me gently, slowly, towards the \nwaiting pit. I tried to back away, but the ground was slick with dew and I fell. \nMy fingers dug into the soft cemetery dirt as I looked around desperately for \nanything I could use to save myself, and my hand closed upon that heavy piece \nof headstone. It took all my self-control to keep a grip on that anchor, as I \nslowly dragged myself away from the edge of my lonely grave. Flowing around \nme, the very air itself willed me inside, but I struggled to my feet. The image of \nEvan’s family suddenly came into my mind, and I vowed to myself that they \nwould not be the last human contact I ever had. \nI looked towards the chapel, and saw with a start that the door was now open, \nthe heavy chain discarded on steps in front. I ran to it as quickly as I could, \ncrying out for help, but when I reached the threshold I stopped, and could only \nstare in horror. Through that door, where the inside of the chapel should be, \nwas a field. It was bathed in sickly moonlight, and the fog rolled close to the \nground. It seemed to stretch for miles, and I knew that I could wander there \nfor years, and never meet another. I turned away from that door, but as I \nlooked behind me I could have wept – beyond the graveyard’s edge lay that \nsame field. Stretching off into the distance. \nI had to make a choice, and so I began to run from that chapel, into the field \nbehind me. I nearly fell into a hungry grave but kept my balance well enough to \nget beyond them. The fog seemed to be getting thicker, and moving through it \nwas getting harder. It was like I was running against the wind, except the air \nwas completely still. I could hardly breathe as I inhaled it. And then, as I found \nmyself in the middle of that open, desolate field, I heard something. It was the \nstrangest thing, but as I tried to run I could have sworn I heard Evan’s voice call \nto me. He said, “Turn left”. That’s it. That’s all he said. I know it sounds \nridiculous, but that’s what he told me to do. And I did it. I turned sharply to the \nleft and kept on running. And then... nothing. \nJONATHAN SIMS \nThat’s when the car hit you? \n \nNAOMI \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG013 – Alone \n13 \n \nYes. I remember a second of headlights and then nothing until I woke up in the \nhospital. \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nI see. \n \nNAOMI \nSo what do you think? Was it real? \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nWell, we’ll need to do some investigation into a few of the details that you \nraised, but at first impressions I’d say it was only real insofar as trauma can \nhave a very real effect on the mind. Beyond that, it’s difficult to prove either \nway, but I would suggest you leave the stone with us, so we can study it. And it \nwould likely help you move past this unpleasant incident. Some time with a \nmore… qualified care professional might also prove helpful. \nNAOMI Right. I don’t know what I expected, really. \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nWe’ll let you know if we find anything. \n \nNAOMI \nOh, this is ridiculous! I can’t believe I’ve wasted my time. \nJONATHAN SIMS \nStatement ends. \nFollowing Ms. Herne’s statement, we did as much follow-up as we were able, \nwhich admittedly wasn’t a lot.
