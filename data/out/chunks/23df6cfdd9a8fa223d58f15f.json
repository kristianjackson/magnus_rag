Maybe that's it. Maybe I have to feel this horrid \naching panic of the eyes I know are following me for seven years before they \nfinally leave. I hope not, but maybe even that's wishful thinking. Maybe this is \nnow my life forever and it will never, ever stop. I've tried to think whether I'd \nbe able to go on if that was the case. I think I'd try, at least until my parents \npassed away. I couldn't stand for them to lose both children. \nObviously, that was when my real problems began. I could write the face off as \na brief but horrid hallucination, but the feeling of being under constant \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 060 – Observer Effect \n \n8 \n \nscrutiny and observation isn't something I can explain away so easily. I've \nconsidered the possibility that I'm just going insane. Being watched is not an \nuncommon symptom of psychosis or schizophrenia and I've been keeping an \neye out for the other symptoms, but in all other ways I feel fine. It's true I'm \nfinding it hard to concentrate, but that's only because I can't sleep because \nthey're watching me, those unseen eyes that hover everywhere and won't let \nme rest. I'm, I'm not mad. I'm sure I'm not mad. \nI still have what's left of the mirror. It's just a bent gold frame now. I tried to \nhave new glass put in, but the only eyes it showed were mine. I did talk to \nAngus though. He seemed a little bit unnerved by the line of questioning I was \npursuing, or maybe just by how intensely I was asking the questions, but he \nanswered me. He didn't recognise the mirror, but a few years ago Christopher \nwas looking into writing a book on the totems of what he called 'outer cults', \nsmall, organised groups of worshippers whose beliefs weren't simply \ndeviations from paganism or other major religions, but seemed to focus on \nholy beings or concepts completely apart from what would be considered \nnormal religious practise. Some seemed to have more in common with ancient \nshamanism than with organised hierarchical worship and all were highly \nsecretive. \n \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 060 – Observer Effect \n \n9 \n \nChristopher had apparently collected several artefacts considered holy by \ncertain of these sects, though I could find no details among his documents. \nAngus couldn't be sure, but he believed that the mirror might have been one \nsuch object. Christopher had apparently abandoned the project about a year \nbefore his death, choosing instead to pursue a line of research into Inuit \nceremonial carvings. \nAnd here's where we finally come to why I'm here, because Angus told me that \nmy brother wasn't researching alone. He had apparently logged several trips to \nLondon in order to consult with your Institute. I don't know why or what about \nand no one here seems to be able or willing to help me find out, but he was \nhere. I'm not going to rest until I find out why. Not that I could rest anyway. \nThose eyes still haunt my dreams and follow me through the waking world. \nEven here. Especially here. \nARCHIVIST \nStatement ends. \nA bit of an odd one, this. The mid-late 20th century seems marginally better \nfiled than most of the archives, so we haven't seen as many rogue statements \ncropping up from that period.
