The feeling that \nsomething, somewhere, is letting you suffer, just so it can watch. \nARCHIVIST \nIs… is that me? Is… is that what I do? \nGERARD \nYou’re the Archivist, you tell me. \nARCHIVIST \nAh… Ah. The Spiral is the fear of madness, right? That worry that your world \nisn’t right, th-that your mind is lying to you? \nGERARD \nYeah, pretty much. \nARCHIVIST \nAnd The End is fear of death. \nGERARD \nSimple, but always there \nARCHIVIST \nThe Stranger is the, the unknown. The uncanny. \nGERARD \nThat kind of creeping sense that something’s not right. That guy you saw that \nmight be following you, might mean you harm. \nARCHIVIST \nIsolation. \nGERARD \n\nSmirke called it The Lonely. The feeling that you’re just... alone. Maybe there’s \nno-one else there at all, maybe you just can’t connect. \nARCHIVIST \nThen there’s… burning, the, uh, the Lightless Flame. \nGERARD \nThe Desolation. Fear of pain, fear of loss, fear of unthinking or cruel \ndestruction. \nARCHIVIST \nDoes it… watch over, um, war as, as well? Or is, is that The End? \nGERARD \nI mean, I think they both get a lot out of war, but you’re thinking of The \nSlaughter. It’s not cruel, exactly, or unstoppably like The End. It’s just pure \nviolence, not targeted or premeditated, just… unpredictable violence. And you \ndon’t know when, or even if it’s coming. Sometimes it’s aggressive, like a \nfrenzied killer, but sometimes it’s calm, like an army firing shells into a village. \nThe Slaughter’s not that common in peace but, well, you know, there’s always \na war somewhere. \nARCHIVIST \nRight. And, and then th-there’s, uh... Vertigo. The fear of, the fear of falling. \nGERARD \nThe Vast. Vertigo, agoraphobia, the dread of deep water, of our own \ninsignificance before the universe. \nARCHIVIST \nAnd on the other side, claustrophobia? \nGERARD \n\nThe Buried. Small spaces, crushing, you can’t breath. You’re at the centre of \neverything, and it all pushes down on you. If the Vast is like losing yourself in \ntoo much space, the Buried is being trapped without enough. \nARCHIVIST \nDarkness? \nGERARD \nThe Dark, yeah. That’s an old one, and one of the deepest. I mean, who isn’t a \nlittle bit afraid of the dark? Of what might be in it? \nARCHIVIST \nYeah. And there, um... I think Filth, it’s, it’s disease, but also insects? \nGERARD \nThe Corruption. Ooh, it’s a nasty one, that one. Just... disgust. Rot, decay, \ninfection. That feeling of your skin crawling or itching, being touched by \nsomething that might burrow inside you. \nSwarming and hollowing you out. Leaving you full of holes. \nARCHIVIST \nYeah. Not spiders, though? \nGERARD \nNo. They belong to The Web. \nARCHIVIST \nWhich is… spiders a-and control. Your, your will not being your own. \nGERARD \nYeah. Being manipulated or puppeted. The worry you’re caught in a trap you \ncan’t see. \nARCHIVIST \n\nYes. What about meat? How does that work? \nGERARD \nAh, The Flesh? \nARCHIVIST \nYeah, I-I mean, are we really so afraid of being… eaten? Of our bodies being all \ntwisted up, i-i-is that... I mean, some people sure, but… how is it one of the \nfourteen great fears? \nGERARD \nWhat? You think people are so special it’s only our fear that counts? \nARCHIVIST \nWh— No... \nGERARD \nEverything feels afraid sometimes. Sure, maybe it’s not as complicated or... \nexistential as our fear, but it’s real. And there’s, what, twenty billion chickens \nin the world? A few billion pigs, cows... How many of them are dying of old \nage? All that terror, it has to go somewhere. So it does. \nARCHIVIST \nAnd when something formed out of an animalistic fear of the slaughterhouse \nreaches out to, to people... \nGERARD \nThings get weird. Yeah. It gets mixed all up with human neuroses: bodies, gore, \ny’know, that nagging worry that deep down we’re just electrified meat \nsqueezing air at each other. \nARCHIVIST \nGood lord. \nGERARD", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 6, "chunk_count": 9, "chars": 3860}}
