But you have \nneed of neither, and so you sit in your meagre comfort and belief of security \nwith nothing to do, nothing to distract your mind from the agonies that lie just \nbeyond your window. And those diversions you do find will offer no relief, but \nsimply numb the mind into mournful nostalgia for a time when the world you \ninhabited seemed to make sense. \n[The howls from a creature outside seems closer for a moment] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nSomething moves outside, struggling to crawl upon a hundred reaching, \ngrasping hands. It shudders, and grips the earth, pulling itself along as nails rip \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 162 – A Cosy Cabin \n28 \nfree and skin scrapes loose. It is afraid of what it has become and where it \nmight be going. \nClose your eyes. Ignore the sounds. You, at least, are safe. \nThere, within the thing that pretends to be a cabin, is the one you love. You \nhold each other whisper words of reassurance, but the place knows this \ncomfort to be a lie, and laces upon it instead the awful fear of losing what you \nhave. Of it being stripped away by the chaos that waits for you beyond the \nwalls. Hold each other, it croons. Be happy. But know always that this \nhappiness is a lie, built on the squirming bones of those whose suffering you \nhave caused. It will not let you feel the warmth and joy that this love may claim \nto gift. It is only a mouldy treasure to be clung to. Something to fear the loss of \nas you hold it so tight that it withers and warps. It is a rotten sanctuary of \nlonely companionship. \nOutside it is raining. Heavy drops fall, ice-cold and laced with salt. Tears of \nvoyeuristic delight from the eyes that see and drink in all. It sinks, into the dry, \ncracked ground, and from the mud faces struggle to push themselves free and \nbreathe. They cannot reach the surface, as the slick soil flows down their \nthroats. Look closer at the rough planks that make this cabin, and see that they \nare warmer, softer and more yielding than the hard timber they present. Are \nthe dimensions of this place quite what they were when you stayed here \nbefore the change? Or are the walls thicker, the doors heavier when they \nclose? Were the curtains always stained that dull maroon? Or has the dust of \nthe horrific world they keep at bay dyed them so. The one you love is always \nnear, so close that refuge sometimes feels a prison. And yet your voice does \nnot echo when you call to them. And they find they sometimes cannot hear it. \nStay, the cabin says. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 162 – A Cosy Cabin \n29 \n[A clap of thunder] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nStay within my false defences, cling so close to what you desperately wish to \nsave, and live in shaking fear of the things beyond that may take it from you. \nThrow another log on the fire and curl up close. There are always more logs for \nthe fire here. This is your home, and here you can be safe, as you putrefy, body \nand soul. This place wishes to be our tomb. But the Eye does not wish that. \nNo, the Eye wishes instead that it be my chrysalis. \n[Hissing static begins] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \n It is time that I emerge. \nARCHIVIST \nAh-ah! \n[The Archivist staggers, knocking against items] \n[Martin enters] \nMARTIN \nJohn? Is it— I thought I heard— are you, are you okay? \nARCHIVIST \nI,ye- yes, I (sigh) I think so. \nMARTIN \nWhat happened? The tapes, were yo— \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 162 – A Cosy Cabin \n30 \n[Hissing static ends] \nARCHIVIST \nI, I was listening, and, i-it, it was the one with Tim and, and Sasha, uh, where \nthey’re— \nMARTIN \nYeah, y-yeah. (soft) Yeah. Look, John, I-I know it hurts, but you’ve just got to— \nARCHIVIST \nNo, no— O,Oka— I, I was listening, and I, I was filled with this... hatred. This \nanger; I, I wanted to leave and hunt down Elias, uh, and— \nMARTIN \nUh- w,wow, okay. \nARCHIVIST \nBut when I thought it, th-there was, there was something else. \n[The safehouse creaks] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nTh-This place, it- it didn’t want me — it didn’t want us — to go. \nMARTIN \nWhat do you mean?", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 5, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 4112}}
