You ask me to take a tape over to this murdering freak, and I’m all set to \ntear you a new one for it. But then I get the cassette in my hand, and suddenly \nall I want to do is deliver his tapes, and spill my guts. \nBASIRA \nSo, so now you kill him? \nDAISY \nFirst him, then his creepy boss. \nBASIRA \nThis is too far, Daisy. You know it is. \nDAISY \nHe murdered two people, Basira. Maybe more. I’ve done one monster today, \nno reason not to do another. \nARCHIVIST \nI didn’t… I didn’t kill anyone! \nBASIRA \nFor god’s sake look at him! \nDAISY \nThen who? \nARCHIVIST \nI thi- I thi- I think it was Elias. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG091 – The Coming Storm \n15 \n \nDAISY \nYeah. Well he’s on my list too. \nBASIRA \nWhat if he asks? \nDAISY \nWhat? \nBASIRA \nYou reckon he can mind control people. Make them tell the truth? Why not try \nit on Elias? \nDAISY \nHe’s got, he’s got his own… He knows things. Would that work? \nARCHIVIST \nI don’t know. I, I could try. \nBASIRA \nDaisy! This might be our only chance to find out what’s going on. \nDAISY \nAlright. But if this doesn’t work, you’re still dead. \nARCHIVIST \nYeah. Yeah. What about Mike? \nDAISY \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG091 – The Coming Storm \n16 \n \nWho? Oh.
