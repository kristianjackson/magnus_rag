He was short, barely over \nfive feet, and very thin, underfed, I remember thinking. It hadn’t yet turned \ncold, but he wore a high collared coat and a thick scarf wrapped around his \nneck. \nNow I’m getting on in years and, much as I love my shop, the building can get a \nbit drafty come autumn, so I generally have the heating up quite high. It was \nclearly enough for him to become uncomfortable wrapped up like that and he \nremoved the scarf to reveal a branching pattern of white scar tissue arcing up \nthe side of his neck. That was interesting, certainly, but it wasn’t what actually \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG046 – Literary Heights \n3 \n \ncaught my eye. No, what struck me most was that rather than wonder or \ncuriosity, as I would see in the faces of the other students who found their way \ninto Lion Street Books, this young man began scanning the shelves with an \nexpression that seemed more like impatience. \nHe was clearly looking for something specific, so after a few minutes I asked \nhim if I could help. Without looking up, he said he was after a copy of de \nPlancy’s Dictionnaire Infernal, the older the better. I only had a 1908 \ntranslation in stock, but I said I would make enquiries if he wished for an older \nedition. He didn’t reply to this, nor to my casual enquiry as to whether he was \nstudying demonology or the occult. He took it to my desk to buy it and I \nstarted rooting around for the credit card machine, when I smelt the strangest \nthing. \nIt was like just before a storm breaks, that sharp smell in the air, but looking \noutside the sky was clear and the sun was shining. Mike seemed to smell it too \nand he went very still. He reached into his jacket and pulled out a wad of cash. \nHe quickly counted it out, grabbed the book and was through the door before I \neven had a chance to ring him up a receipt. The smell faded as soon as he was \nout of sight. \nI didn’t know his name at that point, but it was far from the last time I saw him. \nHe became something of a regular. Maybe once every three weeks or so he’d \ncome in and check any new stock I had. He was interested in spiritualism, \nhistory of witchcraft, anything mystical, especially from before 1850. He also \nbought a few books on meteorology, especially pre-enlightenment, and once a \nbook on the work of Gottfried Leibniz, though I don’t remember the title. \nI have no idea where he was getting his money, but he had a lot of it. He was \nable to pay five figures for a copy of a 1559 printing of the Malleus \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG046 – Literary Heights \n4 \n \nMaleficarum without breaking a sweat. At some point I learned his name. I \nmean, I certainly wouldn’t have described him as a friend or even close, but \nover the last year he’d easily been my most regular customer. That wasn’t the \nonly time I smelled that acrid tang in the air though. Sometimes when he was \nin there it would come again all at once. It never seemed to be coming from \nMike exactly, but when he was around the smell would just suddenly be there. \nIt was the only time I would ever smell it inside and, when I did, Mike would \njust stop whatever he was doing and leave immediately. He wouldn’t run; he’d \njust leave. \nThere was another thing too. Whenever he was in, the light bulbs in my shop \nwould burn brighter. I didn’t even realise this until he had been coming for \nseveral months, as it was usually in daylight when he went shopping. But when \nwinter made its presence known, his late afternoon visits began to take place \nafter dark and I noticed that, whenever he came in, the shop got brighter. The \nbulbs would start to buzz very softly and the elements within them would glow \nwith a surprising intensity. There was this strange electric crackling and once I \neven got a shock when I turned a lamp on. I never brought it up with Mike \nthough. I don’t even know how I would have gone about bringing it up. \nIt was February when I got the Leitner book. I’d heard of him before, of course, \nthough I’d never met the man. The rare book trade is a comparatively small \nworld, at least within the UK, and his name would often come up whenever I \nwas gossiping with my peers. Sometimes it was about which valuable piece \nhe’d snatched for a fraction of its true value, or the ridiculous amounts he’d \npaid for a book that everyone else was sure was a fake. Occasionally there \nwere more unsavoury rumours", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 1, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 4499}}
