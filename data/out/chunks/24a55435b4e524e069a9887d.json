His name was Carl. We weren’t close. I saw him plenty \ngrowing up – his family lived in Peterborough and mine lived in Leicester, so it \nwasn’t too far. We’d go over occasionally, or we’d all be left together at our \ngrandmothers if our parents were doing something together. They never came \nover to our house, though; at least I don’t remember them doing so. My \nmemories of childhood are a bit hazy, so I can’t be completely sure. Putting it \ndown on paper now, though, I realise that, given how close we lived, it’s odd \nthat we didn’t see each other more. I wonder how well our parents really got \non. Thinking about it, I suppose they never had much in common. \nEither way we got on fine, me and Carl. I think. I was a few years younger than \nhim, and when you’re a kid that makes a lot of difference. I suspect he saw me \nas a bit of an annoyance, a bit of a tag-along, but I don’t remember us ever \ngetting into fights or anything like that. We’d spend most of the time exploring \nmy grandmother’s wide country garden, or sitting awkwardly together \npretending to do something while our parents talked about whatever grown-\nup topics needed their attention. \nSince I grew up and moved out, though, I hardly ever saw Carl. A family dinner \nat Christmas some years or the occasional big family birthday, but if you \ntotalled up all the hours we spent together since I turned eighteen, I doubt \nwe’d be very far into double digits. And if you only count the time we’d \nactually spent talking to each other… I’m not sure you could even piece \ntogether a full hour. \nIt didn’t really bother me, and it certainly didn’t bother him. I remember, \nshortly after I moved down to London I actually bumped into him shopping in \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG078 – Distant Cousin \n3 \n \nCovent Garden. Turned out he lived about twenty minutes bus ride from me. I \nhalf-heartedly suggested we should go for a drink or hang out or something. \nAnd he said, “Yeah”, in a flat tone that told me he had absolutely no interest \nwhatsoever in doing so. \nI wonder if I ever did anything as a child to set him against me? Or in that tiny \nsliver of time we actually interacted as adults. It’s weird to think about people \nwho knew you as a child. You change so much, and when you talk to them \nagain, they’re not talking to you. They’re talking to someone else, someone \nyou used to be. The person they think they’re seeing has been dead for years, \nbut they didn’t see the change. They’re looking at a complete stranger, and \nthey have no idea. \nI went to my brother’s wedding recently, and there was something pretending \nto be my cousin Carl. Adam, my brother, had always gotten along slightly \nbetter with him than I had, being closer in age, and during the ceremony I had \nbeen surprised not to see Carl among the guests. It was only later, at the \nreception, when I was being introduced to a number of my brother’s friends I’d \nnever met before, that I offered my hand to a dark-haired stranger and asked \nhis name. He looked at me for a long, off-putting second as a wide smile crept \nacross his face. “I know it’s been a long time, Lawrence,” he said, “but surely \nyou haven’t forgotten your cousin Carl?” \nWhat are you supposed to say to that? I just sort of stammered and wandered \noff. I didn’t realise exactly what was happening until I asked my brother who \nthe stranger was, and he gave me a puzzled look and told me, yes, that was \nCarl, my cousin. I assumed he must be playing some sort of joke, but the whole \nthing had really kind of unsettled me, so I asked my fathe", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 0, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 4500}}
