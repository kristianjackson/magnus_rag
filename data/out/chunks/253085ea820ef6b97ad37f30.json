A nonsense poem from 1922? \nNo, I am more interested, as before, with who is sending me these statements, \nand why this one, especially as the message, if indeed there is one, seems to \ncontradict the last one. If the… ‘moral’, shall we say, of Ms. Ashburt’s \nstatement was that ignoring the horrors stalking you just makes them more \ndangerous, then surely the message of this one is that confronting them \ndirectly is even more so. I suppose that leaves skulking around the periphery. \nWhich is what I was already doing! \nThere is, of course, a different reading, which is that this is a targeted warning \nabout trusting Michael, given the obvious parallels: swap out stairways for \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG085 – Upon the Stair \n8 \n \ncorridors and spirals for fractals, and there you go. The Nowhere Man thing is \nnew, though. What was it Leitner said about the Spiral? It deals with fooling \nyour senses, drawing your mind into difficult paths, making you doubt the \nreality you live in. \nWell, if this is a warning about Michael, then it is, as before, somewhat \nsuperfluous. If I never see him – if I never see it again, it’s too soon. \nMaybe that’s it. It. Maybe whoever sent this wants me to consider how many \nof these creatures used to be people. How many seem to have taken the \nmantle from the ones that came before them, and how none of them have \nbeen able to overcome their new natures. How most of them don’t even seem \nto think like people anymore. Given that there is every possibility I’ve taken \none of these mantles myself, this is not an interpretation I’m keen on. \nOr it could be someone in the Archives randomly sending me statements, with \nno curation, rhyme or reason. Assuming they come from the Archives. They’re \nmarked as Institute statements, but I have no idea who’s sending them. I feel \nlike I’ve been seeing a lot of police cars about, maybe… no, that’s absurd. \nMaybe Leitner stole a lot of statements and had a, a sort of dead man’s switch \nto… (Sighs) Occam’s Razor. For now, it makes sense to assume they’re coming \nfrom the Institute, and they’re only coming one at a time, so I will work on the \nbelief that they are some way curated. So the current questions are who and \nwhy. \nI feel bad staying put, like… like I might be placing Georgie in danger, but I \ndon’t have anywhere else to go at the moment, and if the increased police \npresence isn’t just in my head, then I don’t – \n[The door opens.] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG085 – Upon the Stair \n9 \n \nGEORGIE \nRight, I’m out tonight, ok? There should be some stuff in the freezer if you… \nOh. \nARCHIVIST \nI was just, uh… \nGEORGIE \nYou didn’t say we got another one. \nARCHIVIST \nI didn’t want to worry you. \nGEORGIE \nI knew it was something. You’ve been weird all day. \nARCHIVIST \nI’m sorry, I… I don’t know. \nGEORGIE \nYeah. Well, we can talk about it later. I need to head out. \nARCHIVIST \nYeah. Yeah, y… you look great. What’s the occasion? \nGEORGIE \nI have a date. \nARCHIVIST \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG085 – Upon the Stair \n10 \n \nOh. Oh! Do you need me to get out of the house for the night? \nGEORGIE \n(Laughs) Oh, no. Trust me, nothing’s happening tonight. \nARCHIVIST \nOh… How are you so sure? \nGEORGIE \nCheck out his profile. \nARCHIVIST \nGood lord. \nGEORGIE \nYeah. \nARCHIVIST \nI mean, he does know what a book is, right? \nGEORGIE \nUnclear. He climbs mountains, though. \nARCHIVIST \nYeah, I got that. “Face to face with your own mortality on the frozen peaks, \nstaring death in the face and saying ‘Not today, dude.’” The man’s a poet. \nAnd… why are you going out with him again? \nGEORGIE \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG085 – Upon the Stair \n11 \n \nHe, uh… he likes Hungarian food. And there’s place just opened. \nARCHIVIST \nYou’re serious? You’re going on a date with… the Dullard of Skull Mountain, \njust so you have an excuse to eat a shopska salad? \nGEORGIE \nI need my sheep’s cheese, John. No one else will go with me. You hate \nHungarian food. Jeff says it tastes too “Soviet”, apparently, whatever that \nmeans. Melanie says it’s too salty. Everyone I know has bad taste in food. \nARCHIVIST \nI don’t hate Hungari– Hold on. Melanie’s back? \nGEORGIE \nYou didn’t hear? \nARCHIVIST \nHear what? \nGEORGIE \nYeah, she… had a bad time in India. She got shot. \nARCHIVIST \nShe… what? \nGEORGIE \nYeah, I know.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 3, "chunk_count": 5, "chars": 4310}}
