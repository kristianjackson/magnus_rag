You came to us. \nBASIRA \nYeah... Just wanna talk about it with someone, you know? \nARCHIVIST \nVery much so. \nBASIRA \nI'm breaking the law by talking to you. You understand that? \nARCHIVIST \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG043 – Section 31 \n2 \n \nI… think so. Some sort of non-disclosure agreement, I believe? \nBASIRA \nPretty much. D-Do you need my real name? \nARCHIVIST \nTechnically no, but from what I understand of your situation, you'd be rather \nidentifiable even without it. This is not the first time we've had statements \nfrom witnesses in sensitive positions. \nI'll mark the tape and file it for internal use only, which means it comes under \nthe Institute's own, very strict, NDA policy and cannot be referenced or \nrequested by external agencies or authorities. \nSuch as the police. \nBASIRA \n[Pointedly] That's the best you can offer? \nARCHIVIST \nI'm afraid so, though I remind you again you are under no obligation to make a \nstatement if it makes you uncomfortable. Or, if you're worried about your \nvoice being recognised, you could always write it down. I'll make an audio \ncopy later. \nBASIRA \nI'm not really big on writing. I'm more of a talker. \nARCHIVIST \nOdd choice of career, then; [attempting levity] I hear there are lots of forms to \nfill in. \nBASIRA \nNot much since I became Section 31. \nARCHIVIST \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG043 – Section 31 \n3 \n \nYes, you mentioned. This Section Thirty– you know what, we will cover it in the \nstatement. \nStatement of Police Constable Basira Hussain regarding her time \ninvestigating… strange occurrences as part of Section 31. Statement taken \ndirect from subject, September 19th 2016. \nStatement begins. \nBASIRA \n… \nNow? \nARCHIVIST \nYes. \nBASIRA \nRight, well, first off, I'm not ‘part’ of Section 31. It's not like a unit or a division \nwithin the police force or anything like that. It's a form you have to sign. \nSection 31 of the Freedom of Information Act covers exclusions for \ninformation pertaining to law enforcement. It just means that any information \nthat could interfere with the prevention or detection of a crime can't be given \nout as part of an FOI request. So what happens is, when you stumble across \nsomething a bit... weird, then after it's over you're taken to one side, and told \nto sign a form officially declaring what you saw and experienced was directly \nrelated to a crime. Then it's covered by Section 31 and can't be revealed under \nthe Freedom of Information Act. There's a whole bunch of other NDA stuff in \nthere as well, but it basically means you have to keep quiet about it. \nThing is, signing your first Section 31 really marks you out. Word spreads fast in \na station, and once they see you’ve signed one, people start to push you in \nthat direction. They call you ‘sectioned’, which I guess is kind of appropriate? \nYou're generally assigned to head out with others who've signed, and if any", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 0, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 3465}}
