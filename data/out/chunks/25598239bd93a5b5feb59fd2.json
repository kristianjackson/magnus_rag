I didn’t watch a lot of television even before my living \nroom was taken over with storing this thing, and so I now found myself sat in \nmy room reading quite a lot. I remember I had just started Michael Crichton’s \nThe Lost World at the time, and it started raining outside. It was a hard, heavy \nrain, the sort that falls straight down with no wind to disturb it, until \neverything is dark and wet. It was barely past midday, but I remember the sky \nwas so overcast and gloomy that I had to get up to turn on the light. And that \nwas when I heard it. It was a low, gentle sound. I’ve seen Dawn of the Dead, I \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG002 – Do Not Open \n9 \n \nknow what the groans of the undead are meant to sound like, but it wasn’t \nthat at all. It was almost… melodious. It sounded almost like singing, if it was \nmuffled by twenty feet of hard-packed soil. At first I thought it might have \nbeen coming from one of the other flats in my building, but as it went on, and \nthe hairs on my arms began to stand on end I knew, I just knew, where it was \ncoming from. \nI walked to the living room and stood in the doorway, watching as the sealed \nwooden box continued to moan its soft, musical sound out at the rain. There \nwas nothing to be done, I’d made my decision not to open it, and this certainly \ndid not make me want to reconsider that. So I just went back to my bedroom, \nput on some music and turned it up loud enough to drown out the sounds. And \nso it continued for a few months. Whatever was in the casket would scratch at \nanything placed on top of it and moan whenever it rained, and that was that. I \nsuppose it goes to show that you can get used to anything if you have to, no \nmatter how bizarre. \nI occasionally considered trying to get rid of it, or finding people like you guys \nto investigate, but in the end I decided that I was actually more afraid of \nwhoever was responsible for entrusting me with the coffin than I was of the \nactual coffin itself. So I kept it secret. The only thing that worried me was \nsleeping. I think it gave me bad dreams. I don’t remember my dreams, never \nhave, and if I was getting nightmares, they were no different – I didn’t \nremember them and I certainly don’t now. But I know I kept waking up in a \npanic, clutching at my throat and struggling to breath. I also started \nsleepwalking. The first time that happened it was the cold that woke me up. It \nwas the middle of winter and I tend not to keep the heating on when I’m \nasleep. It took me a few seconds to fully process where I was. I was standing in \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG002 – Do Not Open \n10 \n \nthe dark, in my living room, over the coffin. What concerned me more about \nthe situation was the fact that, when I awoke, I seemed to be holding the key \nto it in my hand. Obviously this worried me. I even went to my GP about it, \nwho referred me to the sleep clinic at the nearby hospital, but the problems \nnever recurred in a clinical setting. I decided to hide the key in more and more \ndifficult to access places, but still I kept waking up with it, and I was starting to \npanic. \nWhen I awoke one morning to find I’d actually placed the key within the lock \nand was, as far as I could tell, moments from opening it, I knew I had to find a \nsolution. In the end what I took to doing was perhaps a bit elaborate, but it \nseemed to work: I would place the key within a bowl of water and then put it \nin the freezer, encasing it in a solid block of ice. I still sometimes found myself \ntrying to get to the key in my sleep, but the chill of the ice always woke me up \nlong before I could do anything with it. And in the end it just became yet \nanother part of my routine. I lived like that for almost a year and a half. It’s \nfunny how fear can just become as routine as hunger – at a certain point I just \naccepted it. \nMy first clue that my time keeping the coffin was coming to an end was when \nit began to rain and there was silence. I didn’t notice at first, as my habit at \nthat point had been to put on the music as soon as the weather began to turn, \nbut after a few minutes I realised that there wasn’t anything to drown out. I \nturned off my music and went to check. The living room was silent. Then came \na knock at the door. The sound was light and unobtrusive but it rang out like \nthunder in the quiet flat. I knew what I’d see as soon as I opened the door and I \nwas right. Jo", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 6, "chunk_count": 9, "chars": 4500}}
