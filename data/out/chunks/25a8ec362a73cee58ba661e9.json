If they had any. \nThere was no way to tell the time here. The window in his room grew bright \nand dark but the light was wrong for the sun. At some point he’d broken the \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 182 – Wellbeing \n13 \nglass in a desperate attempt to escape, but was confronted by a fluorescent \nlight installed in front of a brick wall. He had tried to count how long it was on \nfor and how long it was off, but it seemed almost random, and the pain grew \nworse when he tried to keep track of time. \nAt some point in each lighted time, they would come, unlocking the rusty iron \ndoor of his hospital room, and surrounding his bed three-deep. \n[Rusty door is opened and footstep file into the room; the heart \nrate monitor continues to slowly rise in tone and pace; the sound of \nlatex makes unpleasant squelching sounds] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nSome were tall and narrow, others wide or crooked. None of them were quite \nthe right proportions to be convincingly human. They mumbled among \nthemselves, meaninglessly saying words like ‘intubation’, ‘radiology’ or ‘stat’. \nOccasionally one of them would touch him, the strange texture of their bodies \nwas clear even through all the layers in which they hid. Eventually, one of \nthem, and it was always a different one, would push to the front. \n[A breathy, rattling alien sound] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \n‘I am the doctor’, it would say, ‘are you well?’ \nThis was it, the moment of truth, the point at which all Jeremy’s anxiety came \nto a head. They all leaned in, hidden faces focused on him, as though drinking \nin his desperation. He had to make an answer, a simple yes or no. He’d learned \nthe hard way that nuanced answers or stoic silence only made it worse. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 182 – Wellbeing \n14 \nSo he picked one. A roll of the dice. In many ways it didn’t matter which he \nchose, as there was no way to determine if the doctor of the day considered \nhis wellness an aim to be achieved or a condition that required curing. \n‘Yes,’ he might say. ‘I am well.’ And if he had chosen right, the mask would \nwiden as though the face behind it extended in a smile. \n[A breathy, rattling alien sound] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \n‘Wonderful!’ would come the response, ‘keep it up!’, and the crowd would file \nout and lock the door behind them, leaving Jeremy to wait for his next \nassessment. \nBut he rarely seemed to choose right. The rest of the time a shudder of \nanticipation would pass through the medical things around him. \n[A breathy, rattling alien sound] \n[The heart monitor’s tone and speed start rising at a faster pace] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \n ‘Well, let’s see what we can do about treating that,’ the doctor would say.
