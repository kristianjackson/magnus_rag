I can barely live, either. Food and drink \nmake me sick, and I cannot sleep. There is an aching inside of me. A craving for \nsomething, but I don’t know what. I don’t seem to age, but I’ve only been flesh \nagain for a few years, so can’t be sure of this. I have often wondered about \nwhether I’m the only one like me in the world. I can’t be. It doesn’t make \nsense. I know there were others. But I don’t know where. \nI can’t decide whether this existence I find myself in is better than the death I \nfeared so long ago. I sometimes wonder, but have decided that it is. A living \nhell is, after all, still living. \nJONATHAN SIMS \nStatement ends. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG029 – Cheating Death \n11 \n \nI’ve had the blood checked, and it appears to be real. O Negative. And that’s \nabout as far as I can confirm anything about this statement, forty-four years \nafter the fact. The details Mr Thorp provided on his residence, occupation, et \ncetera, appear to have been accurate for the time, but we’ve been unable to \ntrack down any up-to-date information on him, if he even still lives. \nFiona Law, the research assistant who took the statement, passed away in \n2003 from complications following a liver transplant, and with two exceptions \nno-one else working for the Institute at the time is still employed here. \nGertrude Robinson was there, of course, but we can’t exactly ask her, and Elias \nwas working as a filing clerk at the time. I followed up with him, and he does \nremember there being something of a commotion around that time about \nsomeone self-harming while giving a statement – rumours said they’d cut off \ntheir finger or something – but he wasn’t directly involved and didn’t know \nmuch more about it. \nAside from that it’s almost a complete dead end. The only other thing in the \nfile can’t really be considered a lead, especially as it’s now gone. It was a small, \nhexagonal token, about an inch in diameter. There were no markings on it, but \nit appeared to be made of very old bone. I was unable to determine anything \nfurther, as when I picked it up, it simply crumbled to dust in my hand. Perhaps \nthat’s fitting. \nRecording Ends. \n[The Magnus Archives Theme - Outro] \n \nThe Magnus Archives is a podcast distributed by Rusty Quill and licensed under \na creative commons attribution, non-commercial share alike 4.0 international \nlicense.
