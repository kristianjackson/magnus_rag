I was also given a very thorough dressing \ndown by my Bishop, who told me to take a step back and leave the exorcisms \nto Father Harrogate for some time. Annie almost got suspended over the \nmatter, but in the end was spared further disciplinary action, as she had been \nsimply passing on the wishes of the patient. \nAnd for a couple of years that was it. I felt a great deal of guilt over my \ninvolvement with Bethany’s death, and I started to drink more than I had \nbefore. I was never, I think, in danger of becoming an alcoholic, as most of the \npriests I worked with had done work with substance abusers – not to mention \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG019 – Confession \n8 \n \nthe fact that priests are certainly not immune to alcoholism – and would have \npicked up on the warning signs. But they did express concern over the \noccasional disappearance of bottles of sacramental wine. At the time I was \nsure it wasn’t me. I preferred scotch and the Muscatel wine they bought had \nnever really been to my taste, but looking back I can’t really be sure what I was \ndrinking. I know it’s something of a jump from unwittingly stealing holy wine to \nmy later crimes, but I’m trying my best to fit this into a relatively coherent \nnarrative. \nApart from that, the years passed uneventfully, and I was starting to feel like \nI’d put the whole affair behind me. Until I got a call from Annie. She said that a \ngentleman had been admitted to the John Radcliffe after having something of \na scare in a house up on Hill Top Road. I explained to her that I wasn’t \nperforming exorcisms at the moment, and said she should talk to Father \nHarrogate. She assured me it wouldn’t need a full exorcism, and if I did we \ncould bring him in, but she didn’t know or trust Father Harrogate, but just \nwanted my opinion. Finally, after a lot of pestering, I agreed to pay a visit to \nthe house. \nIt was late when I got there, and starting to get very cold. The whole affair was \nstarting to bring back some less than pleasant memories of my arrival at \nBullingdon Road all those years ago. I was also a bit annoyed at Annie for not \nmentioning that the house was still under construction, not only making it \nunlikely to be the haunt of demons or spirits, but also meaning that the coat I \nhad brought along would be somewhat inadequate against the chill in a house \nwithout windows. I knocked on the door and one of the builders opened it. I \nforget his name, I’m afraid, something Polish I think, or maybe Czech? He \nseemed confused at first as to why I was there, but I explained and it turned \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG019 – Confession \n9 \n \nout he was the one that had been treated by Annie at the hospital. She had not \nmentioned the builder’s possible schizophrenia to me, but I began to fear that \nthis may be a waste of time. Still, I had a look around and asked the builder \nquestions about the place. He certainly did have an interesting story, but I was \nunsure of how much of it I believed. \nEventually, I decided that I’d seen enough and that there didn’t seem to be any \nmalicious presence here. The builder was looking at me in such as way as to \nmake me hesitant to tell him that, so I decided I would at least give the place a \nquick prayer or blessing. I asked him to wait outside, though. Something in his \nmanner was a bit off-putting and I felt uncomfortable with him watching me \nlike a hawk, as though I were about to vanish at any moment. \nHe headed into the back garden, and I was alone in the house. I moved into the \nhallway and began to pray, praying for protection and sprinkling holy water \naround from a flask I carry on me in these situations. As I spoke the words I felt \nsomething… alarming. I was starting to grow very hot, as though the room was \nheating up very rapidly. I looked around for the source of the heat, but the \nradiators hadn’t been installed yet and I couldn’t see anything else that might \nbe warming the room. It continued, though, and soon I was sweating through \nmy shirt. I began to cough, and I could smell smoke, even though I couldn’t see \nany or any fire, for that matter. \nI fell to one knee and choked back a scream as I felt my skin began to crackle \nand burn. I began to pray again for protection, not for the place this time, but \nfor me. As I did, I felt… something answer me. And yet, I cannot stress this \nenough: what answered was not G-God. It wasn’t Him. Something", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 4, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 4500}}
