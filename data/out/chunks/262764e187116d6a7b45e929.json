I think he \nsaw it as something of a betrayal, and when I finally returned, I knew \nimmediately something had changed between us. He spent the time I was \naway becoming a bit of a crook, and upon my return began what would \neventually become a campaign of petty terror. He was always very careful to \nstop before he did anything that might get the police involved, and I guess \nthere was enough leftover affection from a childhood spent together that I \nnever really thought about reporting him.

I could just as easily complain about her wasting my time. \nELIAS \nThat’s not how it works, Jonathan. \nJONATHAN SIMS \nI wouldn’t even have had to do the recording if Rosie kept her equipment in \nbetter condition. \nELIAS \nRegardless, I would prefer that you not antagonise anyone connected to the \nLukas family. They are patrons of the Institute, after all. \nJONATHAN SIMS \nFine, fine, I’ll be more lovely. Now, can I get back to work? \nELIAS \nVery well. By the way, have you seen Martin? \nJONATHAN SIMS \nOh, he’s off sick this week.

Sure enough, he started \nchatting with me, meaningless jibes that served to wait it out until Ruth, who \ndidn’t know about Jared’s problems with me, returned to her office and closed \nthe door. As soon as she had done so, he turned and in a single movement \ntipped over the metal returns cart, spilling the recently received books all over \nthe floor. He smiled at me and apologised. I did my best not to show any \nirritation, or indeed any reaction at all as I slowly walked around and bent \ndown to start collecting them. As I rose to my feet I felt an impact on the back \nof my head and staggered. Behind me, Jared stood holding the book I had put \naside, The Boneturner’s Tale, and had apparently picked it up to hit me with. \nBut rather than offering me a fake apology or further violence, instead his eyes \nwere locked on the book. We stood there in silence for a few seconds until he \nsaid something about needing something new to read, turned around and \nwalked off. \nI was, I will admit, a bit unsettled. As far as I could recall I had never seen Jared \nread… well, anything, really. And the look in his eyes when he had left had \nsomething in it not entirely unlike fear. Still, it was a welcome relief to have \nhim gone, and I quickly tidied up the rest of the books before Ruth noticed \nanything amiss. \nThere was nothing else I recall that happened that day at the library, but on \nthe way home afterwards I passed by Jared’s house.
