I say technically, as I \nnever spent any time with them beyond the trip up to the Daedalus. Their \nnames were Jan Kilbride and Manuela Dominguez. I’m sure that they probably \ndid a lot more looking after the station than I ever did, but as far as I was \nconcerned, I was the only one up there. From the chatter I heard before the \nmission began, each of us had an experiment of our own to be concerned with, \nbut they were also there as a back-up in case something went horribly wrong \nwith mine, since the observing scientists simply didn’t have the option of \nintervening themselves. I remember the man in charge of my particular \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 057 – Personal Space \n \n4 \n \nproject, Conrad Lukas, made a face of rather overstated disgust when he told \nme I wouldn’t up there entirely on my own. I got the distinct impression he \nwas one of those people who feel that ethical restrictions do nothing but bind \nthe hands of the true scientist and leave them at the mercy of their subject’s \nlimitations. \nMy section of the tiny space station was completely self-contained. There was \nfood, sleeping arrangements and zero gravity exercise equipment all for my \npersonal use. The single entrance to the rest of the satellite was locked and \nsealed. It could be opened from either side, but on my side, it required a code. \nI did have access to the code in case of emergency, but I had way too much \nriding on the mission to even think about being responsible for its early \ntermination. I also had one large, domed window. It allowed me a decent view \nof the earth below, as well as plenty of chance to stare off into space, which I \ndid quite a lot in those early days. I was told the other astronauts would do \ntheir best to avoid that window while doing maintenance or repair work \noutside. Mission control had also supplied me with a lot of books and films and \nother entertainments as, like Conrad had told me at the first briefing, the \nexperiment was into isolation, not boredom. So, when I locked that door for \nthe first time, I was feeling in pretty good spirits about the whole thing to be \nhonest. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 057 – Personal Space \n \n5 \n \nI knew I was being monitored. There was a little camera mounted on the wall \nthat kept a beady eye on me. It wasn’t so invasive that I couldn’t get away \nfrom it when I wanted to, but for the most part I was happy enough to eat and \nread and exercise in front of the watchful lens. Obviously, those assessing my \nprogress would never communicate with me directly, and they might not even \nbe watching a live feed, so if they had opinions on how I was undertaking my \ntask, I never heard them. Even if my task was just sitting around in a room in \nspace, waiting for my mind to break. I tried not to take too much comfort in \nthe knowledge that there were people watching my every move, as I felt that \nto find that reassuring would go quite strongly against the spirit of the \nexperiment. I had to really feel alone. \nThat at least didn’t take too long to set in. I can’t honestly see how strapping \nyourself in to sleep or drinking your juice with a space foil pack on a straw can \nhave much effect on isolation, but I wasn’t going to be the one to bring it up. I \nbelieve some people would have been more disturbed than others by its \nlocation orbiting Earth, but it didn’t feel markedly different to me from any of \nthe other isolation studies they conducted over the last few decades. If \nanything, the silent, rolling green and blue of the Earth far below was another \nsource of comfort, in the sure knowledge of the billions of other people making \ntheir way through life who had no idea what was right above their heads.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 1, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 3781}}
