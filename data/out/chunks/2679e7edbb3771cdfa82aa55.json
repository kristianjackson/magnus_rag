It's a weird feeling. You ever had a near death \nexperience? I've had a few. They're not uncommon in my line of work. But \nthis? It feels different. It's not that I put myself in danger and managed not to \ndie. I should be dead. Decompression sickness that severe is almost never \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG051 – High Pressure \n2 \n \nsurvivable and I should have had an embolism. The fact that I didn't? Blind \nluck. It's hard to reconcile yourself with avoiding a death that you feel should \nhave been yours. If there had been others with me who didn't make it, if I \ncould write it off as survivor's guilt, but... I was alone. You ever get that? Of \ncourse you don't, sorry. Anyway, I'm not here to talk about the bends. \nI'm a diver, both by nature and by trade. I grew up in Halifax, Nova Scotia, and \nwas swimming almost before I was walking. I did my first scuba dive at eight \nyears old – it was barely deeper than a swimming pool, but it was enough to \ninstil a lifelong passion for it. I got fully qualified as soon as I was legally able \nand almost flunked out of college because I was always running off to some \ndive or other. I must have missed more classes than I went to by the end. I \nscraped by, but as it turned out, even if I hadn’t it wouldn't have mattered too \nmuch, as it wasn't my psychology major that got me my first job after \ngraduation. It was diving. \nI worked at a marine salvage company based off the coast of Nova Scotia. \nYou'll forgive me if I don't give their name. I still hold out hope I might go back \nto work there some day and I'd feel like an asshole dragging their name \nthrough the mud, even if it is just to you and your 'strict confidentiality \nprocedures'. If you're desperate, they shouldn't be hard to identify, but it's not \nreally relevant to what happened. \nYou ever heard of 'The Graveyard of the Atlantic'? Probably not, and it's a \nconfusing name anyway since it actually refers to two distinct locations along \nthe eastern coast of North America, both notorious hotspots for shipwrecks. In \nthis case, I'm talking about the one off Sable Island in Nova Scotia.
