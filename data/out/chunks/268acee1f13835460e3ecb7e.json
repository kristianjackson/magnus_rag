You just seem a bit… jumpy, is all. \nARCHIVIST \nOh, I just, er… Coming in I thought… It’s fine. \nMIKE \nGrand. Er, okay, what can I do for you? \n[A cup of tea is made.] \nARCHIVIST \nEr… You’re… you’re Michael Crew, right? \nMIKE \nIt’s Mike, please. \nARCHIVIST \nRight. I’m from the Magnus Institute. \nMIKE \nOh, you, uh, yeah, you said. \nARCHIVIST \nI, er… I read… You feature in some of our statements! \nMIKE \nOh. Statements of what? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG091 – The Coming Storm \n3 \n \nARCHIVIST \nYou… There was, there was a book? Er, two of them, at least. Er… Ex Altiora, \nThe Boneturner’s Tale. You, uh, I think you threw a guy off a skyscraper in Paris. \nMIKE \nHmm. Last chance for that cup of tea. \nARCHIVIST \nI… Where did you get that scar? \n[A sudden rush of air, as if someone is falling] \nMIKE \nAnd I was trying so hard to be polite. \n[The Archivist makes scared noises] \nHard, isn’t it, trying to ask prying questions at terminal velocity? The air… it \ndoesn’t… leave your lungs like you expect it to. I mean, I know you’re still sat \ndown, you know you’re still sat down. But whether your body knows it when I \ndecide you hit the ground, that’s… that’s something I haven’t made my mind \nup about, yet. \nA little bit of privacy. Is that really so much to ask? I suppose it is, isn’t it? From \nyou and yours at least. We have a lot in common, really. After all, what, what \ngood’s the height, the terrifying draw of gravity, unless you, unless you really \nknow the scale of what you’re facing? \nMaybe I’ll let you live, allow you to drag yourself back down to your den, but… \nyou need to learn some respect. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG091 – The Coming Storm \n4 \n \nMIKE (STATEMENT) \nMy scar, wasn’t it? Always the scar. Ironic, in some ways, because that was one \nthe few marks that was only really ever physical. I got it when I was struck by \nlightning, age of eight. I was playing outside with a friend of mine, and the \nstorm just came on quickly. That’s really all there was to it. \nHave you ever been struck by lightning? No. No, of course not. Not unless \nthat’s what happened to your hand, but I’m guessing that burn came from \nsticking it somewhere it wasn’t wanted. And you still didn’t learn. Well, \nimagine a white-hot, stinging pain, your whole body becoming rigid, like for an \neternal moment you’re frozen, you’re trapped in a statue of yourself with a \nthousand needles of agony just erupting through you from the inside out. I \ndon’t know if it’s the most painful thing that can happen to the human body, \nbut… beyond a certain point trying to quantify and measure pain, it becomes \npointless. That point is being struck by lighting. \nThe part that always bothered me was how I didn’t remember it. Not really. \nThe sensation’s still vivid enough, but it exists in my mind completely detached \nfrom any actual memory. I remember the feeling, but not the event. One \nmoment I’m playing amid raindrops the size of blueberries, and the next I’m in \na white hospital bed, that acrid smell still surrounding me, and these lines of \nagony just carved through my skin. \nThe doctors told me there would be no long-term damage from my accident. \nThey, they were wrong, of course, but the damage wasn’t something they \ncould see, so how were they to know? Sitting alone in my room, tracing the \nlines of electricity with my finger, imagining my pain travelling these branching \npathways. I was obsessed with it, and every time my finger reached the end of", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 0, "chunk_count": 5, "chars": 4255}}
