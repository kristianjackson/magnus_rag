Look, let’s keep going. There’s nobody here. \nMICHAEL \nYes there is. \nTIM \nStay back! \nMICHAEL \nNo. \nMARTIN \nWho are you? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG079 – Hide and Seek \n12 \n \nMICHAEL \nI’m Michael. Did the Archivist not tell you about me? \nMARTIN \nNo? \nMICHAEL \nGood. Surprises are better. \nTIM \nWhat are you doing down here? \nMICHAEL \nProbably watching the Archivist die. Maybe not. Either way is amusing. I… I \nthink it’s called ‘a sport’. \nTIM \nWhat? \nMICHAEL \nI think I might also kill you. It would be easier than killing the Archivist. None of \nyou are protected down here. \nMARTIN \nNo, no, now hang on… \nMICHAEL \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG079 – Hide and Seek \n13 \n \nYou are going to try and help him. And I want to see what happens without you \nthere. \nTIM \nMartin… \nMARTIN \nNo, no, okay, because there’s two of us and there’s one of you, okay. He’s not \nkilling anyone! \nTIM \nMartin, look at his hands! \nMARTIN \nOh. \nTIM \nGo! \n[The sound of a door opening and footsteps. Michael laughs and the door \nshuts.] \nTIM \nWhere the hell are we? \n[Tape clicks off. Tape clicks on.] \nARCHIVIST \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG079 – Hide and Seek \n14 \n \nI have no idea where I am. There were stairs. I, I, I kept going lower. No arrows \npointing down, though, which is… good? I don’t know. I found a weapon. Of \nsorts. \n[A metal pipe clangs against the tunnel wall.] \nI don’t know if it’ll help. I mean, it’s not going to help. I can’t fight it with a \npipe. I’m tired just carrying it. But it does make me feel a bit better, so… so \nthat’s something. \nI keep thinking I might have gotten away, but I think it can sense me… uh, at \nleast a bit. I can hide for now, I think, but I don’t know for how long. I can’t kill \nit. I heard the tape. It erased Sasha, just like that. Deleted her from the world. I \njust hope this tape works the same, that my voice remains intact. Even if I’m \ngone, even if it wears a face that people think is mine, pulls me apart, becomes \nme. Listen, it’s not me! Whoever hears this: it is not me. \nI don’t even remember what she looks like. Even now that I know, now I’ve \nseen it twisted and… I still don’t remember her. The only face I can picture is… \nNOT!SASHA \n(Far away) John… John… Come out, come out, wherever you are. \nIt’s okay John; it’s Sasha. Reliable old Sasha. Nothing to be afraid of. (Pause) \nYou seem stressed, John. You’ve been under a lot of pressure. You should talk \nabout it. Have a real good chat. You like talking, don’t you, John? (Pause) \nI’m going to wear you, John. I’m going to wear everything you are. Like you \nnever existed. No-one will even know. And it will hurt. Oh, yes, it will hurt. It \nhurt Sasha. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG079 – Hide and Seek \n15 \n \nARCHIVIST \nShut up! \nNOT!SASHA \n(Closer) There you are. \n[The Archivist runs. The tape clicks off. The tape clicks on. The following \nconversation is distorted by Michael’s corridors.] \nTIM \nWhere the hell are we? \nMARTIN \nI don’t know. I thought… I thought the door led further down. \nTIM \nI don’t think we’re under the Institute anymore. \nMARTIN \nWhat was that thing? \nTIM \nI’m trying not to think about it. It makes my head feel weird. \nMARTIN \nWell? Wh… which way do you think? \nTIM \nEr… Right. Let’s go right.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 2, "chunk_count": 5, "chars": 3307}}
