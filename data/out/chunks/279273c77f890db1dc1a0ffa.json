Mehreen knows if she \ncan just escape it, find where it ends and the sunlight hits the earth, they can \nbe free. They will not be beneath it when the vast being arrives. \nBut there is no hope in her for it, no glimmer of optimism as they hurtle down \nstreet after street. Only the crushing dread, the leaden knowledge that they \nstarted too late, that they're not fast enough, that the shadow reaches a \nthousand miles in every direction, and they could drive for a month. Have they \nbeen driving that long? How many miles have they travelled now? And still \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 174 – The Great Beast \n4 \nthey would never get away, never cross that line from below the shadow into \nopen, sunlit air. \n[A thunderous earth-quaking boom, closer] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nThe world gets darker, and the thing moves closer. It will be upon them any \nmoment now. The car grinds and crunches somewhere in its engine and rolls \nto a stop. Mehreen grabs her daughter, now crying with fear and confusion, \nand begins to run. Where is she running to? It will be upon them all soon, \nwiping out everything they were or are or will be, rendering their lives an \nunremembered blip, crushed beneath its unstoppable significance. It is right \nabove them, and it will. Not. Stop. \nHow long has she been running? Minutes? Days? Her unfamiliar daughter \nlaughs cruelly, carried in Mehreen's exhausted arms. They cannot escape the \nshadow as their doom gets forever closer. \n[A thunderous earth-quaking boom] \n[The blustering wind becomes stronger] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nFar, infinitely far above her, Edward holds his grip tight. His fingers are white \nwith strain, and his own arms burn and ache deeper than he thought possible. \nHe is interlocked, woven into an unending tapestry of suffering, contorted \nbodies. The shape that they create is a mystery to him, but as it moves he can \nfeel his own muscles twitch and stretch with those he holds onto, together \nshifting and pulling and lifting the bulk of the thing of which he is only the \ntiniest part. Where the impulses come from, he does not know, traveling \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 174 – The Great Beast \n5 \nthrough the impossible colossus, rippling down the people who form its bulk. \nMoving as one. He does not know where in the thing he is, but suspects that it \nis not too far from the edge, for sometimes he can see something he might \nalmost believe to be sky. \nSome part of it hits the ground— \n[A thunderous earth-quaking boom] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \n—however distantly below him that may be. A foot, perhaps, or a limb of some \nsort. The shuddering impact of it resonates up through the bodies that \nsurround him, and all at once they cry out in pain. He can hear bones snap and \ntendons rip as the force of the step sharply shifts the twisted arrangement of \nhuman misery. \nEdward's own neck is spun, pushed by the shoulder of the woman crushed in \nbehind him, and turned so far to the side that he is sure another millimetre- \nand it would break entirely. For hours he holds that position, dreading every \nmoment that the next motion of the thing they construct will break him like \nthin porcelain. And then it comes: Not another stepping impact, for those are \nrare and ponderous, but the agonized pull of the whole trying to lift itself. \nEvery muscle in every body tenses all at once, and Edward finds himself \nmoving, pushed and squeezed and gasping for space and… free. \nWithout warning, he finds himself in open air, forced out of the thing like a \nshoot pushing up through the soil. He takes in a deep breath, his protesting \nlimbs now limp and almost useless, and collapses upon a ground that looks up \nat him in envy.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 1, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 3821}}
