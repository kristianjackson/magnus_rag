But I \nknow you’ve been more worried about your choices, about whether you’re \nbeing controlled by me or by the Mother. So, I thought perhaps I should leave \na little something to reassure you that, yes, your actions and your choices have \nall been your own. Have they been controlled? No more than gravity controls \nyou when you walk, or hunger controls you when you choose your meal. There \nare certainly new forces, new instincts and desires that influence you and \nshape your actions. Perhaps you’re unprepared for them, but if you choose to \nbelieve in free will, then yes, all you have done has been of your own free will. \nThey have all been your choices. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 147 – Weaver \n \n12 \n \nNow, I believe the tradition is to tell you the story of my life, the sinister path \nthat led me inevitably to the sorry state in which I now find myself? Well, let it \nnever be said I do not dance the steps I am assigned. \nI was born into what most would consider a large family. My father worked \nconstantly, and my mother was overwhelmed, leaving some of the older \nchildren to watch over the younger ones. Some rose to this responsibility; \nothers deeply resented it and took no pains to hide the fact. I was one of the \nyoungest, and it soon became clear to my infant mind that, in order to get \nanywhere, the key was to navigate the baroque family politics in which I found \nmyself. I became very good at it. I would instigate fights between siblings if I \nneeded them in trouble. If I required sympathy, I would bite myself until I drew \nblood and then blame it on my sister Lizzy. I discovered a deep and enduring \ntalent inside myself for lying. My manipulations were not intricate, but they \nwere far beyond what was expected of a child my age, and I have always \nbelieved that the key to controlling people is to ensure they always under- or \noverestimate you. Never reveal your true abilities or plans. \nOf course, I learned many of my skills from my mother, who could wield guilt \nlike a rapier and anger like a scalpel. She never simply screamed at you. She \nwas always aware of exactly what kind of fury or disappointment was needed \nto make sure you regretted ever catching her attention. She had eight children, \nyet weaved that life around herself in such a way that she always seemed both \nthe victim of it, yet curiously divorced from any responsibility. In many ways, \nshe was the victim, at least of my father, whose pathological absence spoke of \na man who had no interest whatsoever in engaging with the life where he had \ntrapped his family. However well I had learned my lessons, it was clear that \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 147 – Weaver \n \n13 \n \nhappiness was not something I could have within that family. There was simply \ntoo much there that I couldn’t control. \nMy biggest attempt to assert some form of influence over my family was when \nI decided to run away. In my childish mind, I was certain that my \ndisappearance would destabilise the entire family unit, allowing me to take my \nrightful place as the most important child upon my return. An infantile fantasy, \nperhaps, but one I was keen to realise. I intended to stay away for two days \nand two nights. I took a backpack and filled it with as much food as I could \ncarry, which was barely enough for a decent lunch, my favourite blanket and \nthe only book I could say belonged to only me: Five Go Down to the Sea. And \nthen I left. \nWe lived in Hunstanton, in Norfolk, about twenty minutes’ walk from the \nbeach, and it was late spring, so I wasn’t at all worried about the temperature. \nI had chosen where I was to spend the two days I had decided to disappear \nsome weeks before. The air was warm and humid as I snuck out of the house, \nfilled with that slight smell of salt that even now, changed as I am, I still \nsometimes find myself missing here in the grimy air of London. \nIf you walked down the short hill from Hunstanton town centre towards the \nbeach, and took a right just before you reached it, you could find yourself on a \nsmall stretch of sand that seemed oddly quiet. Most days it was completely \ndeserted, and even in those summer holidays where the number of sunbathers \nwas so high no part of the beach could fully escape them, it would only have a \nhandful of dedicated loungers lying around, quietly reading and studiously \nignoring their own unease. Exactly why it remained like that and no-one \nseemed to notice is a mystery to me even now, b", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 3, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 4500}}
