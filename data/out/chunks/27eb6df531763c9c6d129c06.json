I have been exploring the tunnels. \nIt’s been a couple of weeks now. From before I was officially back. If you listen \nto this, Martin, I am sorry. I’ve gone behind your back to explore the tunnels \non… several occasions. I took the key from Elias’ desk some time ago. I don’t \nthink he noticed. Since Martin stopped living in the Archives, I’ve had ample \nopportunities for exploration by night. Part of me still wonders if going down \nthere after dark was more dangerous, but the pitch black of those tunnels \nwould be no different in the daytime. The only light down there is what you \nbring yourself. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG041 – Too Deep \n3 \n \nThe first time I attempted to explore them, I had no idea. I brought one torch \nand that was it. The lights in the archive were off when I arrived at the \nInstitute. I hadn’t been down here since just it was full of worm carcasses. I’d \nnever explored down here by torchlight, and the shadows were… starker than I \nhad anticipated. Every time I walked between the shelves, I swear I would see \nmovement out the corner of my eye. But when I turned, there was nothing. \nObviously there was nothing. Then I came to the trapdoor. \nIf Sasha hadn’t thought to clearly mark it with hazard tape, I’m not sure I would \never have found it again, but there it was. It took several minutes of fumbling \nbefore I was able to figure out how to lift the concealed handle and expose the \nlock, but I managed it. The key turned with a click that I found oddly satisfying, \nand I pulled it open. When I had thought about that moment before, I had \nalways imagined it groaning open with a tortured, ominous creak, but it was \nalmost silent. It glided open as though on freshly oiled hinges, with only the \nfaintest puff of stagnant air being released from beneath it. \nThe opening was utterly black, with the faintest hint of decay in the cold, \nclammy air that rushed out of it. The stairs down it were steep, far steeper \nthan I remembered them from when I had first climbed out, but those \nmemories are... unreliable, and tinged with other, more potent, experiences. I \nturned the torch on, and was pleased by how easily it penetrated the darkness, \nilluminating the rough, grey stone below. I was expecting my torch to be met \nby hundreds of decaying worm husks, but the passage seemed to be empty. I \nheaded down into the tunnel, closing the trapdoor behind me. \nIt is hard to put into words how it felt to be down there, in the cool, \nmouldering air of the tunnels. Have you ever left a crowded room, and literally \nfelt the silence as you walked out into the night? It was something like that, a", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 1, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 2731}}
