Her pencil is broken, but her notes, her warnings from this new world \nare far from complete. \n[Hissing static starts] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nShe snaps off another rib and continues writing. \n(A soft sigh from the Archivist) \n[Hissing static ends] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nRight. \n[Tape clicks off] \n[Tape clicks on] \n[Sounds of distant air raid sirens, distorted crow caws, and trash \nmovement] \n[Martin and the Archivist walk, their crunching footsteps \noccasionally kicking away trash] \nMARTIN \nYou know what? I am sitting down. \n[They stop walking] \nARCHIVIST \nAre… you sure? That thing is... that's not in great shape. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 175 – Epoch \n9 \nMARTIN \n(Unfazed) Neither am I. I have been on my feet for a literally uncountable \namount of time. \n[Martin walks to a soggy couch; as he sits his backpack zippers \njangle, and the couch emits a tired creak and wet squishing] \n(Martin forces out a satisfied sound) \nARCHIVIST \nHow is it? \nMARTIN \n(Forced) Great. It's great. \n[Creak and squelch from the couch] \nMARTIN (CONT’D) \nLovely couch. \nARCHIVIST \nRight. Well, rest up, I suppose! \n[Patting noise] \nMARTIN \nIt's a two-seater! \nARCHIVIST \n(Not interested) Yes it is! \n(Slight amused exhale) \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 175 – Epoch \n10 \n[Another damp creak of the couch] \nARCHIVIST (CONT'D) \nHard pass, thank you. \n[The couch squelches as Martin settles further on it] \n(Beat) \nMARTIN \nWhat was it like? \nARCHIVIST \nWhat? \nMARTIN \nThis place's— its statement. \nARCHIVIST \nNot too surprising. It's a domain designed to eke fear out of those afraid of a \nworld destroyed by human hands. It, uh… It dwells on it. \nMARTIN \nHm. \n[Wet creak as Martin shifts on the couch] \nMARTIN (CONT’D) \nSo it was real then, the Extinction? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 175 – Epoch \n11 \nARCHIVIST \nOf course it was real. A-at least in the sense that, it was a thing people feared. \nWhether it was strong enough in its own right to be considered at a level with \nSmirke's Fourteen, or, whether it was on its way to getting there, I… maybe. \nThis sort of thing is always… muddy. \nMARTIN \nSo Peter was lying. \nARCHIVIST \n(Sighs) To a degree. But, mostly he was just like anyone else who tried to take \nthe scope of human terror and, package it neatly into little theories. All his talk \nof Emergence and, birthing a new power, it's just people being scared. \n[Damp couch creak as Martin shifts; it continues to creak irregularly \nwhenever he speaks] \nMARTIN \nWhat, so no one had any idea? \nARCHIVIST \nMartin, I have the whole scope of human knowledge available to me, and \n(sigh) I'd struggle to give you a simple answer to most of this stuff. And even if \nI am omniscient, I'm starting to realize that... doesn't mean objective. \nMARTIN \nHm. \n(Sigh) I guess it's hard not to bring your own baggage to this sort of thing. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 175 – Epoch \n12 \nARCHIVIST \nI don't know if it could even exist without the baggage. You want to talk about \npsychological projection, try viewing the metaphysical world through the lens \nof a being that is, by its very nature, a reflection of your own obsessions and \nfears. \nMARTIN \n(Sigh) Yeah, alright. I get it. But what about the, real world, were they right? \nARCHIVIST \nI-I'm not sure I follow. \nMARTIN \nI mean— Right, if none, if none of this had happened, if the world had just… \ncarried on? What would have happened? Was, was all that fear justified? \nARCHIVIST \nI can't know the future, Martin, not even a hypothetical one. \nMARTIN \nBut, you know what was going on, what was happening. O-out of everyone, \nyou're the best placed, you, you've got the info to make a pretty damn \neducated guess! \nARCHIVIST \nI, I don't know what you want me to say, Martin.
