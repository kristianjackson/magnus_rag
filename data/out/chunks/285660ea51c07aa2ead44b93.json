It wasn’t much, but I could \nsee a slightly warped image. It was Pavel, in this case. I saw him pick up a bone \n– a radius I believe, from the forearm. He held it up next to his own arm, and \nthen there came that snapping, crunching noise. I swear I saw his arm distend \nitself, the skin shifting as something inside changed and rearranged, until it \nmatched the length of bone he was holding up to it. \nI tried not to react, not to make a noise at this mad impossibility that I saw. I \ncouldn’t help it, though, and my legs gave out. I collapsed on the floor with a \nwhimpering cry. None of them looked at me, none of them offered to help me \nup, none of them gave any reaction at all. I shut my eyes tight as that cracking \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG034 – Anatomy Class \n9 \n \nsound began to come from every direction, as all seven of them began to \nchange themselves. It went on for almost half an hour, until our allotted time \nin the lab ended. And then they left, walking past me, still sat helpless on the \nfloor. As they did, each of them thanked me for the lesson as though nothing \nhad happened. And I swear that every single one of them was taller than when \nthey started. \nI started taking more sick leave after that. I avoided their tutorials as often as \npossible, and when I did go we largely just sat there in silence until one of \nthem asked a question about human anatomy, which I would reluctantly \nanswer. I know I should have just abandoned them entirely. If they were going \nto complain to anyone they would have done it already. But even then I was \nworried my colleagues might notice, and I really didn’t want to get a reputation \nas some absentee tutor. It didn’t help that a colleague of mine, Dr Laura Gill, \nonce expressed surprise on learning I’d been absent the day before, as \napparently she’d passed by my teaching room and my anatomy class had just \nbeen sat there, waiting quietly. The thought of them politely filing into every \ntutorial, just sat there, blank and staring, whether I was there or not, just \nwaiting... To be quite frank I think that bothered me almost more than being \nsat there with them. \nStill, I managed to largely avoid them until the 21st of March, when they had \ntheir second lab dissection. Hearts. I’m not an idiot. I was well aware of the \nsort of sinister nonsense that was likely to happen if I went, but I also knew by \nnow that they would attend whether or not I was there.
