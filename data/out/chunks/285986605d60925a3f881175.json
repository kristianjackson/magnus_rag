The Magnus Archives. Episode one hundred and ninety-\nfour: \"Parting.\" \n[Theme finishes] \n[Tape clicks on] \n[The tower stairs: cameras iris movements and faint whispers are \naudible; a faint pulsing tone permeates the background; and \ndistant muffled helicopter and drone sounds] \n[Footsteps descend the tower stairs hastily; the Archivist doing so \nmore rapidly than Martin] \n(Martin breaths heavily) \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 194 – Parting \n \n2 \nMARTIN \nJohn, wai— Hey, just wait! \n[The Archivist’s footsteps pause as Martin catches up] \nMARTIN \nW— Will you please talk to me? \nARCHIVIST \nI just— I-I need some air. \nMARTIN \nIn the tunnels? \nARCHIVIST \nYes! N-no! I, I don’t know, just somewhere! Anywhere, without that... thing \ndroning horrors, and Rosie staring at us like we’re gonna bite her. I just— I \nneed to think. \nMARTIN \nAlright. \nAlright, we’ll, we’ll go back to the tunnels and, regroup, figure out what our \nnext move is. See what other options there are. \n(Beat) \nARCHIVIST \nYeah. (quiet) Yeah. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 194 – Parting \n \n3 \nMARTIN \nJohn?… \n(Warning) John? \nARCHIVIST \nI just need a moment. To, to properly consider things. \nMARTIN \n“Consider” what exactly? \n(Beat) \nARCHIVIST \n(Quietly) It-It might be our only option. \nMARTIN \n(Vehemently) What are you talking about?! H-how is it an “option”? Okay, \nsetting aside the fact that it’s a suicidal idea, it’s just completely stupid! What \nactual good would it do? Right now, as far as I can see, we’d just be swapping \none self-important, floating, hollowed-out terror zombie for another! \nARCHIVIST \nIt’s not like that. \nMARTIN \nReally? Then please enlighten me. Go on, I’m all ears! \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 194 – Parting \n \n4 \nARCHIVIST \n(Quiet) Look. (normal) Right well when I said I would ‘replace’ Jonah in there, \nthat’s not— er— That place, the centre of The Eye, i-it’s... It wasn’t made for \nhim. That’s why he’s like that, it’s too much, it’s overwhelmed him, his whole \nbeing, just destroyed. \nMARTIN \n(Sarcastic) Oh yeah? But let me guess, it was made for you? \nARCHIVIST \nYes. \nMARTIN \n(Petulantly) Of course it is. Of course it is! Because how could this journey \npossibly end with anything less than the final, supreme destiny of the Archivist, \nplugged into the great fear machine for all eternity and, and abandoning \nhumanity. \nBreaking his promise. \nARCHIVIST \n(Snapping) That’s not fair! \nMARTIN \nIsn't it? \nARCHIVIST \nWould you just listen? Please? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 194 – Parting \n \n5 \nI think… I think that I, I could control it, t-to a degree. I could, I could channel \nthe energies, remake things — like I’ve been doing on our journey, but, but on \na grand scale. \nMARTIN \nAnd how’s that going to help? You’ve always said you can’t make less fear in \nthe world. You’d, you’d just be moving it around. \nARCHIVIST \nBut that might still help. I-I could, I could rebalance things. Destroy the avatars, \nmake it so that the people suffering most were the ones who, who deserve it. \nMARTIN \n(Scoffing) And what? Replace them with new avatars from the people who \ndon’t want to? \nARCHIVIST \nI mean, that has to be better than those that chose it right? Sure I can’t make it \n“go away”, but I could at least make it fairer. \n(Martin scoffs at this justification) \nThe Eye doesn’t care, as long as it gets its fear, it’s happy either way. \nMARTIN \n(Incredulous) Christ, can you hear yourself? “Make it fairer!” It’s not enough \nthat you’re the ‘all-powerful Archivist’, you also have to appoint yourself the \nliteral judge of everyone as well?", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 0, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 4101}}
