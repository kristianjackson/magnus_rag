I thought \nthere'd be so much more stuff up there, days more sorting to go through. But \nwhen I turned on the light, I saw that it was almost completely empty. The only \nthings there were an old steamer trunk, a small stool and a bright red calliope \norgan. The ceiling was higher than I expected as well. I could stand at my full \nheight without stooping. I walked slowly towards the old steam organ. It was \nbright red and in excellent condition except for a thick layer of dust. There was \na small brass plaque simply reading “The Calliaphone”. The brass pipes that \nstuck out from the top still shone faintly under the dust, and I noticed that \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG024 – Strange Music \n4 \n \nthere was writing, carved onto the cover of the keyboard. It read: “Be still, for \nthere is strange music”. \nI went to the steamer trunk next, and was surprised to find it unlocked. \nOpening it released a cloud of dust and I coughed a few times before I got the \nheavy lid up. Inside were dolls. Lots of them. They looked old, with ragged, \nlimp cloth bodies topped with oversized round heads and large, painted eyes \nthat stared up from their shadowed trunk. The hair on each was intricate and \nwoollen, and while they certainly weren't the sort of dolls a ventriloquist \nwould use, the heads had similar mouths, wooden blocks that would have \nopened and closed to simulate speech. At least, they should have had. Almost \nall of them had had their jaw block roughly torn off, leaving nothing but jagged \nsplinters between their cheeks. \nThere were 23 dolls I counted in total, and only one of them still had its jaw \nintact. It was the oldest looking by far, and was a small clown doll. Its \nthreadbare body was white and purple polka-dot, with three pompoms down \nthe front and a ruff just below the head. It had no woollen hair left, but instead \nhad a tall, pointed white cap on top. Its face was painted a pure white, and its \neyes were shut, with black lines drawn across them. The only colour was a \nsplash of red across the hinged jaw. A smile. \nLike I said, I'm not scared of clowns and I'm not scared of dolls. The thing was \nugly though. I was kind of relieved, actually, to have found some of my \ngrandpa's old things that I would have no problem throwing away. Or maybe \nselling. They were definitely antiques, so they might have been worth \nsomething. In any case, I put the nasty-looking clown doll back in the box and \nclosed the lid. I definitely closed the lid. \n[Sound of a Door Opening] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG024 – Strange Music \n5 \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nI went back over to the calliope. There was… \n \nSASHA \nI thought it was pronounced Ka-lee-o-pee? \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nSasha? You're… back early – I thought you were trying to get hold of those \npolice reports for the Harold Silvana case? \n \nSASHA \nTried and succeeded. They were actually quite helpful. \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nOh. well. Good work. \n \nSASHA \nSo, do we know if it's pronounced “Ka-lee-o-pee” or “Kuh-ly-o-pee”? \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nI have also heard it said as “Ka-lee-ope”. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG024 – Strange Music \n6 \n \n \nSASHA \nSeriously? By who? \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nAmericans. \n \nSASHA \nAh. \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nAs far as I can tell there isn't a “correct” pronunciation. But they were originally \nnamed after the Greek muse Calliope, so... \n \nSASHA \nAre people going to understand that it’s from Greek mythology? \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nIf they're working for the Magnus Institute, then I would hope so. \n \nSASHA", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 2, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 3542}}
