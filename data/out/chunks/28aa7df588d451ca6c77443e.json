Benoît’s hygiene more generally also started \nto noticeably decline. At first, his shirts would be wrinkled when he arrived for \nwork, when before I had only ever seen him wear them crisply ironed. Then \nthere were small stains or tears that could be spotted, as his clothes seemed to \nbe washed less and less regularly. \nAgain, none of this was glaringly obvious, and if his behaviour hadn’t drawn my \nattention, it’s likely I never would have noticed it at all. Certainly, none of the \npatrons of Le Papillon Blanc ever seemed bothered by his appearance or \ncleanliness. \n\nThrough all of it, he would talk incessantly to anyone who would listen about \nthis woman who had apparently changed his life, “mon petit scarabée”, his \nlittle beetle. I was never able to get her actual name from Benoît, as he only \nseemed to refer to her by that weird nickname. Clear details were also difficult \nto establish: he could talk for an hour over what his little beetle had told him \nover breakfast, but when asked about what she did, where she was from, what \nshe looked like, he would always find a way to talk around it and shift the \nconversation in a new direction. We managed to establish that she had \nchildren, as Benoît would often make reference to “the little ones”, his eyes \nlighting up with parental pride. They couldn’t have been his, obviously, but \nthat didn’t seem to matter to him. But, as with their mother, solid details \nabout these children were almost impossible to establish. I would have \nsuspected this new family of his wasn’t even real, were it not for the fact that \nhe was clearly not faking his joy or contentment. Either his “petit scarabée” \nwas real, or Benoît was suffering from a very complex delusion indeed. It never \noccurred to me it might have been both. \nIt was… two days ago that it happened. I was thinking earlier how unlikely it \nwas, to have been looking so precisely at such a specific spot at such a specific \ntime as to make me absolutely sure of what I witnessed. If I had glanced over a \nsecond later or only caught it from the corner of my eye, I could easily have \ndismissed it. After all, the simple presence of insects is not, in and of itself, \nremarkable. It was the where this particular insect came from, however, that \nshook me so deeply. Benoît was leaning over the bar, listening to a young man \nwho, I believe, was ordering for quite a large group. As this customer listed off \nhis drinks, Benoît’s hand rested lightly upon the countertop, and I found, for no \nreason I could readily provide, my gaze was resting upon the fingers of his \nhand.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 4, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 2724}}
