Still, better than outside. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 161 – Dwelling \n20 \n[Pause, as the sound of strange and distant howls and the building \nwood creaks continue] \nMARTIN (CONT’D) \nIt sounds bad. \n(The Archivist laughs a strange, humorless laugh) \nARCHIVIST \nIt is. \n(Beat) \nMARTIN \nAre we still safe? \nARCHIVIST \nY-Yes. It- It doesn’t want to harm me. \nMARTIN \nAnd me? \nARCHIVIST \nI won’t let it. \nMARTIN \nUm, thanks. \n(Beat) \n[Breaths and clothing rustle] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 161 – Dwelling \n21 \nMARTIN (CONT’D) \nJohn, it’s not your fault. \nARCHIVIST \n(Sharp) Martin, can we not do this again? \nMARTIN \nSorry. \nARCHIVIST \nI’m just- I’m mourning a world I killed- \nMARTIN \n(Placating) I know- \nARCHIVIST \n(Increasingly fervent) and we’re all trapped in its rotting corpse!- \nMARTIN \nEnough, John. \n[The Archivist starts taking a cassette tape out of its case] \nARCHIVIST \nHave you heard the Gertrude one? \nMARTIN \nWhat? \n[The tape is placed in a tape deck] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 161 – Dwelling \n22 \nARCHIVIST \nThe Gertrude one; there are a few of them, but this is my favourite. \nMARTIN \n(Sigh) I don’t- \nARCHIVIST \nJust. Listen. \n[Tape click] \n[A quiet space] \nGERTRUDE \nRight. If you’re listening to this, then it is likely that— (sighs) No. Let’s not beat \naround the bush. If you’re listening to this, it means I’m dead. And you have \nbeen chosen to be my replacement as Head Archivist. \nHopefully, this means you, Sasha, but if someone else is hearing this, and Elias \nhas made a different choice for some reason, then these words are still very \nmuch intended for you. \nBefore I continue: it is very important to be absolutely clear this is not a joke. \nNor is it any sort of prank, or game. Your colleagues have not convinced me to \nrecord this as an attempt to... haze you. This is completely serious. And very, \nvery important for you to know. \nIf it is you I’m talking to, Sasha, hopefully your background in Artifact Storage \nwill lend a certain degree of... credence to my words. But others may have to \ntake it on trust. \nAll I can do is assure you I am deadly serious. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 161 – Dwelling \n23 \n(sigh) So. The first thing you have to do is accept that you are in great danger, \nand will be for the rest of your life. There are now things that will actively be \ntrying to kill you, due to your new role as Archivist, and Elias has plans for you \nthat are little better. \nYou will also be unable to relinquish the position or quit the Institute, finding \nyou are supernaturally compelled to remain. \nIn fact, it occurs to me that attempting to do so is probably the quickest and \neasiest way to establish the truth of what I am telling you, so I suggest you do \nso at the earliest possible opportunity. \nThings you need to be aware of: there exists in our world supernatural entities \nof incredible power that reflect and feed on the fears of all living creatures, but \nmost commonly humans. Many consider them gods, and while I believe that is \nfar too simplistic a comparison, for our purposes here it is perhaps the most \nuseful shorthand. They do not rule our world, but they do exercise \nconsiderable power, which they generally manifest in the form of monstrous \nbeings that spread further fear or incarnations, those humans who have \nwillingly, though not always knowingly, chosen to take on the power of these \nentities. \nYou, unfortunately, have unwittingly made the decision to become one of \nthose incarnations. For the Institute serves a being variously known as: The \nEye, It Knows You, The Beholding, The Ceaseless Watcher. It is the fear of being \nwatched, and judged, and having all your secrets known. The Institute serves \nas a way for it to harvest the fears of the other entities, dragging out the \nsuffering of those who come to give statements and claiming their terror.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 3, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 4082}}
