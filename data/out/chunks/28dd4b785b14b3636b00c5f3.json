It \nwas an odd building, with modern glass and concrete sections sprouting from \nold turreted brickwork, like blocky stone tumours. \nThe look of the place wasn’t why I liked it, though. No, that was the residents. \nIvy Meadows was almost entirely populated by those elderly who were \nentirely supported by the state. Most pensioners have some savings or \nproperty or family to support them, which means if they’re unable to live alone \nthey can at least afford to pay for their own care or some of it. It’s rare for a \nperson to reach that age and have literally nothing to pay for their care, but it \ndoes happen. In these cases, the state pays for them, but they have little \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG036 – Taken Ill \n5 \n \nchoice in where they end up. Ivy Meadows was almost entirely populated by \nthese. Old people without money or family, sent to be looked after by \nstrangers. You’d have expected the atmosphere to be unpleasant, some \nmorbid combination of prison and hospice, but it was quite the opposite. \nSomething about the mutual loneliness seemed to lead them to create a real \nsense of community. It was the only place I ever went where the residents still \ngave me a smile. Hannah Ramirez, who ran the place, would always tell me a \nbit about the deceased and their time there, and I was inevitably shocked by \ntales of drugs, sexual escapades and other gossip that sounded more like a \nhigh school than a nursing home. I think Hannah enjoyed trying to get a \nreaction out of me when I was trying to be solemn. It was just a happy place, \neven if I was only there to do a sad duty. \nIt all started to change about three months ago, after Hannah left. I don’t know \nexactly when she left her post or why; we hadn’t had a call from Ivy Meadows \nfor a couple of months, so it must have happened during that period. I don’t \nknow where she moved to, either. It certainly wasn’t any of the other care \nhomes around Woodley, and it wasn’t like I knew her personally. I’d gotten a \ncall from one of the nurses, Alenka Kozel, who said that one of their residents \nhad taken ill and passed away, a man by the name of Bertrand Miller. I asked \nher for a few more details; she started to say something else, but the call was \ncut off almost abruptly. I didn’t really think too much about it, most of the \ndetails could be worked out when we arrived, so I called Josh and loaded up \nthe car for a removal. \nIt was a hot mid-August day, and the air was thick and humid, making \neverything feel sticky, like the whole world was running a fever. The sky was \novercast, though, an orangey-grey that cast muted shadows and seemed to \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG036 – Taken Ill \n6 \n \nmuffle the world. It was about a ten minute drive to Ivy Meadows, and neither \nof us said a word. I don’t know why, at that point we had no idea that there \nwas anything wrong, but looking back it seems like we both felt there was \nsomething off about it. Or maybe we were just too hot for conversation and \nhindsight is colouring my memories. \nWhen we arrived the place was silent. There were no cars in the parking area, \nwhich was not unusual, but I couldn’t see a soul anywhere on the grounds. \nMaybe they were simply staying out of the heat. Josh and I got out of the car \nand approached the door. I pressed the buzzer, as I had done so many times \nbefore, expecting the cheery voice of one of the receptionists. Instead there \nwas just dead air, followed by the clunk of the door being remotely unlocked. I \nlooked at Josh, who shrugged, and we went inside. \nIvy Meadows Care Home was usually much as you would find any other – air \nconditioned, and smelling faintly of cleaning products and cheap potpourri. \nThis time it was different. The smell now was just as faint, but seemed… rancid, \nwhile the air itself was close and damp. The beige walls seemed dirtier than \nbefore, with dark marks at roughly hand-height. There was a faint buzzing, like \na fly, but I couldn’t see any source for it. \nNone of it was so bad as to make us turn back, however, and we headed \ntowards the reception desk. There was nobody behind it, and I rang the bell. I \nalways wore gloves when on a removal, and was glad of that fact now, as I \nnoticed a greasy residue on top of the small brass bell. The door to the \nreception opened, and a tall man stepped out. He was rail thin and wore a \nfaded brown suit that seemed to have been cut for a much fatter man.
