The three figures behind him were all much taller than him, but each was \nstick thin and moved with a jerkiness to their motions. I looked back to where \nthe strange, staring man had been, but he had retreated inside his shop, and \nthe lights were now off, so I began to follow the man I thought to be Alfred \nGrifter as he and his companions moved down the street. The others all carried \ninstrument cases as well, and no one else on the street seemed to pay them \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG042 – Grifter’s Bone \n8 \n \nany notice at all, not even when the tallest physically shoved a man out of his \npath. \nFinally, they turned down a flight of stairs, into a basement jazz bar I didn't \nrecognise. After a few seconds I followed them. The bar was dimly lit and \nquiet, with red and orange lights giving it a warm, smoky feel. Patrons stood \naround drinking and chatting. I counted eleven in total. I remember I made a \nnote of the number because of how empty the place was. Most seemed to be \ndressed for an evening of jazz, but I noticed a few of them seemed to be \nwearing thick coats or jackets, and one, an older white man with a shock of \nsilver hair, appeared to be wearing a silk bathrobe. Behind them, on the stage, \nGrifter's Bone were setting up their instruments. \nNow, despite everything that happened thus far appearing to show the \ncontrary, I am not an idiot. I remembered Lee's story very clearly indeed, and \nhad no intention of staying for the show. \nInstead, I took out my phone, set it recording video, and placed it in a small \nalcove near the entrance with a good view of the stage. I checked to make sure \nthe microphone was working, and then I left. I stood at the top of the stairs \ninto that dingy jazz club and I waited. \nAfter a few minutes of shivering in the cold, I thought I had made a mistake. \nThe streets were deserted, and the previously mild November night had taken \non a bone-deep chill. Then I heard it. Muffled through the walls, but still rising \ndistinctly to where I stood, a note. A single, clear note, from what sounded like \na cello. It was joined by others, a keyboard, a guitar, and over them all the pure \npiping sound of a flute. It was beautiful. It was some of the most achingly \nbeautiful music I had ever heard. Then the screams began. There was no build-\nup to the screams; no lead-up to explain the sudden eruption of sounds of \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG042 – Grifter’s Bone \n9 \n \nagony. There were crashes as well, noises of impact and, once or twice, \nsomething that sounded like tearing. Through it all, in the background, played \nthat beautiful music. I stood there, frozen in place, not wanting to go down \nthere, but not feeling able to flee, as below all I could hear was haunting music \nand butchery. \nI went to pull out my mobile to phone the police, but I realised I had left it \ndown there, recording in the jazz club. I finally made the decision to run for \nhelp, when the noises ceased abruptly, and there was silence. I looked around \nfor anyone who might have heard the cries of pain and panic, and be coming to \nhelp, but there was no-one. Just me. I began to slowly, carefully, make my way \ndown towards the basement. If whoever was down there wanted to kill me, I \nwould be easy enough to find with the information on my phone. One way or \nanother I was at their mercy. \nWhen I opened the door it was hard to know exactly what I was looking at. In \nthe dull red light, the torn and mangled remains of the people I had seen alive \nnot half an hour ago, were almost indistinguishable from the carpet and \nfurnishings. On stage, the musicians calmly packed away their instruments. \nThey did not have a spot of blood on them. The one in the brown suit, who I \nassumed to be Alfred Grifter, looked up. He gazed straight into my eyes and \nsaid, “Encore?” I grabbed my phone and ran. \nI didn't phone the police. I was too scared of what might happen. I watched the \nnews obsessively, waiting to see anything on the massacre, but there was \nnothing. It's been almost a week now, and I've heard nothing. I haven’t been \nable to access the footage from that night. My phone says it's incorrectly \nformatted somehow, but I'll keep trying. I did go back to the jazz club, but I can", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 4, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 4493}}
