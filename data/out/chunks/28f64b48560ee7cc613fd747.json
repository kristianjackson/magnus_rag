He choked as it started to \nfill his throat, and I tried, I really tried, to reach out and help him, but he still \nslashed at me with those mutilated hands, and I couldn’t get close enough. \nThen it was quiet. Ross still stood there, baton raised in exactly same position, \nseemingly frozen in confusion and disgust. She looked at me, as if I might have \nany explanation, but what the hell was I supposed to say? We just kept looking \nat this broken man, her friend, who had literally killed himself attacking us. I \nwent back to the car to radio for help, but it didn’t seem to be working right. \nAll I could hear from it was the faint noise of static and what sounded like \nbagpipes. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 125 – Civilian Casualties \n \n5 \n \nI walked back over to Ross, who was now crouched over the body of Callum \nMcKenzie. She looked up at me and shook her head slowly. Standing back up, I \ncould see her hand was slick and red. Then she pointed silently over my \nshoulder. My breathing was erratic, and I could feel the tell-tale signs of shock \nstarting to creep into my body, but I forced myself to turn around. All I could \nsee was the white one-storey cottage behind me, but then my eyes fixed on \nthe broken window and the streaks of blood around the door. I knew what she \nwas thinking, and I just nodded, took out my own baton, and quietly \napproached the small house. \nIt was silent – no sound at all, save for the bleating of a sheep in a nearby field. \nI’ve never quite got the hang of sheep. I know that sounds daft, but it’s their \nthroats, you see. They’re so like humans that when they, ‘baaa’, it doesn’t, it \ndoesn’t sound like sheep. Does that make sense? It sounds like a person \npretending to be a sheep. Sheep don’t kill each other, though. Not like this. \nAnyway, the sound didn’t exactly do anything to put me at my ease. \nWhen we entered the house, I instinctively reached out for a light switch, but \ncouldn’t find one. A lot of these old crofter places don’t have any electricity, or \nat least not mains power. It didn’t matter, though, there were plenty of \nwindows to light up the scene in front of us. \nThe fireplace had long since burned out, but the rocking chair next to it was \nstill occupied. An elderly woman sat there, a blanket over her legs and a cross- \nstitch frame in her lap. If it wasn’t for the cook’s knife that pinned her to the \nchair through her throat, I’d have almost called her serene. Her feet didn’t \nquite touch the floor, so the draft from the open door rocked her back and \nforth, back and forth. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 125 – Civilian Casualties \n \n6 \n \nOn the floor in front of her, two corpses, middle-aged with rough, weathered \nfaces, were entwined together, in an embrace that almost looked affectionate, \nuntil you saw the blood staining their teeth and hands, or the ear still clenched \nin the younger man's smile, freshly torn from the other’s head. They had each \nhad their own throats cut crudely, and plastered across their faces was a smile \nthat seemed to occupy a frozen space halfway between ecstasy and an all-\nconsuming anger. Neither of them had any fingers left at all. \nTheir murderer was in the kitchen, head forced into an oven, now cold, and \nburned beyond recognition. The bloody vegetable knife was limp in her hand, \nand the glass embedded in the back of her neck placed her death firmly at the \nfeet of Callum McKenzie. At this, Ross let out a small cry and left the room to \nbe sick. I was feeling completely numb by now, and felt nothing but a dull \nfascination when I saw the circle pattern of cuts on the dead woman's right \narm. The angles made it almost certainly self-inflicted, and it gave the \nimpression the skin was a simple tug from coming away like a peeled potato. \nThe back door was kicked in, and I could see a small lump of pink flesh just \nbeyond it, and then another. The ground was disturbed as though by a \nstruggle, and I suddenly realised what had happened. Ross had returned by \nnow, shaking and pale but just as quiet as I was, and together we followed a \ntrail of bitten-off fingers like breadcrumbs taking us home. \n‘Home’ in this case was the lawn just outside the cottage of Angus Stewart, an \nacre or so of land he kept clear for meetings, parties or whatever other events \nthe tiny community might find they needed space for. Yesterday it had been \nthe parking of a small, sky blue transit van. I recognised it, of course: it \nbelonged to a young lady from Inverne", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 2, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 4499}}
