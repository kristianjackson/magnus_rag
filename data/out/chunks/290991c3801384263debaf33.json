I even found some \nstairs at one point, but I really didn’t want to go down them. I hadn’t \nseen any worms for a few minutes, and weirdly enough that \nactually started to worry me, like, if there weren’t any worms then \nI’d gone too far from the Institute. And there was more dust in \nthose corridors too, and dead rats, even some discarded wine \nbottles. At one point there was an empty packet of mint imperials— \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nMartin… \n \n \nMARTIN \nSorry. Yeah. Um. I was trying to go back, not that I knew what back \neven meant down there, when I heard the scream. I don’t even \nknow how to go about describing it, but I thought... well I hoped... \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG040 – Human Remains \n19 \n \nWell, when I started to find the shrivelled bodies of worms all over \nthe place, I knew she was dead. So I wanted to get out of there. I \nwas looking for a way up, but it felt more and more like I was \ntrapped. Every turn just led me to another empty corridor. When I \nfinally found a door, I thought it might actually get out, but \ninstead... It was a small room. Square. There was dust on \neverything. Cardboard boxes were piled around. They were full of \nold cassette tapes. \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nThat’s where you found her? \n \nMARTIN \nYes. She was sat in a wooden chair in the middle of the room. No \nworms. No cobwebs. Just… an old corpse. Gertrude Robinson. She \nwas slumped forward, but I could see her mouth hanging open. So I \nran, and I found the trapdoor soon afterwards. \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nCould you find the room again? \n \nMARTIN \nI don’t know. Maybe. The police certainly expect me to, although I \ngot the feeling they’re not too keen to explore the tunnels either. \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nMartin, how did Gertrude Robinson die? \n \nMARTIN \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG040 – Human Remains \n20 \n \nI don’t know. Not for sure. It was so dark, and I only saw the body \nfor a few seconds. The police were quite clear that the cause of \ndeath could be absolutely any… \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nMartin! How did she die? \n \nMARTIN \nShe was shot! Three times, that I could see. Three shots to the \nchest. \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nRight. Right. Thank you Martin. \n \nMARTIN \n... Sure. \n \n[CLICK] \n[CLICK] \n \n \n \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nGertrude Robinson, the last Archivist at the Magnus Institute, and \nmy predecessor, was murdered. There were no worms to infest her, \nno strange, ghostly apparitions to warp her mind, or caves to \nentomb her. She was killed, in the Archives, by someone who used \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG040 – Human Remains \n21 \n \na gun, and that scares me far more than any spectre or twisted \ncreature. Because that means someone here is a killer. \nThe police will investigate thoroughly, I have no doubt, but… given \ntheir track record in this matter I am not optimistic. \nThere is something in these files, in these statements. I know that \nnow, some deeper mystery. I think Gertrude Robinson found it, and \nI think that is why they killed her. \nSome of my tapes are missing. Maybe it was Prentiss, but she \nseemed more interested in the written files, and the other tapes \nseem fine. There’s no sign of debris, or anything that would \nindicate they’ve been destroyed, but, in addition to the tape Sasha \nlost earlier, the tapes for cases 0051701 and 0160204 are gone. \nI don’t know why these two specifically, but I cannot trust anyone. \nI’m going to figure this out, and I’m not going to stop. \nThey’ll have to kill me first. \nEnd recording. \n[CLICK] \n[The Magnus Archives Theme - Outro] \n \nThe Magnus Archives is a podcast distributed by Rusty Quill and \nlicensed under a creative commons attribution, non-commercial \nshare alike 4.0 international license.
