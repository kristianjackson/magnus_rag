One of them was Father \nSingh. \nIt was dark when I left the presbytery. I had no idea where I was going or why; I \njust had the desperate need to be somewhere else. The streets of Oxford \nshould have been full of drunken students at that time on a Sunday night, at \nleast, I thought it was Sunday, but they were almost deserted. Occasionally, I \nwould see figures standing or walking at the end of the narrow streets, but \nthey were shadowy, silhouetted against what little light there was, and were \nalways gone when I approached. I tried once again to pray but the words died \non my tongue. I have never felt despair on the sheer scale I did at that \nmoment. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG020 – Desecrated Host \n5 \n \nThe streets of Oxford are winding, and speak to the age of the place, but I had \nlived there for no small amount of time and knew them well. That night, \nthough, it was as though I had never walked them before. I saw roads that I \nhad travelled a hundred times, but they seemed different, my eyes focusing on \ndetails I had never before marked, and at each turn I found I did not know \nwhere I was going or what place it would take me to. The world I knew had \nbecome alien to me, and I simply didn’t know what to do. \nFinally, I found myself in front of The Oratory on Woodstock Road. The \nchurch’s large round window shifted as I watched, as though it were a \ntremendous eye that were turning to focus upon me. The door was open and \nfrom within, a warm light spilled out. Even in the depths of my – I suppose you \ncould call it mania – there was something comforting about that light. A man \nappeared at the door. He was tall and pale, and dressed as an altar server. \nI walked up to him. My vision was blurred, though I could not tell you whether \nit was my state of mind at the time or simply that I was crying. I should have \nknown that something was wrong. I did know that something was wrong, but it \ndidn’t matter. I had no fight left within me, so when he told me that it was \ntime for Mass, I simply nodded and followed. \nHe led me through the church. It was bright, so bright. Candles covered every \nsurface, each glowing so powerfully that I could barely look directly at them. \nThe layout was how I remembered, but the pews were all empty, and I could \nsee none of the statues or crosses that I expected. The man led me unresisting \ninto the vestry, where I found my cassock and stole laid out in front of me. The \nstole was not green as I would have expected for a normal Sunday mass, nor \nwas it violet or red or any other liturgical colour. Instead it was a pale, sickly \nyellow. I felt the eyes of the altar server upon my back, and dressed quickly.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 2, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 2722}}
