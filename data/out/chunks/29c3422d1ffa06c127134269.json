I was \ndreading an awkward Lithuanian math student sitting in the corner with a glass \nof orange juice, staring at us as we self-consciously talked about… \ndecomposition rates and timelines. But those worries vanished as soon as \nJamie opened the door. The person who stood on the other side of it was \ndefinitely not one of my flatmates. \nThe first thing I noticed was the height. They were well over six foot, and the \ntop of their head disappeared above the door. The second thing was the mask, \npure white polystyrene, and cut into the rough shape of some kind of demon \nor wolf. The third thing I noticed was the knife. \n\nJamie noticed it too, and leapt backwards just as the figure lunged towards \nhim. Suddenly everything was moving. Everyone was on their feet, shouting as \nthe figure lumbered clumsily inside, swinging wildly at everyone who got near. \nI dashed to the small kitchen, and reached for a knife of my own, never taking \nmy eyes off my target. It was a strange thing to watch. I would have expected \neveryone to be running; Evelyn and Debbie both had a clear path to the open \ndoor, but instead we were all just watching, keeping as much distance as \npossible, occasionally making a motion to disarm him, staying just out of the \nblade’s path. As I reached for another knife, I found myself tapping my foot, as \nif to music. \nOur attacker was starting to slow now, his movements becoming laboured, his \nlunges predictable and weak. When he swung at Andrew, his blade went too \nwide, and he overbalanced. Ananya didn’t waste a second, dropping down and \nkicking him hard in the back of the knee. He fell like… like an ancient tree, and \nhis head slammed into the corner of the old wooden coffee table with a nasty \nthud. It tore through the thin grey string that held the mask in place. He lay \nthere motionless. \nThe face underneath was nothing special. A bald man, maybe forty years old? \nNone of us knew him. He wasn’t an infamous murderer, or someone with a \npersonal vendetta; he was just a man who came to my home to kill us. \nEveryone had gone very quiet, but it wasn’t like a silence of shock or terror. It \nwas more like a heavy silence of waiting for something to happen. Of \nexpectation. Debbie finally spoke up, saying we should call the police, but she \nwas lying and we all knew it. I looked down at my hands, and realised I’d \npicked up six knives from the kitchen drawer. Two were chef’s knives, three \nwere for vegetables and one was a battered old bread knife. All of them were \n\nsharp enough to do the job, even if I still hadn’t quite figured out what the job \nwas. \nI walked slowly over to the unconscious figure on the floor. The others all \nleaned over him, inspecting their prize. I swear Ananya was licking her lips. \nWhen I reached them they all turned to stare at the blades in my hand, and \none by one they took whichever knife spoke to them. I ended up with a \nvegetable knife, one of the smaller ones, but wickedly sharp. I can show it to \nyou if you like. \nWe all stared at each other for a long few seconds, waiting, like there was \ngoing to be some invisible signal. And apparently there was, because all at \nonce we descended, stabbing and slicing and carving and cutting, blood \ndripping and spraying up in tiny bursts as our knives worked on him. I don’t \nknow exactly when he died. Maybe he was dead already when his head hit the \ntable. \nIt doesn’t matter. It makes no difference to what happened. \nAnd when it was over, we just stood there, satisfied, basking in what we’d \ndone. Like the warm glow of an approving parent, tinged with a bloody \nsweetness. Or the feeling after a heavy but delicious meal, where you want \nnothing more than to sit and enjoy how full you feel. When Andrew suggested \nhe get rid of the body, no-one thought to object. He and Jamie dragged it out, I \nassume to his car, and that was that. I guess they must have gotten rid of it. \nThe police certainly haven’t come round asking about a corpse. Not that I’d \nknow if they had, I guess.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 2, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 4097}}
