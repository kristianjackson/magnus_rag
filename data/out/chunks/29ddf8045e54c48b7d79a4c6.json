Gerard studied it for some time, \nbut did not touch it. Finally, he nodded and offered to buy it from me for five \nthousand pounds. I almost laughed when he said that. I would have sold it for a \nfraction of the amount. I might even have given it away, if it wasn’t for the \nfeeling that that… wouldn’t count somehow. It’s hard to explain. I didn’t care \nwhat he planned to do with it, I just wanted to get rid of it, and so I agreed. \nGerard didn’t seem exactly happy at the news. He just nodded gravely and \nheaded towards the door, saying he’d need to get the money and return. I \ndidn’t try to stop him. He left, closing the door behind him and I was alone \nonce again. The whole encounter lasted barely more than a minute. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG004 – Page Turner \n13 \n \nI sat there, waiting in silence for him to return. It was awful, and I needed to \nfind some way to distract myself from the creeping smell, so I decided to get \nout my computer and see what I \ncould find out about Gerard and Mary Keay. Typing in their names I don’t know \nwhat sort of thing it was that I expected to find, but it certainly wasn’t a news \narticle from 2008 about Mary Keay’s murder. Police had broken in late \nSeptember, after neighbours complained about the \nsmell, and found her lying dead in the study. Cause of death was apparently \ndetermined to be an overdose of painkillers, but it was judged a murder due to \n“extensive post-mortem mutilation of the body”. Large pieces of her skin had \nbeen peeled away, and hung up to dry on fishing wire, allaround the room. The \narticle had a picture of Mary Keay, and there was no question that it was the \nsame old woman that I had met in Morden, although in the photograph she \nseemed to have a full head of hair and lacked any visible tattoos. \nI frantically started searching for any other information I could find. Other \nnews stories covered Gerard’s trial for his mother’s murder. Apparently he had \nbeen acquitted after a significant piece of evidence was deemed inadmissible, \nalthough none of the reports seemed to know what exactly that evidence was. \nIt was at this moment the knocking came again. Gerard had returned. \nI opened the door. I thought briefly about not letting him in, but I knew he’d \nwait there as long as he needed to, and I couldn’t think for the reek of ozone \nthat penetrated every one of my senses. I could not hide the terror on my face \nas he entered, but if he noticed the change in my demeanour then he didn’t \nreact to it. He simply handed me an envelope filled with cash. I didn’t even \nbother to count it before handing him the book. He looked at the title, then \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG004 – Page Turner \n14 \n \nflicked through it very quickly, before laughing, just once and nodding, \napparently to himself, as though he’d just come to some sort of decision. \nI had expected Gerard to leave immediately, but instead he walked over to my \nmetal waste paper basket and placed the book inside. He reached into his \njacket pocket, and pulled out a bottle of lighter fluid and a box of matches. \nWithin a few seconds the book was ablaze, and the smell vanished almost \nimmediately. Even as my head began to clear, I felt like I had to ask him why, \nbut he just shook his head. \n“My mother doesn’t always know what’s best for our family.” That was all he \nsaid before picking up the waste paper bin, now full of gently smouldering \nashes. I warned him it would be too hot to hold, but he shrugged and said he’d \nhad worse. Then Gerard Keay left, and I never saw him or the book again. \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nStatement ends. \nIf I never hear the name Jurgen Leitner again it will be too soon. I suppose it \nwas too much to hope that we’d finally dealt with all that remained of his \nlibrary after the incident in 1994, but it would have been useful if Gertrude had \nat least thought to add this statement to the current project file. Who knows \nhow many other statements are in here that might deal with his books or other \ncurrently active Institute projects? If my luck thus far is anything to go by, then \nI’d say it is unlikely this was an isolated example. The more I discover about \nthis archive, the more it seems Gertrude simply took the written statements \nand threw them into these files without even reading them.
