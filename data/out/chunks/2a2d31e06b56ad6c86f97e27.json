I’ve been thinking. It’s not like you got this \nwhole all-seeing thing recently; you’ve had it the whole time. I remember the \nway you looked at Sasha after the attack. You knew it wasn’t her. And I reckon \nyou knew Prentiss was lurking under the Institute too. And you did nothing. \nWhy? \n \n… \n \n(Shouting) Why? \n \nELIAS \nLet’s just get this over with, shall we? \n \nMARTIN \nWhat, like with Melanie? Just that perfect bit of information to leave me a \nwreck? \n \nELIAS \nYes. \n \nMARTIN \nWell, I hope you’ve got something better than that pathetic dig at my feelings \nfor John. \n \nELIAS \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG118 – The Masquerade \n \n20 \n \nHm. It’s baffling really. Such loyalty to someone who, really, treats you very \nbadly. \n \nMARTIN \nIs that supposed to be, what, a... revelation? \n \nELIAS \n(Chuckles) You know, I really should have gone for that, found something that \nwould finally manage to shatter that precious image you have of him. But, as \nyou say, I am... very busy, at the moment. So, I suppose I’ll just have to go with \nwhat I had prepared. \n \nMARTIN \nDo it. \n \nELIAS \nYour mother. \n \n(Martin inhales) \n \nShe’s always been... difficult, hasn’t she? You take care of her for years – feed \nher, clean up after her – and now, with her condition degrading even further, \nshe is the one that asked to move into a home, to have it left to the nurses. \nShe’s the one that refuses your visits. \n \nMARTIN \nShe’s always been— \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG118 – The Masquerade \n \n21 \n \n \nELIAS \nStrong-willed? Stubborn? No. No, Martin, you know the reason. \n \n… \n \nYour mother simply hates you. You just don’t know why. \n \n(Martin tries to keep his breathing steady) \n \nIt’s not your fault, though I know that isn’t any consolation. It’s just bad luck, \nreally. How old were you when your father left? Eight? Nine? When your \nmother began to sicken and he decided he was done with you both? Not old \nenough to remember him with any great clarity, especially when your mother \nrefused to keep any pictures of him. She never recovered from that betrayal. \nHe just tore her heart right out and took it with him. The thing is, though, \nMartin, if you ever do want to know exactly what your father looked like... all \nyou have to do is look in a mirror. \n \n(Martin emits small noise of despair) \n \nThe resemblance is quite uncanny. The face of the man she hates, who \ndestroyed her life, watching over her, feeding her, cleaning her, looking down \non her with such pity— \n \nMARTIN \nShut up! \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG118 – The Masquerade \n \n22 \n \n \nELIAS \nDo you want to know what she sees when she looks at you? \n \n(The tape hisses and Martin begins to weep. He takes shuddering breaths \nbefore finally collapsing to the floor, weeping. Elias just watches) \n \nDon’t burn any more statements. \n \n(Door closes, then reopens) \n \nMARTIN \nDid you find anything? \n \nMELANIE \nYes, I fou— Jesus, are you okay? \n \nMARTIN \nDo we have what we need? \n \nMELANIE \nI think so, yes. He didn’t even have a safe, just a few locked drawers. It was \neasy. \n \nMARTIN \nWe, we need to leave. \n \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG118 – The Masquerade \n \n23 \n \nMELANIE \nWe need to kill him. Look at you. He needs to die. \n \nMARTIN \nNo. No, I knew... I knew what this was going to be. \n \nMELANIE \nIt’s not just for you. If we leave him alive— \n \nMARTIN \n(Softly) Melanie, Melanie please. \n \nMELANIE \n(reluctantly) Alright. Let’s get these somewhere safe. \n \n(Click) \n \n(Click) \n \n(The singing and calliope is muffled) \n \nBASIRA \nSo, what do we do? \n \nARCHIVIST \nWe can’t help them. \n \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG118 – The Masquerade \n \n24 \n \nTIM \nWhat, so we’re just going to leave them to be skinned alive? \n \nARCHIVIST \nWell what do you want me to do? \n \nTIM \nYou brought me in as a distraction, right? Let me do it. Go in; maybe you can \nget some of them out. \n \nARCHIVIST \nTim, contrary to what you think, I did not bring you here to indulge your death \nwish! \n \nTIM \nThat’s not what this is! \n \nARCHIVIST \nNo? \n \nTIM \nNo. You knew I might not be coming back. \n \nARCHIVIST \nI knew none of us might be coming back, but I’m not going to let anyone get \nkilled for nothing!", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 3, "chunk_count": 5, "chars": 4256}}
