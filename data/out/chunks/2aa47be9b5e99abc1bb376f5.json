On all of them, the fur or feathers had been burned away, \nand all that was left was their skin, scalded a vivid, angry red, like they’d been \nbadly sunburned. They were dead, every one of them, though none seemed to \nhave decayed any more than their compatriots. Either they had all died \ntogether, or something in that place was keeping them fresh. Neither option \nsounded grand to me. \nFinally, I looked at the trees. There was nothing wrong with the trees \nthemselves, not exactly. Driven into the trunk of each one was a heavy-looking \niron nail. I didn’t count how many there were in total, maybe a couple dozen. \nEach suspended a worn and dirt-caked glass milk bottle that had clearly seen \nbetter days. My eyes fell on the string used to suspend them, and I couldn’t \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG037 – Burnt Offering \n8 \n \nhelp but notice it seemed far cleaner and newer than the bottles or their \ncontents. \nWhat was inside each one seemed to vary, some had pine needles and twigs, \nsome were full of dirt, and one or two even held what appeared to be \nrainwater, though looking closer I could see that it bubbled very gently inside \nthose bottles in an endless simmer. In each I could also see a small \nphotograph, half-buried in dirt or almost boiled clean. They all looked to be the \nsame photograph, though it was hard to tell for sure. An old woman, probably \nin her fifties or sixties, wearing reading glasses and grey hair curled into a tight \nbun. She stared out disapprovingly from every bottle. \nWeirdest of all, on the bottom of each was tied a lock of hair. It was long and \ngrey, in poor condition, and I reckon it must have belonged to the woman in \nthe photograph. It was tied up with the same new string as held the bottles, \nexcept for the fact that it was burned, ever so slightly at the ends. \nI was still in quite a lot of pain from the water earlier, but I’ve always been too \ncurious for my own stupid good. I took a few pictures on my phone, but I \nwanted some clear shots of the photograph inside to show my friends. God \nknows I should have just left; it’s not like there weren’t plenty of warning signs. \nI just chose not to pay attention. I picked up one of jars filled with twigs and \ntook it off the nail, trying to angle it in my hand to get a better shot of the \ncontents. \nThen my fingers slipped and I dropped it. I watched it plummet towards the \nhard winter ground, willing it not to shatter, not to break. It was falling so \nslowly, but I was even slower. It exploded into a thousand glass shards and \ninstantly I knew that I had meddled with something I should have left alone. I \nturned tail and ran, stopping only to reach down and pick up the photograph. I \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG037 – Burnt Offering \n9 \n \ndon’t know why, I suppose it felt so weird all of a sudden that I didn’t think I \ncould get any more cursed. And I wanted a copy of that picture just to prove to \nmyself that what I had found was real. It was real. You can have the damn \nthing now, though. I’ll leave it with my statement. I know in my heart getting \nrid of it will make no difference but I have to try. \nBecause from that moment on, everything I love and value has burned or been \ndestroyed. My car overheated on the way back to the Forestry Commission, \nand I barely got out before the engine caught fire. My house was a \nsmouldering heap of blackened rubble before the end of the week.

And I cannot \nlose him. I can’t lose Ethan. I shouldn’t be in this mess. It’s absurd. I didn’t do \nanything wrong. I just dropped a bottle. That’s all! I don’t deserve this. I don’t. \nI asked about who might have gone to the area, but aside from some middle-\naged businessmen on a hiking trip no-one’s been anywhere near that clearing \nfor years. There is no reason this is happening, but I’m still going to lose \neverything. I am so scared. \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nStatement ends. \nHe didn’t, in the end. Lose Ethan, that is.
