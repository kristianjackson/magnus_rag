Major injuries scar up fast. You \ncan force the truth out of people and knowledge pops into your head \nwhenever you need it. \nARCHIVIST \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 127 – Remains to be Seen \n \n12 \n \nYes. I, I think that, that about covers it. \nBASIRA \nAnd what was that you were doing yesterday? \nARCHIVIST \nWhen? \nBASIRA \nYou were sat on the floor for like four hours. \nARCHIVIST \nOh. No, I was, uh, I was… listening. You know, trying to see if any of the \nstatements... called to me. \nBASIRA \nAnd? \n[Paper rustles] \nBrilliant. \nARCHIVIST \nLook, I don’t know, Basira. I hope I’m still human, but it— but it’s seeming \nmore and more unlikely. \nBASIRA \nI didn’t ask. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 127 – Remains to be Seen \n \n13 \n \nARCHIVIST \nNo, I suppose you didn’t. \nBASIRA \nDon’t snoop in my head. \nARCHIVIST \nI’m not snooping! I’m not looking! That’s not how this works. \nBASIRA \n(Sharply) Explain it, then. \nARCHIVIST \nI’m not sure I can. \nBASIRA \nHumour me. \n[Deep sighs] \nARCHIVIST \nIt’s... hard. It’s like there’s a, a door, in my mind, and behind it is, is the entire \nocean. Before, I didn’t notice it, but now I, I know it’s there and I can’t forget it \nand I can feel the pressure of the water on it. I, I, I can keep it closed, but \nsometimes when I’m around people or places or… ideas, a drop or two will \npush through the cracks at the edges of the door. And I’ll Know something. \n \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 127 – Remains to be Seen \n \n14 \n \nBASIRA \nWhat happens if you open the door? \nARCHIVIST \nI drown. \n… \nLook, I’m sorry, Basira. I, I will try to keep anything I learn about you to myself. \nMy priorities haven’t changed. I hope you can believe that. I’m still on your \nside. You can trust me. \nBASIRA \nYeah, people keep saying that. \nARCHIVIST \nDo they? Wh-who else? Did Martin say something? \nBASIRA \nIt was a few months back, after the attack. He’d started spending time with \nLukas, at least he said he was, and I wanted answers. He kept telling me to \ntrust him, to hear the guy out even though he still wouldn’t actually show his \nface. I told him he could drop me an email or vanish me. \nARCHIVIST \nRight. \nBASIRA \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 127 – Remains to be Seen \n \n15 \n \nHonestly, I kind of regret not just grabbing Martin and shaking an explanation \nout of him. But I didn’t want to push it. He was in a bad place, what with the \nattack and his mum and everything. So, I didn’t press it. Now I try and bring it \nup, he just disappears. Nothing to be done. \nARCHIVIST \nS-Sorry, you said— What happened with his mother? \nBASIRA \nOh, yeah. She died. About two months after you, uh... Martin was— He tried to \nstay strong, keep it together, but that sort of thing... Then those Flesh things \nburst in and, well, here we are. \nARCHIVIST \nGod. \nBASIRA \nHe didn’t tell you? \nARCHIVIST \nNo. \nBASIRA \nHmm. Guess you don’t know everything, then. \nARCHIVIST \nNo, I-I guess not. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 127 – Remains to be Seen \n \n16 \n \nSo, what do we do now? \nBASIRA \nYou tell me. Just don’t expect much on trust these days. \nARCHIVIST \nYes, I… I suppose that's fair. \n[Tape clicks off. Tape clicks on. Faint sounds of prison, growing briefly louder \nas a heavy door is unlocked and opened, then closed.] \nELIAS \nGood evening... Detective. \nBASIRA \nI’m not a detective. \nELIAS \nOf course. \nBASIRA \nYou wanted to see me? \nELIAS \nYes. \nBASIRA \nSomething ‘too important’ to tell the Inspector? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 127 – Remains to be Seen \n \n17 \n \nELIAS \nMaybe I just wanted to have a chat. \nBASIRA \nWell, good luck with that. \n[Rattling of chain and handcuffs] \nELIAS \nI found one of these in my cell. It wasn’t recording, but I assume this means \nhe’s awake. \nBasira? \nBASIRA \nCan we cut the bullshit? \nELIAS \nWhat bullshit might that be? \nBASIRA \nThe part where you pretend you don’t spend your whole time watching us? \nELIAS \nSometimes I’m eating. \nBASIRA \nYou know he’s back. You’ve seen him.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 4, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 3941}}
