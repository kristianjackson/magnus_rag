I can’t make people actually \nunderstand how horridly, nauseatingly boundless this universe is, and when I \nthink of it too deeply I feel like I’m going to throw up, like a sort of existential \nvertigo. \n \nIt never used to scare me like this. I used to take a sort of comfort in it, in the \nthought that we were so small, such a minor blip in the life of the universe. \nWhere others saw insignificance and pointlessness, I found freedom. A sort of \noptimistic nihilism, I suppose? I know now it was all just denial, of course. It’s \nnot easy to be scared of something that you can’t even think about. I miss \nthose days, smoking out the window of a tower block, looking over the lights of \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG106 ‘A Matter of Perspective’ \n \n3 \n \nthe city blinking up in defiance of the void, and thinking how daft it was, like an \nant shaking its fist at a god. I think that’s really why I wanted to go to space: to \nput it all in perspective, that for one moment I could look down and see it all. \nEvery human that ever existed, the living and the dead, hanging below me on a \ntidy ball of carbon. \n \nAnd do you know what? It was worth it. At least I thought so at the time. That \nmoment, that first look at the Earth falling away below us … it was everything I \ndreamed it would be. And how often is that true? The Daedalus was in low \nenough orbit that I never got the whole planet view as I had hoped, but it \ndidn’t matter, the first time looking down and taking in the sheer scale of it \nremains the most magnificent sensation I have ever experienced. \n \nI don’t know how they picked me for the mission. A representative of some \nprivate consortium approached me about a year beforehand. I’d put in my \napplication a few times, but I never really expected anything. I had all the skills, \nbut I knew I wasn’t anyone’s first choice of astronaut. I simply wasn’t \nexceptional enough, or so I thought. Mr Fairchild didn’t mention exactly why I \nwas chosen, though he did reference my psychiatric profile a few times in the \ninterview, and I didn’t want to press him too hard on the reason in case I \nsomehow lost the opportunity. Idiot. \n \nThere were technically three of us up there, although I only really spent any \ntime with Manuela. The other one who came up with us – Chilcott, I think his \nname was – he was apparently doing some sort of separate isolation study. \nCan’t say I envied him. The door to his section of the station was daunting, to \nsay the least. I mean, I’m an engineer and honestly it looked like it was sturdier \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG106 ‘A Matter of Perspective’ \n \n4 \n \nthan the actual hull. Manuela and I were instructed not to attempt any \ncommunication with him, and to be honest that was fine by me. On those \noccasions we had to call into his little chamber through the intercom, usually \nas part of maintenance or a systems’ check, he always sounded so distant. This \nflat, tinny monotone that set my teeth on edge like a subtle vibration. So, we \nleft him to it. \n \nWe had plenty of our own work to do, anyway. Manuela Dominguez was quite \na big name in certain areas of the physics community. Or at least, she had \nbeen. I hadn’t heard of any work she’d done for a good few years, but as I say, \nI’m more on the engineering side of things, so it wasn’t something I kept up \nwith in detail. While she was happy to talk, Manuela apparently didn’t like to \ndiscuss her professional life on Earth, or the specifics of the research she was \ndoing on the Daedalus. Like Chilcott, her research was kept entirely separate \nfrom mine and, while we spent plenty of time together, I never did figure out \nexactly what it was. Something to do with lasers, I think. \n \nAs for my job, to be honest it felt disappointingly like busy work: stress testing, \nzero gravity effects, material evaluations. For every test I was told to do, I \ncould have listed a half-dozen studies citing similar research from the ISS, most \nof which had had pretty conclusive results. If you had told me I was just being \ninstructed to do the same things they did over there, but two years later, I’d \nhave been hard pressed to argue. \n \nBut there was something else. A different sort of worry that was building up \ninside me. It was like a gradual increase of air pressure. You never notice it \nhappening until your ears pop.
