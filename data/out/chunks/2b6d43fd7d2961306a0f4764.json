So… so delicate, so forgetful, yet gently wise. He cared for \nher. He trusted her. And she fed him to me. She made him me to destroy our \ntranscendence. And she did not hesitate. \nPoor Michael. He had been on trips for the Institute before. Conferences, \ninvestigations, Gertrude had made sure that all her assistants were ready. That \nnone of them would be suspicious if they were told they were going abroad for \nwork. So, there was no doubt in his mind, no concern, when she told him that \nthey were travelling to Russia. Perhaps if he’d have stopped to look up their \ndestination, he might have discovered there was no such place as Zemlya \n\nSannikova, but he did not. He trusted her. \nEven when they arrived in Dikson, at the edge of the Kara Sea, and they were \npicked up by a quiet sea captain called Peter Lukas… Even then he trusted her. \nThey travelled north, through cold far more bitter than any Michael had even \nconceived possible. And do you know what he worried about? (Laughs) He… \nworried about Gertrude Robinson. About how this poor old woman might cope \nwith the chill. But now she was like iron, and walked with a purpose that \nMichael had never before seen in her. The water turned to ice as the Arctic \napproached, and Gertrude’s eyes turned cold. \nThen, at last, he began to be afraid. He asked her where they were going and \nwas told again: Zemlya Sannikova. Sannikov Land. There was a great evil, she \nsaid, and Michael was going to help her fight it. Am I evil, Archivist? Is a thing \nevil when it simply obeys its own nature? When it embodies its nature? When \nthat nature is created by those which revile it? Perhaps Gertrude believed so. \nMichael certainly did. He believed everything she told him. \nAnd it was me they sought to stop. Me and the others of It-Is-Not-What-It-Is. \nOur Great Twisting. The-Worker-of-Clay had laboured for decades on that \ncontorted, impossible edifice of doors… and stairs… and falsehoods… and \nsmiles. A thousand staring morsels stood, and not one of them believed \nthemselves sane to look upon it. And in the centre, the door that would open \nto all the places that were never there, was me. I use the word ‘apotheosis’ not \nbecause it is correct, but because I can only show you its truth when we are \nwithin the passages themselves. \nAnd this is what Michael and Gertrude found when they set foot on Sannikov \nLand, which does not exist and never has. It was warm, and feeling its \n\nreassurance beneath his feet was the last time poor, doomed Michael knew \ncomfort. They walked through the green jungle of that forever-elusive polar \nisland, and up the gentle mountains that can never have a name. And at the \ntop, they found us through our spiralling laughter. And they saw us in all of our \nglory. \nMichael did not go mad, though no words you could have said would have \nconvinced him otherwise. The mind does not shatter, Archivist. It is soft and \nmalleable. It bends and twists and returns to what it was, though what you see \nand feel may leave their mark upon it. If Michael thought he had lost his mind, \nit was only because what he saw with crystal clarity was simply not something \nthat could be real. \nBut Gertrude Robinson did not waver. She did not… hesitate. She gave no \nindication that she saw anything more or less than was expected. Hers was not \na mind that left room for doubt. She stared into us carefully, her eyes scanning \nfor something that was my heart. Looking for my door. And she found it. \nPerhaps I should have realised what was happening; seen those two lonely \nfigures approaching me, but I cannot tell you the existential joys of truly… \nbecoming. Of an entireness finally crossing the threshold into your self. So \necstatic was my completeness, I did not even hear my own door creak open. \nBecause Gertrude had told Michael how he could stop us. She told him to walk \nthrough a door. And even then, with so much of his mind shut down in panic \nand terror, he trusted her. And he went inside, closing the door behind him. \nBut Gertrude Robinson had given poor, disposable Michael one more thing \nbefore sending him to me. She had given him a map. I couldn’t say how she \nwould have gotten such a thing, or if she somehow made it. And yet it was a", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 2, "chunk_count": 5, "chars": 4300}}
