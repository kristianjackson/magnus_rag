I won’t let my son burn, even if you cowards don’t have the \nguts to step up and do something. \nI’m sorry. I know. There’s no-one to blame by my own stupid self. Blundering in \nwhere I had no right to go. But yes, I know, you want the whole goddamn \nstory, don’t you? So you can look over it in ten years and go “Hmm, \ninteresting” long after Ethan and me are dead. Well, fine. There’s not much to \nit, really. For everything it’s done to me, I didn’t really do anything at all. Just \nmessed around in the wrong clearing. \nI’m an ecologist. Was an ecologist. Working for the Forestry Commission up in \nScotland. It was a great job. For me, at least. I suppose if you don’t like hiking \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG037 – Burnt Offering \n5 \n \nor being alone you’d have a hard time with it, but for me it was a great fit. \nNow, up in the north of Scotland, the bit without all the people, there are \nplantations of evergreen trees. Huge ones. And their job is the same as pretty \nmuch any other tree – to get cut down for wood. Trouble is, a lot of animals \nmake their homes in and around those trees. Badgers, red squirrels, even pine \nmartens. Do you know what a pine marten is? It’s a wee bear. An adorable wee \nbear that needs to be protected. Because the pine marten, like a lot of other \nspecies that live in those areas, is protected by conservation laws; can’t be \nlegally killed without the sort of special permissions logging companies rarely \nhave. So it was my job to walk through all these plantations with a clipboard \nand note down what animals had made their homes where. \nYou don’t need me to tell you that the job can me a long way from civilisation \nat times. Some of these plantations are… off the beaten track. Everyone gets \nso caught up on how small Scotland is compared to other countries, but it’s \nstill huge compared to a single idiot wandering through the forests. And there \naren’t so many people, so you have large areas all but devoid of human life. It \nwasn’t uncommon for me to find myself an hour or more away from a town or \nmain road or any other human life at all. I didn’t mind being alone, though, \nbecause I knew I had my little boy Ethan waiting for me back at home. Four \nyears old and already sharp as anything. And my wife Lucy. She used to be \nwaiting for me as well. \nYou see… plenty of strange things out here. That far from anywhere, a lot of \nfolks use it as their own personal dumping grounds. Fridges, microwaves, \nbarbed wire, all sorts. Occasionally strewn throughout the forests and over the \nhills. I even found a corpse once. Not as exciting as it sounds – they were far \ntoo decomposed for me to tell anything about the death. Could have been a", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 1, "chunk_count": 5, "chars": 2711}}
