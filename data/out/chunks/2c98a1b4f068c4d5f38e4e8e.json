If it worked, I would listen to her walk off to \nher room, and then bring out my book once again. At the time I thought it was \nbecause I loved reading, but looking back I think it must have been the first \nstirrings of insomnia. \nThere is a billboard outside my flat. It overlooks a small roundabout and used \nto have adverts for whatever the latest TV drama was. The metal that holds it \nup is old and rusted, and sometimes I think I can hear it groaning ever so \nquietly as I walk past. Now it has an advert for coffee. I assume that is what it’s \nadvertising. It’s a woman, bright and cheerful, with a sky-blue blouse and \nshining white smile. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG074 – Fatigue \n3 \n \nShe holds a cup of coffee, the steam rising and curling in front of her eyes. \nThere is no brand name or information, just the words, “Sleep is overrated” in \na tall, thin font. I don’t know how long it has been there. Her eyes seem to look \nin through my window. \nI work as a freelance writer. It’s not a good job. Very little of it actually involves \nwriting, the rest is chasing up invoices, desperately firing off pitches and \nworrying over a budget spreadsheet that doesn’t add up. I always thought it \nsuited my schedule, allowing me to be flexible, but it has in many ways just \nrobbed me of any connection to the way the rest of the world organises itself. I \nnever know what day of the week it is. When I don’t sleep the days and nights \njust bleed together. Sometimes it feels that even my clock is lying to me, telling \nme that an hour lasts so much longer than it should, then stealing an entire \nmorning in the blink of an eye. \nThere is a man in my living room. He is tall, with sandy blond hair that twists \ninto unruly curls. I must have invited him in. He sits in my armchair, drumming \nhis fingers together. They make an odd, clacking sound when they touch. I \nknow him, though I have no idea where we might have met. His smile is \nfriendly but I don’t like it. I apologise, tell him I’ve forgotten his name and he \nwaves it away, saying that names are overrated, then asks how my day has \nbeen. I tell him I don’t know which day he means, and he laughs and laughs \nand laughs until my nose begins to bleed. I see the blood dripping onto the \npatterns I have been drawing. How long have I been drawing? It isn’t my pen. \nWhat’s the longest you’ve ever stayed awake? As a student I liked to push \nmyself, conduct little experiments on my own capacity for fatigue, time how \nmany hours and then try to beat my record. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG074 – Fatigue \n4 \n \nAfter a while I stopped counting, though for some reason I never really \nstopped thinking of them as experiments. At first I tried to convince friends to \nstay up with me. Sometimes they would but they never lasted more than forty \nhours, and I always felt too awkward to stay up after they had crashed. \nEventually I began just doing it alone, relishing the feeling that I had somehow \nseen beyond what they were able to. \nI’m sitting in a cafe. It’s open all night and I go there when I’m feeling restless \nlate at night. I try to imagine I’m sitting in Hopper’s “Nighthawks at the Diner”, \nbut there is a thin layer of grease on the plastic tables that dispels any \nromanticism about the place. I’m drinking a cup of coffee. The coffee is awful, \nthe cheapest instant that money can buy wholesale. I don’t care. It is black and \nopaque and when I drink it, I can feel the tiniest bit of life seep through me as \nthe caffeine enters my blood. I take a long sip and stop. The coffee has \nsomething in it. Smooth and hard. I spit it onto the table. It’s a tooth. I check, \nbut I am not missing any. It’s small, like a child’s milk tooth, and it just sits \nthere. The waitress comes over to see if I want food, even though I never do. \nHer name tag reads “Vanessa”. I point to the shiny white lump now lying on \nthe table. I don’t think she sees it, and if she does, she does not react. \nShe goes to get me more coffee. \nYour vision goes strange when you don’t sleep for a long time. I think it’s \nsomething to do with changing pressure on your eyeballs. You start to detect \nfaint movements on the edges, on the periphery, and if you stare too long at a \nflat surface it starts to gently pulse and move.
