Poor Fiona never suspected \na thing. \nDecades this went on, until Fiona was old and tired. There was less chaos back \nthen. Gertrude's war was still only kindling and years might go by without \nanything terrible brushing against the Institute. \nBut at last, they found a coffin. And it was not a place that could be escaped by \nfleeing or by fainting. When Emma came to tell Gertrude what had happened, \nshe found the first of the cobwebs in her hair, the ones she would wash from it \nevery morning for the rest of her life. And Gertrude mourned the first of many \nlosses, and did not suspect the truth. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 167 – Curiosity \n13 \nEventually, Fiona was replaced by a young man named Michael. Far too young \nto have such a job, really, but… things were different in those days. He was \nkeen and eager, and Emma had a, slightly different idea of how to test him. \nShe never really touched Eric, of course. He had been marked early by another \nwho Emma was… keen not to cross. But young Michael? So innocent, so naive? \nShe decided to experiment with how long she could keep him in the dark as to \nwhat was really going on. As it turns out, all his life. This time, Gertrude did \nhave an inkling as to what was happening, but had her own escalating conflicts \nto concern herself with, and recognized the potential in a truly ignorant \nassistant. \nAt some point Eric disappeared. It's interesting the places that Gertrude did \nand did not think to look for him. She scoured the most warped and darkened \ncorners of London, expecting any moment to find his remains. But she took \nMary at her word when she said she hadn't seen him. She could have known \nthe truth, of course, if she had wished but, it was so much easier to make it \nanother pillar of her crusade. Emma knew what had happened, but had no \ninterest in sharing such details. \nEric was replaced by another assistant, not so young as Michael, and hardened \nwith some encounters of her own. She was eager to prove herself, and exactly \nthe sort of person to intrigue the aging Emma. There was a fire to Sarah \nCarpenter, perhaps the one which led to Gertrude hiring her, and Emma's \ncuriosity ignited once again, this time keen to find out exactly what it would \ntake to break this brave investigator of the unknown. \nBy this point Gertrude was fully lost to her plots and plans and struggles, and \nas long as her assistants played their parts when asked, she paid them no more \nmind. And the frequency of genuine encounters grew as the season of hurried \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 167 – Curiosity \n14 \nrituals came nearer. It wasn't hard for Emma to convince her younger \ncolleague to take the lead in their inquiries. \nShe took Sarah to a cave and sent her deep inside to see how far it went. There \nwas no end, and the darkness was deeper than an absence of light would \nallow, but Sarah held firm to her cable, and Emma was gracious enough to pull \nher back into the light. \nShe took Sarah to the woods with a strange book of astronomy and suggested \nshe go and chart the stars. The brave stargazer stayed beneath the canopy, \nand never quite lost herself to the cosmos, though sometimes when Emma \nlooked into her eyes she could still see a reflection of uncanny constellations. \nShe even convinced Sarah to stay inside an old man's house, desperate to see \nher eaten by a hungry door, but was again disappointed. And all through it \nGertrude could not see what was happening. And certainly the Spider \nsmoothed things, elided questions, wiped away evidence, but it barely had to. \nFar better to feed Gertrude a steady string of plans to foil and rituals to derail. \nSarah's luck ran out when Gertrude and Michael were away on that last trip to \na frozen island that did not exist. Emma had been given the statement of a \nwidow whose life and home and partner had been taken by a man who, as she \nput it, ‘burned on the inside’. And so Sarah and her secret tormentor went \nlooking for this being, and they found him standing in the smoking ruin of an \nold farmhouse. \nHe was bald, dressed in dreary office clothes. To a cursory examination, unfit \nand unremarkable, save for his peculiar surroundings. If they had paused and \nlooked closer, Emma might have seen the drizzling rain rising as steam from his \nskin.
