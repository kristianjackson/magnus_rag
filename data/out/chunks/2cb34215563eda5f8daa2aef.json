Even the tears \nthat Leto sheds in grief will fall and drown his friends. He holds his arms in \nclose and tries not to move. \n[Earth shifts and crumbles, and there are footsteps] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nThere is someone else here now, someone shouting at him. The voice, it is the \none who was screaming in the tunnels. He is still screaming, yelling something \nat Leto. Blood drips from all over him, matted into his hair, crusting his lips \nwith red. \n[Footsteps turn into stamping] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nHe flails his arms wildly and stamps his feet, pulping a mass of ants, ending \ntheir lives with such a cruel and callous disregard that Leto is filled with a \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 184 – Like Ants \n6 \nsudden rage. His limbs are willed with an energy they have not known in an \nage as he lunges at the awful murderer. \n[Footstep and movement] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nJordan sees the crying man coming, face twisted in some bone-deep hatred as \nhe lunges at him. The relief he had felt, the momentary elation of seeing \nanother human face in this dreadful labyrinth evaporates in an instance, \nreplaced by the sick familiarity and bitter déjà vu of a cycle repeating itself \nonce again. \n[Sounds of squishing and dirt; a wave of ant noises] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nHe steps to the side, almost falling, feeling the bite of more ants as he pushes \ninto a mass of them on the wall of the small chamber. \nThe man who charged him lets out a noise of terrible realisation as he \noverbalances and topples forward, his whole body slamming into the dark \ninsectile carpet that covers the floor. \n[Body collapses amidst earth and shifting forms] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nThe impact is heavy, and then he lies still. \nHe can feel them below him. The dead and the dying, murdered by Leto’s \nclumsiness, his rash and destructive rage. The fear he felt as he was falling has \nbeen replaced by a sick dread of standing back up, of seeing the destruction his \nfall has wrought upon those that trusted him. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 184 – Like Ants \n7 \n[Sporadic footsteps] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nThe other man, that bloody omen of doom, is talking again, ranting, spewing \nnonsense about a queen, about finding her, about killing her. Leto struggles \nnot to laugh; the words rattle around his mind in hollow recognition. There is \nno queen, he knows that. There is no single will to command the wondrous \nexpanse of crawling lives. Each and every one is their own, and together they \nare so much more. He says as much to the interloper, preparing as he does so \nto stand, but before he can he feels the tell-tale tickle of his friends moving \nover him, covering him. He cannot rise, cannot lift himself without killing them. \nHe begs them to save themselves, to let him up, but they will not understand \nhis words. \n[Footsteps] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nJordan leaves the man to his despair, the words rattling around in his head. No \nqueen. He knows that of course, but sometimes he allows himself the smallest \nflicker of hope that maybe there is a heart to this place, some core chamber \nwhere the bloated insectile monarch might sit, vulnerable and waiting. \nBut no, it is all the same, just the endless maze and ants and tunnels, \nunnumbered minds, meaningless in themselves, but together a being that \ndwarfs him, that if it wished to end his suffering could do so without a gesture. \nHe turns the wrong corner, and the ants are upon him once again. \n[A rumbling wave of ants that fades] \n(Hissing static starts] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 184 – Like Ants \n8 \n[The sounds of ants continue, but less overwhelming] \n(Hissing static ends] \nMARTIN \nUh, J-John, uh... \n(Heavy sigh) \nARCHIVIST \nAre you alright? \nMARTIN \nY-Y-Yeah. I-I mean, no, I just... \nARCHIVIST \nDon’t like ants? \nMARTIN \nObviously not. No-one likes ants, John. \nARCHIVIST \nAs the embodiment of all knowledge, I am not entirely sure that’s true but… \nokay.
