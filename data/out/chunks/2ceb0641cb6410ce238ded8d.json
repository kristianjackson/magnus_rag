As she spoke, I \ncouldn’t look away from her arm and the odd ways it twisted as she gestured. \nHow her fingers seemed to bend the wrong way. I was glad that Ruth had gone \nhome early as I didn’t want her to witness the disturbing confrontation I had \nnow apparently caused. \nWhen she had finished, Mrs. Hopworth spat towards me, though I noticed she \nwas careful to avoid spitting at the book that now lay on the floor between us, \nand left. I put down the copy of Stephen King’s Misery that I now realised I’d \nbeen clutching, and approached the discarded volume that lay on the carpet. \nThe battered black cover seemed the same as when I had first seen it weeks \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG017 – The Boneturner’s Tale \n9 \n \nago, with that faded white title on the front: The Boneturner’s Tale. I reached \ndown to pick it up, but before I did so a thought flashed across my mind, a \nmemory of the last time I had seen Jared, and I grabbed some tissues from the \ndesk before using them to pick up the book.
