This is \none of the reasons I am here, because I have this deep and gnawing fear that it \nportends nothing but itself, and within that there is some strangely awful fate \nwaiting for me. \n \nI have never been quite as social as I am told an actor should be. Rehearsals \nhave always been a professional thing for me and have rarely resulted in \nfriendships, and I actively avoid after-show drinks. It will perhaps not surprise \nyou to discover I instead prefer to walk the city, to find those streets and \nplaces where the night crowd does not gather, and wander those empty lights, \nclearing my head as I leave the heat and cloying conversation behind. In the \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG108 – Monologue \n \n5 \n \nsummer months, this ritual is almost a necessity for me to remain stable, my \nsteps taking me through the echoing streets and artificial lights – an edifice to \nhumanity, uncluttered by the messy existence of actual people. \n \nThe mask and cloak did not appear at the theatre the following night. I looked \nfor it, yet saw nothing but an audience of silhouettes, quiet and intent, save for \nwhen applause was required. It wasn’t my best performance, on edge as I was, \nbut I got through it. Afterwards, Patrick Dunlevey, who played Orlando, was \nmore insistent than usual that I join them for drinks after the show, and it look \nall my composure to keep my excuses polite, as the sticky heat of his presence \npressed though over the fading warmth of the stage lights and the high \nsummer that pervaded even the Duke of York. \n \nBut I did escape him, and fled into the cooling dampness of the city streets by \nnight. The streets which I knew were less likely to be populated were \nmercifully deserted, and the windows of the buildings either side were lit, but \nempty of anybody visible. My breathing began to slow, my steps became more \nsure, and the oppressive thickness of the air lessened just enough for me to \nrelax. I began to look up at all the darkened windows above street level. It is a \nstrange truth to realise that for all the throng of humanity that exists in central \nLondon, almost nobody actually lives there. The apartments and residences \nthat sit above the bustling shopfronts and businesses are almost all empty, \nbought as investments by the financiers and oligarchs who have no desire or \nneed to live in them. If you raise your eyes upwards in central London and \ncount the lit windows, it is not at all unusual to see none at all. \n \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG108 – Monologue \n \n6 \n \nBut that night, as I caught my breath and levelled my head, there was a lit \nwindow on the second floor. And within it, a masked mockery of a human \nfigure. \n \nMy face fell, until I had the odd certainty that my expression matched that of \nmy pursuer, and panic began to settle over my brain, pinprick crawling from \nthe back, inch by inch over my skull, and I knew that when it reached my eyes I \nwould run. The figure didn’t move. Of course it didn’t, there was nothing to it \nthat could move. No will that could make it follow me. And yet it still watched, \nits hollow, empty eyes drawing me into it. \n \nI ran for some time, through streets I knew should be humming with drunks \nand nighthawks and insomniacs, but they were all silent. I was alone. \nSometimes, when I turned a corner, at the far end I could see it, waiting for \nme, and I would turn away. Sometimes, when I looked over my shoulder, I \nwould see it there, following me with its stillness, its absence. Once I looked \nup, and the windows were full of it. I don’t know how long I ran, but in the end, \nI fell, physically spent and sunken in despair. Raising my head, I saw it before \nme, waiting. So I stood and began to walk slowly towards it. It gave no \nreaction, simply awaiting my arrival. \n \nAs I got closer, I saw it more clearly: the heavy weave of the black woolen \ncloak; the shining porcelain of the mask; the hollow empty space behind the \neyes, inside the mouth. I faced my demon, and there was nothing there. In a fit \nof sudden rage, I struck out, my arm catching it on the side of what should \nhave been a head, but the cloth crumbled beneath my blow, the mask fell, and", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 2, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 4213}}
