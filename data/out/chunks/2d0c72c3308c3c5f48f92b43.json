He laughed again, and told me, “No, sir, \nyou have nothing to fear from the dead.” \nAt these words I began to back away, ensuring my hand was on my pistol, not \ntaking my eyes off this strange man until I reached the edge of the mausoleum. \nOnly then did I look down to make sure my lantern was where I left it, and \nwhen I returned my gaze to the trees, he was gone. To speak plainly I was \nrather shaken by my encounter, and considered turning back and trying my \nluck another day, but something within me balked at having all my work and \npreparation be for naught because of a single farmer who couldn’t mind his \nbusiness. I lit my lantern, and… \nJONATHAN SIMS \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG023 – Schwartzwald \n8 \n \nMartin!

No monuments or coffins \nstood inside, and no plaques or sigils adorned the wall. Just a single slab of \nmarble stood in the centre, like an altar. At first I thought that perhaps that \nwas where the coffin should have sat, and someone had simply taken it, but as \nI walked around I saw what it was concealing. Behind the sharp-angled block \nwas a staircase, descending deep into some unknown subterranean vault. \nYou will scoff at me, Jonah, when next we meet, I am sure of it.

Any fear I may have had was \nsolely focused on the man I had met outside, and I foresaw no danger within \nthe vault itself. So I hoisted my lantern and I descended the stairs. \nThey were old, of that there is no doubt, but they were not worn, and I would \nwager that I was the first soul to go down there in at least a century. They \ndescended for some time, until I was quite certain that I was deep within the \nfrozen earth of the Schwarzwald. At last, the steps ended in a short corridor, \nand I could see the bricks that formed the walls and arched ceiling had \ncrumbled and shifted in places, allowing ingress to the thick roots of the trees \nabove, which coiled and splayed across those parts of the passage in most \nneed of repair.
