At that point, I had no idea what it was, but I would have \ndescribed it as not unlike wood. I tested the grate and found it came away \neasily from the floor, leaving a hole large enough to climb through without any \nproblems. \nI had taken to keeping a torch with me on my walks, as I sometimes had a \ntendency to wander too far and so I’d be walking back in the dark. Shining it \ninto the now open hole revealed what looked to be an old tunnel. Whether it \nwas manmade, a naturally occurring cave, or somewhere in between, I \ncouldn’t say, but it was easily big enough for me to walk down and, once again, \nI saw that glint of pale white a long way down. So I went in. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 053 - Crusader \n11 \n \nIt was slow going as my leg was still weak and the floor of the tunnel was not \nlevel. I had to crouch at points and place my hands upon the dusty walls for \nsupport. After a few minutes, I was deep enough that my torch was the only \nsource of light and the passage began to open up into what seemed to be a \nlarge room. \nIt was there, in a small alcove carved into the wall, that I saw what had caught \nthe light. It was an old papyrus scroll, lying amongst the shattered remnants of \nits case. I cast my torch around and saw more shelves carved into the walls of \nthe chamber, each of which housed a scroll of its own. They were written in a \nlanguage I didn’t recognise, but they were old and they smelt of age and dry \ndecay. \nIt wasn’t the only room like that. There were dozens of chambers like it, all of \ndifferent shapes and sizes, connected like a warren. Some were empty; others \nstill had a handful of old scrolls left in alcoves or fallen to the floor. It looked \nlike the place had been looted a long, long time ago. After checking through a \nfew rooms, I was sure that whatever this was, it must have been a huge \narchaeological find. I really didn’t know who to tell about it, but I knew I \nneeded to tell somebody. As I turned to head back towards the entrance, my \ntorch beam fell upon something dark in an adjoining room. It was a body. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 053 - Crusader \n12 \n \nFrom the looks of it, the corpse had been dead a long, long time and the dry air \nhad almost mummified it, leaving a desiccated skin stretched tight over the \nbony frame. It wore what looked to be the remains of chainmail and a black \ncloth tabard with a pointed white cross emblazoned on the chest. A broken \nsword lay nearby, now rusted almost into nothing, and as I gazed at the dead \nman’s face, I couldn’t stop a chill running down my spine. I tried to tell myself \nthat it was just the way the skull had warped over the years that made him \nlook like he was screaming. His eyes were gone, but rather than simply \ndecaying into nothingness, there were ragged scratches around the edges of \nthe sockets, leaving messy hollow pits. I was feeling very afraid now and had \njust turned around to leave when my torch abruptly turned off. \nIt was the strangest thing. It should have been pitch dark. There was no light at \nall filtering through into those underground caverns. But instead, I, I could see \neverything. Every detail of the shrivelled corpse before me was as clear as day, \nthough there was no light to see it. I, I can’t explain it, even really describe how \nit felt, but it was absolute darkness and I could still see. At the same time, I \nsuddenly got the most intense feeling of being watched, like a thousand eyes \nturned to me at once. \nI froze. From somewhere, deeper within that strange, ancient library, there \nwas the sound of movement – the rustling of cloth and a slow, rhythmic step", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 4, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 3671}}
