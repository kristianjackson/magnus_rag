Could you turn a thought and burn \nyour lead on your pursuers, an ankle change a charge now perpendicular to \nyour intended line of best retreat, and stake it all on one last hope, your \nbruised feet pounding to the edge? The boundary. Don't stop the ride. But you \nstill want to get off. \n \nBut no, for all the dreams of bounding, leaping off into the great unknown, you \nsee the ring of broken mewling wretches who have shown the sting that comes \nwith such rejection of the truth, so seldom spoken yet inside you all that there \nis no way off the merry-go-round. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 165 – Revolutions \n10 \n \nAnd so perhaps the twirling round that pushes all who passenger the carousel \nmight help you stay ahead, and so you seize the rough and peeling pole of \nancient wooden horse, ignore \nthe sloughing, screaming wood that comes away in clumps, and grip the saddle \nhard, in hands that should be clean but now have never seen a day they were \nnot caked \nin glue and slaked with blood of all the robberies existence deems the only way \nto live. \n \nRide away. Just ride away. \nUp it goes. Down it comes. \n \nHold fast to the joy of the rise. Despise all thoughts you might descend. \nAnd in the end, protest against that fall back down to painted wooden spinning \nearth \nwith all the tear-streaked grasping of the mass of gasping still unnamed \noppressed. \n \nCry to the horse, Go higher! Faster! offer painted apples that you think \nperhaps it might desire \nbut the frozen face is still the same, the simple cast of equine terror framed \nand caught in wood and plastic bulging eyes of fear. Its pace remaining as it \never was \nit does not care for coming pains as you are torn. Doesn't it know who you are? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 165 – Revolutions \n11 \n \nNo. And soon, neither will you. \n \nAlthough to call it ‘all is lost’ is more dramatic, yes, than has been earned \nfor those upon this carousel who have not been you already; perhaps \nthey know without a memory how good it is to have a face and name. It's not \nthe \nsame as what you had when first you climbed the brightly painted stairs \nbut not the worst who you have been. And as the horse drops through the air \ninto the \ncrowd of eager, waiting thieves you are unbowed and, yes, afraid, but still the \nmusic \nplays, and turns the world upon its gaudy axis. \n \nYou will be someone again, someday. \n \nThe hands and fingers reach and breach the gentle veiled complacency and \nrespite \nthat had just been yours upon your mount's ascent, and now the wood is bent \nand bowed \nas faceless things who long to be a who pull splinters from the rot \nof screaming saddle and of rider. You. Who feels the mask of sharp and hard \nidentity begin its gentle \nfracture into jagged shards of names that you once were. \n \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 165 – Revolutions \n12 \nI'm still Hannah! you try to scream, but are you? No. Perhaps there's some \nVeronica \nas fragments there, or Julian, or Anya, but no, you feel the last of names and \nwho you might have been be torn away and borne towards new bodies. New \npages, blank, determined to be people. \n \nThe rotten, ragged rush of fetid fingernails that dig and push and reach around \nthe edges of your face until they scrape against the bone in such a \nrough-scratched tone that rocks and echoes through the space that was your \nmind \nand when they peel it from you like \nthe skin of an orange the skin of an apple the skin of a pig the skin of a child \nthe skin of a you \nthen comes the briefest flash that surely now it's done so much perhaps the \npain will be somewhat lessened. \n \nThere's no way it could hurt as much as you remember. \n \nBut it does. \n \nAnd so of course you scream and scream and curses foul, obscene \nwill tumble garbled over where there once sat other people's lips or yours now \ngone \nand teeth that once shone yellowed ivory a crimson in the flowing sanguine \nflood.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 2, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 4029}}
