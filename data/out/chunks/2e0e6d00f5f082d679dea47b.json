I guess that’s \nnot directly relevant to my experience but I just want you \nto know that I’m not some crazy person wandering in off the street. I work, I \ndo practical things with my hands and I am not prone to crazed flights of fancy. \nThat day, I was going to see a matinee performance of The Trojan Women at \nThe Gate Theatre, up in Notting Hill. A friend of mine, Katherine Mendes, was \nin it and had been trying to get me to come to see it for a while. We’d worked \ntogether on a production of The Seagull a couple of years before and had had a \nbit of a thing going back then. At this point I had just become single, so was \nkeen to meet up and see if any of the old spark remained. I ended up going \nalong on the afternoon of Saturday the 10th of November – I remember the \ndate exactly, as there had been a lot of back-and-forth about it, since we were \nboth involved in separate shows at the time, making evenings difficult. \nSo, on Saturday afternoon I found myself in Notting Hill Gate, killing an hour or \ntwo before the show was due to start. Now, Notting Hill is not somewhere I go \noften, as it tends towards the pricey, even for London, and I’m not sure how \nmuch you know about theatre techs, but we’re not generally an overpaid \nprofession. Still, I had some vague memories of their being an Oxfam charity \nshop somewhere nearby, as I’d previously bought quite a nice old military tunic \nthere which remains one of my favourite jackets. I found it without any \nproblems and spent ten minutes or so looking over the clothes and \nknickknacks, but was a bit disappointed. It was smaller than I remembered and \njust seemed to contain the same tedious curios as every other charity shop. I \nstill had some time to kill, though, so I decided to have a look through their \nbooks, something I rarely bother doing usually.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 0, "chunk_count": 10, "chars": 2960}}
