His legs were long, but he crossed the room slowly, every one of \nhis joints moving and twisting as he took step after torturous step. There was \nno sound at all. I looked to my wife, but she was locked in a peaceful sleep. \nA thin beam of moonlight was clearly marked upon the floor, where a gap in \nthe curtains let it shine through. As the long dark foot touched it, I watched \nthat moonlight curdle like rancid milk. Wherever the Sandman touched, the \nworld dissolved into a choking darkness. First my door. Then creeping along \nthe distance of our bedroom. Then the bed itself. Then my Agatha. \nUntil all that was left was me, the darkness, and the dreadful thing that \nbrought it. \n\nI do not know how I had come to the conviction that I was in the Sandman’s \nsack. The idea simply arrived in my head fully formed. I had been taken, and \nwould remain here, trapped forever in this lightless place, without even the \nfaintest hint to taunt me. The darkness pressed in, and seemed to fill my \nmouth, my nose. But it did not touch my eyes. And then I made a choice. I still \nknew where the Sandman was, though I couldn’t tell you how, and I decided \nthat sightlessness was preferable to darkness. If you had asked me before, I \nwould have told you that there was no difference, but I know better now. \nThere is far more to the darkness than simply being unable to see. \nI reached out to where I knew the thing’s pouch would be, and seized a \nhandful of sand. It was already slick with my blood as I lifted it and cast it into \nmy face. I do not suppose I need to dwell upon the pain, but please know that I \nwould sooner die than endure it again. \nIt worked, though. Inasmuch as I have remained solidly within this world. In \nsome ways I left my sight behind in that awful place, but I am well rid of it, if it \nkept the rest of me here. I only wish the last thing I saw, the final vision burned \ninto my mind, had been anything other than that awful, shifting face. \nSo, there is my story. I’m sure you’ll agree that Maxwell Rayner is the clear \narchitect of my misfortune. Now, how do you suppose I revenge myself upon \nhim? \nMARTIN \n(Out of breath) End of statement. (Deep breath) I, um, I think I might need to \nsit down. Oh. Yeah, I am. Right. I don’t, uh, I’m not really sure if these are \nactually getting easier or harder. I mean I don’t feel— \nY-You know what, that’s not important. (Sigh) I wish John kept better \norganised notes because I know he’s mentioned someone called Maxwell \nRayner, but I cannot find much in the way of any info— \n[Door opens] \nMELANIE \nUh, Martin, have you seen Elias? \n\nMARTIN \nOh, uh... No, but Tuesday lunch he normally meets with the Library staff, I \nthink. He’ll… He’ll probably be back in his office in an hour or so? \nMELANIE \nAh, thanks. Er… Are you alright? \nMARTIN \nHm? Oh, I, yeah, I’ve... ah. Yeah, I’m fine. \nMELANIE \nYou just look really pale. \nMARTIN \nI… (Sigh) I was just recording one of the statements, and they are... \nMELANIE \nAh, right! Yes. They, um… they’re a lot, aren’t they? \nMARTIN \nSorry? \nMELANIE \nI mean they… they really take it out of you. I must have slept, er, twenty hours \nafter I did one. \nMARTIN \nHang on. You recorded a statement? \nMELANIE \nYes. It was about a bed, funnily enough. \nMARTIN \n\nI... I don’t suppose you’d mind doing some more? Elias wants to make up the \nshortfall while John’s away and what with Tim… \nMELANIE \nSure, no problem. Al-Although I was just going to have a talk with Elias, so, uh, \nmaybe I can convince him to cut you some slack. \nMARTIN \nI wouldn’t hold my breath. \nMELANIE \nRight. Fair. Listen, you really look like you could use a drink. Um, me and Basira \nwere just about to pop out. So… do you want to join us? \nMARTIN \nIt’s like one in the afternoon. \nMELANIE \nAre you afraid of getting fired? \nMARTIN \nHuh. I’ll get my coat. \nMELANIE \nGreat. Just, um, gimme, gimme an hour or so. I, I just have a few things to take \ncare of… first. \n[Door opens] \nMARTIN \nHuh. (Deep sigh) Oh, um, er, end recording. \n[Tape clicks off.
