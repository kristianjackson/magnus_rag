There might have been some official name in \nthe urban exploration community, I don’t know; he stopped using the jargon \naround me after I joked that ‘urbex’ sounded like a brand of drain cleaner. \nWhat he was talking about was the places where newer buildings had been \nconstructed in or, I don’t know, over the remains of an earlier one, but \ndevelopment had left some of the old pieces intact. Sometimes, it was just a \nwall or two, made out of a different material, but occasionally there’d be an \nentire hidden basement or bricked up room. I don’t know why, but Danny \n\nloved them. He’d talk for hours about “crumbling pieces of history desperately \nclinging onto existence”, but to be honest I never really got it. I guess I didn’t \nhave to. Anyway, according to him, London had more of these ‘ghost buildings’ \nthan anywhere else in the country. \nHe’d been exploring for a few months when he first mentioned Covent Garden \nTheatre. It had been destroyed by fire twice since it was first built in 1732, and \nwell, he was convinced that the current building stood on top of floors and \nfloors of hidden and abandoned ruins, “the discarded cocoons of its previous \nlife” as he once put it. He showed me maps and measurements, a few photo \nsets from others who’d apparently been there before. I never asked him to, \nbut well, when he was excited, he just wanted everyone else to share it. That \nwas… that was Danny. He was just… like that. While he was talking about the \nsecond Theatre Royal in Covent Garden, the one that lasted less than fifty \nyears before it burned down, that was when I first heard the name Robert \nSmirke. \nAll through this, I was trying to talk him out of going because, well, what had \nonce been the Covent Garden Theatre is nowadays known as the Royal Opera \nHouse, which is about as far from an abandoned building as you can get. And I \nreally didn’t think that trespassing there would be a good idea. But Danny \ndidn’t want to hear it. He wasn’t going into the main building, he told me, and \nhad figured out a route he claimed would lead him into the abandoned levels \nbelow without crossing anywhere that might actually attract security. And he \nwas going alone, so he didn’t need to worry about attracting too much \nattention. I told him it was a bad idea, but I’d never been able to stand in the \nway of his confidence. So late on Wednesday night in August 2013, my little \n\nbrother went to break into the ruins hidden under the Royal Opera House in \nCovent Garden. It sounds so ridiculous to say it out loud, but there it is. \nI don’t know how long he was gone. I went to bed around one in the morning, \nand he hadn’t gotten back. It was a hot night, and I woke up a few hours later \nneeding a glass of water. There were the first hints of dawn filtering in through \nmy living room windows, giving it this quiet, otherworldly feeling. Danny was \nsat in my big armchair, completely still. I smiled, feeling suddenly a little bit \nunsettled, and trying my best to hide it. I’d asked how it had been, but he \ndidn’t answer. I asked him if he’d found anything, and he nodded slowly. I saw \nas he tilted his head that his cheeks were just wet with tears. He mumbled \nsomething then, very quietly, and I couldn’t really make it out, but it sounded \nlike the name ‘Joey’. It was all kind of surreal, strange, and I started to think I \nmight be dreaming, but I’d never seen him cry before. I tried to talk to him, \nfind out what was wrong, but he just kept shaking his head. We sat there in \nsilence for a long time. I didn’t know what to do; the whole situation was so \nalien. I thought maybe I could try and get him some rest, let him collect \nhimself, so after some coaxing, I got him onto the couch. As he laid down, I \nheard him say something else. I thought it sounded like “the show must go \non”, and at that moment, you know, I actually thought that was a good sign. I \nwatched for a few more minutes until he was asleep, and then I went back to \nbed, though it was a while before I fell back to sleep. \nThat night was the last time I ever saw Danny. When I woke up a few hours \nlater, he was gone. \nHe left no note, no hint of where he may have gone, and the only thing that \nshowed he’d been back at all were a small pile of sketches he’d drawn on some \nscrap paper from my printer. On each there was a clown, the same clown. A", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 2, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 4493}}
