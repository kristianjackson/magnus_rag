I mean, yeah, they’re \nobviously Magnus’ eyes, but that’s still a Bouchard body up there so... so \nmaybe Magnus’ original body is just still lying around here somewhere? That, \nthat was a weakness before the transformation, so… maybe we could still use \nthat? \nARCHIVIST \nIt’s gone. Ashes swept away by the winds of ecstatic terror. What you see up \nthere is all that remains. \nMARTIN \nRight. \n(Sighing) (softly) Right, right, right. \n…Is the original Elias still in there somewhere? \nARCHIVIST \nHe’s, uh, I— \nMARTIN \nMaybe we could get through to him somehow? \nARCHIVIST \nAh, no, it isn’t that— Ahh… \n[Ceaseless chanting ceases; a whirl of wind with paper noises and \ntwo feet landing] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 193 – A Stern Look \n \n8 \n[Hissing static starts] \nMARTIN \n(Annoyed sigh) Again? But you just did one for Ro— \n(Realisation) Ro— Oh no... \n[Much of the Panopticon sounds fade; however the slow pulse \nremains] \n[Hissing static ends] \n[As when the Archivist channels a victim’s experience, his voice no \nlonger has reverb] \n[The ticking clock of Elias’ office, and the occasional rustle of paper] \nARCHIVIST \nHe recognises those eyes. He’s seen them all his life, watching him, judging \nhim, cutting through him so no part of him was secret or safe. They peel away \nthe armour, his carefree smile and practiced shrugs. They are the eyes of his \nfather, and they stare at Elias over an old mahogany desk, sat in the face of a \nman who said his name was James Wright. His interviewer smiles with his \nmouth, but the eyes are the same. \n[Paper turning noise] \n(Each time Jonah/Elias speaks, it combines the static-distort, low voice of the \ncurrent Jonah with the characteristic sound of Elias before the apocalypse; as \nwell, the background noises of the Panopticon creep in) \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 193 – A Stern Look \n \n9 \nJONAH/ELIAS \nSo tell me, Elias. What are you afraid of? \nARCHIVIST \nElias Bouchard freezes in place. The question catches him completely off-\nguard. Why would he ask him something like that? Elias is applying for a \nresearch job — what the hell does that matter? \n[Chair creaks] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \n“Why, uh… Why do you ask?” He gets the words out through a throat that \ndoesn’t want to speak. \nJONAH/ELIAS \nIn the Institute we are keenly interested in the anatomy of fear. Much that is \nstored here is disquieting. It is important to know if anything here might... \nupset you. \nARCHIVIST \nHis mind races. He can’t tell the truth, obviously. Elias can’t look this man in \nthe face, and tell him that he is what scares him. That his eyes, the curiosity \nand judgement that pulses out of them, they terrify him in a way he can’t put \ninto words. He feels that prickly panic building in the back of his skull, that \nworry that spills through: he knows. He knows I’m high. The thought leaps to \nElias’ mind for only a second before he remembers that — he’s not. He hasn’t \nlit up all day, of course not, he’s got an interview. But even so, he can’t shake \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 193 – A Stern Look \n \n10 \nthe familiar paranoia. He looks again at his would-be employer, who seems like \nhe’s about to repeat the question. \n“Spiders,” Elias says quickly. “I’m afraid of spiders.” \nJames Wright nods, the smile curling into one of satisfaction, though Elias is \nsure the man doesn’t believe him. Those eyes break contact for a moment, \nflicking up to the corner of the office where, at the edge of a bookshelf that \nsags with age and weight, a small cobweb has started to form. \nJONAH/ELIAS \nVery wise. A very sensible fear. \nARCHIVIST \nIt is. Yeah, it is. But is it… true? For a moment, Elias really can’t remember. \nRight here and now, the thought of a spider genuinely repulses him. \n[Chair squeaks start as Elias shifts uncomfortably] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nThe image of a scuttling, filthy creature, eight eyes glinting out in the darkness, \ncrawls into his mind, and he shudders, looking away for a second. But the \nuninvited thought keeps going. \n[Fabric and itching sounds, that intensify] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nHe imagines the spider moving up his leg, his body, he imagines feeling its \nbristling hairs against the skin of his shoulder, his throat, his cheek. It’s spindly \nprobing legs finding their way up his face.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 2, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 4273}}
