And I had no sooner done this than a powerful \nsleep overtook me. \nI had a dream, then. I dreamt a rain had come. A terrible bitter rain that chilled \nmy bones and turned the soil around me dark and sodden. The walls grew damp \nand slippery, their firm shape lost as they began to slip and crumble. And then all \nat once they collapsed, the grave filling in a moment with a wave of mud and wet \ndirt. In a single terrible moment of utter terror, it was atop and around me, \ncovering my face and filling my lungs with its awful choking sod. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 152 – A Gravedigger’s Envy \n6 \n \nAnd the strangest thing was that it was wonderful. I had never felt such safety as \nwithin the crushing weight of earth all around me, the pressing embrace of the \nburied. In that instant I knew what it was to be dead, and I ached with envy for \nthem. \nWhen I awoke I was above ground again, amid the graves. The rain had been no \ndream, and I was cold and soaked through, wracked with a chill you may well \ndiscern from the quality of my hand. It was true, also, that the rain had caused the \ngrave to collapse, though I must have left it shortly before that happened. I was in \nno state to address the issue, however, and in fact the Reverend had to ask the \nsexton from St. Mark’s to do so, as I am still laid up in bed with this cough. (heh) \nPerhaps I shall be joining the churchyard sooner than I dared hope. \nWrite me back soon, for I have precious little to do in this invalid’s bed, and sleep \nis far from me once again. \nYour humble servant, \nHezekiah \nJune, 1838 \nI must first thank you for your visit, Nathaniel, although my recovery were well \ncompleted, it is always most heartening to see an old friend. I hope that the \nbusiness that drew your way so abruptly were well completed, and that I may \nanticipate your company again after not too long. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 152 – A Gravedigger’s Envy \n7 \n \nI must tell you I’ve been in some distress these last few weeks, due in no small \npart of the agitation of the Reverend, who has, of late, succumbed to a very \nspecific, though understandable, mania. \nThe circumstances and causes are easy enough to explain. It was the funeral of \nyoung Nellie Cooper that did it, which was a most upsetting affair. I’ll say I have \nmuch sympathy with his plight, as I had a chance to view the body myself, and if \nyou’d asked me if I concurred with Doctor Grant’s judgments of death by \ndrowning, I would have agreed without hesitation. She had that peace to her that \nI’ve spoken of to you before, and I knew how happy she must be to soon be \nreturning to the earth. \nBut that day, as they carried the slim coffin down towards the hole that I had dug, \nand so recently enjoyed my own calm repose, there was a commotion among the \npallbearers. Little Nellie’s coffin began shaking and rocking back and forth, such as \nthey were unable to keep their footing and dropped it. The crash of the wooden \ncasket hitting the earth is a sound I’ll not forget in a hurry, nor the shriek that \ncame from inside the splintered wood as it burst open. \nAs you may well have surmised, Nellie was not, after all, dead, and had shaken off \nthe stupor mere minutes before she was due to be placed below ground. She’s \nunharmed, at least in body, though I can scarce imagine the maddening strain \nmust have put on her to see her own tombstone carved and waiting above the \ndark silence of her open grave.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 2, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 3596}}
