I-I mean, no, I just... \nARCHIVIST \nDon’t like ants? \nMARTIN \nObviously not. No-one likes ants, John. \nARCHIVIST \nAs the embodiment of all knowledge, I am not entirely sure that’s true but… \nokay. What is it? \nMARTIN \nN-No, it’s just… you know the guy you were talking about? Jordan? \nARCHIVIST \nThe exterminator, yes. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 184 – Like Ants \n9 \nMARTIN \nI was having a look around and... I found him. A few tunnels over. \nARCHIVIST \nYes. I know. \nMARTIN \nAh sorry, yeah, of course you do. Oh, stupid. \nARCHIVIST \nNo, it’s alright. I’ve-I’ve been trying to... I’m not sure what to do about it. \nMARTIN \nWell, who’s the avatar in charge here then? That Amherst guy? \nARCHIVIST \nNo, John Amherst was encased in concrete, and shrivelled away to nothing \nafter just a few years. If they’d unearthed him before the change, maybe, but \nas it was he was so starved of fear... \nMARTIN \nSo who, then? \nARCHIVIST \nWell, I’m not sure if… \nMARTIN \nJohn who is it? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 184 – Like Ants \n10 \nARCHIVIST \nIt’s the ants. \nMARTIN \nWhat? Ohhhh, like a, like a huge ant queen or something? \nARCHIVIST \nNo. All of them. As a collective. Crawling, devouring, spreading. One colony, \none being, one avatar. \n(Further sounds of martin’s lack of enthusiasm) \nMARTIN \nRight. Great. \n [Martin moves about] \nMARTIN (CONT’D) \nNo. No. Do not like that one at all. No. Okay. So what happens if you destroy \nthem then? I-I mean, if they’re both the avatar and the domain? \nARCHIVIST \nThe whole place would collapse and then without The Corruption’s influence, I \nthink The Buried would flow in to fill the gap. \nMARTIN \nI thought you said Smirke’s Fourteen was a load of bull? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 184 – Like Ants \n11 \nARCHIVIST \nI said it was limited, and draws artificial borders, but it does have its use when \nit comes to conceptualising these things. Regardless, I’m pretty sure we’d be \nleft somewhat... entombed. \nMARTIN \nBut we could get out, though? \nARCHIVIST \nEventually. \n…Martin, do you want me to... \nMARTIN \nNo. No, probably not a good idea. \nARCHIVIST \nHm. \nOh, uh, Martin, just one, one second… you got… \n(Martin’s expresses extreme displeasure at finding ants on himself) \n[Extended sounds of Martin patting and swiping his clothes as he \ncontinues talking] \nMARTIN \nDefinitely one of my least favourites, so far. Can we just go then? Please? \nARCHIVIST \nI’m still not sure what to do about Jordan. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 184 – Like Ants \n12 \nMARTIN \nI mean, what can we do really? You’ve been pretty clear there’s no way for us \nto help the people who are trapped here as victims so... so, we leave him here \nlike all the others, and eventually we save everyone. \nARCHIVIST \nYeah... I just... I don’t usually know them. Jordan Kennedy did me a favour. He \nhelped me with my own fear, a-about Jane Prentiss. \nMARTIN \nI sometimes forget that most of the people we know are avatars. \nARCHIVIST \nYes, that... Hmm. Not sure I like that realisation. Our peers... \nMARTIN \nYeah. Dinner parties are going to be tricky. \n(Brief, sad, chuckles) \nSo what are we doing John? \nARCHIVIST \nI want to see him. \nMARTIN \nFine. Do your ‘knowing’ thing and then we can— \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 184 – Like Ants \n13 \nARCHIVIST \nWith my eyes. \nMARTIN \n…Okay. But just so you know, the tunnels to get there are absolutely craw— \nYeah, okay. Yes, no, yes, you already know. \nLead on. \n[Tape clicks off] \n[Tape clicks on] \n[The echoes of ants swarming in a larger chamber and sounds of a \nperson flailing] \n(Jordan wails plaintively and hopelessly) \nMARTIN \nChrist... \nJohn? \nJORDAN \nYou...
