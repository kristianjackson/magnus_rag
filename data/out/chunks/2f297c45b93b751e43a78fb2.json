Leaving the front door of her practice unlocked was no doubt \ngood for her clients, but also provided me with easy access when I finally \novercame my trepidation. \nI had paid great attention to how loud the door was and timed my entry to the \npassing of a butcher's truck, the roar of the engine covering the sound of the \ndoor. And then, just like that, I was inside. I cursed myself for not having spent \nmore time trying to get a sense of the interior of the building, as I had not \nexpected the waiting room to be so sparse. There were three uncomfortable \nlooking wooden chairs, several bookshelves filled with worn looking \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 062 – First Edition \n \n8 \n \npaperbacks and a dim bulb in a wire cage. There was only a single door leading \nfurther into the building, with a peeling coat of plain, white paint. My plan had \nbeen to find somewhere to hide, but it didn't look like there was anywhere \nactually to do so. I remember I was stood there, still wondering what to do, \nwhen I heard heavy footsteps approaching from behind the door. \nI froze, looking around desperately for anywhere to hide myself as the steps \ndrew closer. I had just made the decision to flee the way I had come, when the \ndoor opened. A short man with a bristling moustache walked out, clutching a \nslip of paper that looked to be a prescription. He nodded at me curtly as he \nwalked past and left through the front door without saying a word. I breathed \na sigh of relief and looked down the corridor he had come from. \nIt was darker than I expected. The lightbulb had either blown or been turned \noff and there didn't seem to be any windows to let in the faint glow of daylight. \nThere was a staircase along one side, opposite a door labelled with Dr \nTillerson's name, which I assumed to be her office. As I approached, I noticed a \nsizeable crack in the wood below the staircase, and looking closer, saw a small \ndoor to an under-stair storage area. Opening it as quietly as I could, I saw it \nwas empty and, judging by the dust, didn't look like it was ever used. I crawled \ninside and closed the door behind me, delighted to find my suspicions had \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 062 – First Edition \n \n9 \n \nbeen correct: through the crack in the wood I had a clear view of the doctor's \ndoor and, I hoped, what was behind it. \nI didn't have to wait long to find out. A few minutes after I had settled in my \nhiding place, I saw the office door open and Dr Tillerson stepped out. She \nwalked briskly into waiting room and, after a few seconds of muffled \nconversation, led an elderly man back into her office. She entered first, leaving \nher patient to close the door behind him. He did not, and I was treated to a \ngood view of her workplace. It was tiled, clean and shining, with a large, brown \nleather examination table upon which the old man perched as she hovered \naround him, poking, measuring and asking questions I couldn't quite hear. \nThere was a small, sparse desk in one corner, a cabinet affixed to the wall that I \nassumed contained her medicines and equipment, and on the floor, I could see \na squat iron safe. I immediately knew that whatever fearful secrets drew me \ntowards this doctor, they would be found within that safe. \nI saw nothing of importance that day. Or the day after that, when I snuck back \ninto the same space. I haunted the cramped shadows beneath that staircase \nfor almost a week before it happened. I was always careful to be home when \nmy mother would be there, but that wasn't difficult, and Dr Tillerson never \nseemed to lock the door to her practice. I remember it was a Sunday and the \nsummer had made my hiding place almost intolerably hot. It must have been", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 2, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 3785}}
