She knows he’s in there, she can hear him occasionally. \nAnd he likes her, Rosie’s pretty sure of that. She is perhaps the only person on \nEarth in a position to help, to at least ask what is happening, to ask why. But \nnow all she can do is sit there and smile, waiting for the intercom. \n[Intercom switch clicks with office reverb] \n[Current-day London sounds stop; replaced by office ambience and \nthe sounds of a police radio; footsteps and metal clicks as they \nwalk past her] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 192 – An Appointment \n \n24 \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nThere should have been relief, when they led him out in handcuffs. A weight \nremoved, a tightness loosed from her chest. But there wasn’t. Mr Bouchard \nhad smiled at her as the inspector marched him out. He wasn’t even surprised. \nShe hadn’t smiled back. She hadn’t smiled in a long time, except for that \npainful customer service grin she had forced onto her face when Mr Bouchard \nhad visitors. Visitors like... \n[Lonely static rises then falls to a faint level] \n[A few boot steps; Rosie’s chair creaks] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nOf course. The floating unease settled into shape as soon as she saw Mr Lukas. \nRosie knew what he was going to say before he even opened his mouth. \n“Rosie, right? I’m Peter Lukas. Elias asked me to look after the Institute while \nhe was away. So, I guess that makes you my assistant. Right?” \nShe knew all about Peter Lukas, of course. Bouchard had always been very \ncareful to leave his files in conspicuous enough locations for her. She knew \nhe’d been preparing her. She didn’t want to let him down. Or did she? Rosie \ndidn’t even know any more. At the very least, he’d never lied to her, never \nfailed to validate her suspicions or indulge her snooping. As afraid as she was, \nhe seemed to understand her. And as much as she disliked this temporary \nreplacement, she knew she was going to stay. \n[Lonely static stops] \n[Intercom switch clicks with Panopticon reverb] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 192 – An Appointment \n \n25 \n[Office sounds cease; replaced by distant and muffled current-day \nLondon: helicopters and crowd screaming] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nPeople have come to see Elias. No. Not people. Not anymore. They stare \nthrough her, and she knows that she was never going to help. She smiles at \nthem, and politely informs them that Mr Bouchard isn’t seeing anyone without \nan appointment. Her face aches, and her teeth buzz in her gums. \n[Intercom switch clicks with office reverb] \n[Current-day London sounds stop; replaced by office ambience that \nis devoid of additional people] \n[A few uncertain steps from Rosie, before she sits down at \nher desk] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nWhere else could she have gone? Mr Lukas was dead. Mr Bouchard was \nmissing. So many friends and colleagues dead. The violence, the gunshots. The \nold man and his... daughter? Their murderous joy. She couldn’t stop thinking \nabout their faces. How they had looked right past her as they ran through the \nbuilding. \nOver now, of course. Weeks ago. Too early to forget but too late to act. Wasn’t \nthat always the way? Her flat was empty and silent. All her friends and family \nnow so distant as to be almost strangers. What else could she have done \nexcept come in to work? She didn’t know who for or why. She had simply sat at \nher desk and waited for the phone to ring. She waited and she waited. \n[Long building creak]", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 6, "chunk_count": 9, "chars": 3609}}
