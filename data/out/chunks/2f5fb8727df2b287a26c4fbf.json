Not \nso much. I don’t know what I was going to do, I think I was going to \ntry and hit her, but that’s when Sasha knocked me to the floor. It, it \nwas a good move, actually. Prentiss didn’t seem to expect it, and \nwe crushed a lot of worms when we fell. They were slow to react, \nand we were running before they really went for us. I mean, all this \nhappened in the space of a few seconds, so I’m not exactly certain. \nSasha had to basically drag me behind her. I saw the shelf in front \nof us was about to topple. There were so many worms on it so, \nbeing the hero I am, I let go of her hand and told her to get help. \nShe made it out the main door. I turned to run into the office. I was \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG040 – Human Remains \n10 \n \njust trying to get a door between me and Prentiss. I didn’t know \nthat’s where you made the first hole. \n \nThere were loads of them. Some jumped at me as I ran inside so I \ndodged out the way, but ended up sprawling into this pile of boxes \nthat I thought were case files. Instead, I found myself lying on top \nof a whole bunch of CO2 canisters, which are damn hard by the \nway. The worms were still coming, so I used them. I mean, I went \nfull Gas-Rambo. After that... my memory gets a bit fuzzy.I think the \nparamedic called it ‘respiratory acidosis’… from breathing in all the \ncarbon dioxide, rather than your more traditional oxygen. I \nremember finishing the first few extinguishers killing the things, \nbut they kept coming, so I grabbed a few more, and saw the \nmassive hole in the wall. There didn’t seem much point staying, so I \nwent into the tunnels. They were cold, dry. You know that worm \nsmell? That earthy rotten smell? \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nOh yes. \n \nTIM \nWell, yeah. There weren’t so many down there. I think they were \nalmost all in the Archives. I have a theory, actually. I think they \nweren’t ready to attack when you found the tunnels. It’s like, \nsomething in the Institute slows them down, and makes them, um, \nheh, sluggish. \n \nAnd that noise they make? That squirming sound? They don’t \nmake it when they’re in the tunnels. I don’t know why. It was only \nwhen they came into the Institute. Maybe the light, or the aircon, or \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG040 – Human Remains \n11 \n \nsomething? I’m not sure, but I think it made them weaker, and \nthey’ve been down there for months, breeding, building up their \nnumbers until there were enough to properly bury us. Except you \nfound that hidden passage, and they had to act. \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \n Maybe. Could you… describe the tunnels? \n \nTIM \nYou were there. \n \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nHumour me. \n \nTIM \nI remember they sloped down and up and around. I couldn’t keep \ntrack of where I was. I did see some more worms, though. They \nwere fast. I only saw a couple, but it was still proper jumpscare \nterritory. I got them, though. It was really surreal. I only had my \nphone’s torch, and it was hard to keep an eye out, I was so light \nheaded. \nI wandered for, I don’t know, maybe ten minutes before I found a \nwall that seemed different. It looked like someone had just put \nsome plasterboard over an entrance, and I could hear you and \nMartin on the other side. I broke through and, well, you were there \nfor the rest. \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG040 – Human Remains \n12 \n \nQuite. You… you weren’t there when Martin found the body, \nthough, were you? \n \nTIM \nNo. I was quarantined, same as you. \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nAnd you didn’t see it in the tunnels when you were first exploring? \n \n TIM \nNo. I did see... uh, I mean, maybe... \nJONATHAN SIMS \nWhat? \n \nTIM \nNo, it’s just... I think I was still gassed, and it was dark, but... I found \na room. \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nGo on. \n \nTIM \nI didn’t stay long, ‘cause it had a lot of worms in, and they weren’t \nacting like the others. They were sort of... wrapping around each \nother, like they were trying to form a... thing, like a structure or \nsomething. A ring. \nI was probably still out of my skull, and half-hallucinated the whole \nthing, but it looked like they were trying to make a doorway. \n \nJONATHAN SIMS", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 3, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 4087}}
