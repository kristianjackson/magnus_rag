I wanted to, I really did, but it was always the work. Sometimes \nshe just reminded me of my mum. Did you ever meet her, my mum? \nARCHIVIST \n(Flustered) Erm… Not in, not in person, it was er... O-Only by reputation. \nGERARD \nHuh. Well, she was also, um, ‘goal-orientated’. Ruthless. But at least Gertrude \ntried to do something worthwhile with it. My mum only had her ambitions. \nShe’d never have even admitted it, though. She was too proud for that. She \nsaw herself as real working class, always said the occult was just a club for rich \nboys playing politics with things they didn’t understand. Reckoned her \ntradition was less the academic and more the, uh... \nARCHIVIST \n\nV-Village witch? \nGERARD \n(Laughingly) You sure you don’t know her? \nYeah. But deep down what she wanted wasn’t all that different from the ivory \ntower idiots she hated. Y’know, I think, secretly, she dreamed of starting a little \nmystic dynasty of her own. With me. \nARCHIVIST \nLike the, the Lukases? Or the Fairchilds? \nGERARD \nWell, Fairchild’s just a name, they’re not really family. The Lukases, though, \nyeah. Thing is, it’s harder than it looks. What’s out there... doesn’t care about \nblood. \nARCHIVIST \nWell, I-I mean, except for the vampires… \nGERARD \nYeah, obviously except for the vampires. But they care about your choices, \nyour fears, not your parents. Families are just useful ‘cause they can push you \nin the right direction. And the Lukases are very good at that. \nARCHIVIST \nAnd I imagine they’re not… reluctant to remove any members that might put \nthat legacy at risk. \nGERARD \nRight. You know, for a group that worships a power of loneliness, they never \nseem to have any problems breeding, or finding spooky singles to marry them. \nJust one of those things, I guess. \n\nBut most times you try to put your descendants on the path to worship, it \ndoesn’t go great. Just takes one stubborn heir to freak out about the truth, and \nthe whole thing comes crashing down. \nARCHIVIST \nAnd… that was you? \nGERARD \nYeah. Turns out not everyone grows up caring about power and knowledge like \nmy mum. \nARCHIVIST \nWhat happened? \nGERARD \nI tried to abandon her. \nARCHIVIST \nI see. \nDo you… want to make a statement? \nGERARD \n(Laughs) Why not? I’ll try to make it quick, before the Van Helsings get bored. \nARCHIVIST \nRight. (Coughs) Right. \nEr… Statement of Gerard Keay, deceased, regarding the death of his mother, \nMary Keay. \nStatement taken posthumously from subject, June 30th 2017. \nStatement begins. \nGERARD [STATEMENT] \n\nMy mother spent her whole life feeling cheated. She used to tell me with a \nkind of sneer that “destiny is for lords”, and I think in her own way she actually \nbelieved that. You know, she felt we weren’t important enough for a destiny. \nBut she never forgot that she came a noble house: Von Closen. All wrapped up \nin mystery and power. At least, that’s what my mum believed. I was never able \nto find much on them, at all. Nothing that would say there was anything special \nabout them except, y’know, maybe their connection to the Magnus Institute \nand Jonah Magnus. But she’d never accept that. To her, her ancestors were \nthese ‘powerful sages of terrible gods’, their ‘destinies stolen from them by an \nidle dilettante’. (Snorts) Least that’s how she told it to me. \nI remember that Jurgen Leitner was the first man I ever really hated. I’d never \nmet him, but that was the name on the books that my mum spent all her time \nreading, and half the time when she actually looked at me, it was to teach me \nabout one of them. She idolised him, I think, almost as much as she despised \nhim. She thought he’d managed what she always dreamed of: using these \nentities, without being bound to them. I think she saw him as some kind of \nsorcerer. So she studied those books that she could find, but she always came \nback to this one, this unnamed catalogue of the trapped dead. It was her first, \nshe always told me, and would probably be her last. \nI never knew my dad. Not really. He worked in the Archives like you, but quit \nonce I was born. I think he wanted to help raise me. But mum didn’t need the \nhelp, and after me she wasn’t able to have kids again, so she killed him in his \nsleep to practice her bookbinding. I guess she failed. I always thought he was in \nhere, but when I eventually got hold of it, there wasn’t a page in there. \nShe did her best to look after me, and bring me into this world she inhabited, \nbut she wasn’t a caring mother or a s", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 2, "chunk_count": 9, "chars": 4499}}
