Her last thoughts a certainty of the yawning well of \nnothingness that awaits her as consciousness slips away. Danika takes another \nstep along the corpse root. \nFive: Coroner's concerns. \nI watch, as with each motion, each laboured, reluctant movement along her \npath, Danika Gelsthorpe is painfully and inescapably aware of what it is that \nlies at the end of it. She tries to move backwards, off to the side, any direction \nother than that unstoppable, inescapable forwards. But her limbs seize up with \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 168 – Roots \n15 \nthe attempt. She tries to stay still, but can do so only with the most incredible \nof efforts. To eke out another few seconds of stasis sets every nerve in her \nbody aflame with agony and effort, begging her to scream despite her jaw \nbeing set in a frozen rictus of sombre mourning. \nI see her relive the coming moment of her inevitable demise. Every inch along \nthe route she moves, she sees another flash of what is to come, the sickening \nknowledge of where she is going, the sensation of traveling there, through the \nmovements of her own body, as much as those movements may be made \nunder duress. No amount of protest or effort can travel any other way but \ntowards the end. \nSometimes, for some small variety, I will allow Danika to brush against another \nroute. The final fate of someone she loves. She may see Maria lying in her \nhospital bed, monitors crowding her as the doctors struggle to get an IV into \nher wildly convulsing arm. She might have a flash of Bobby, fingers tightening \naround the rungs of the ladder as the rusted nails give way. She often sees \nDennis's face as the knife slips eagerly between his ribs, even though he \ndoesn't die for hours afterwards. And with each one she knows her steps \nforward bring closer not only her own end, but all of theirs. Time walks \nforward with her but she has not the strength to stop it. \nHer fate draws ever-nearer, filling me with the joy of watchful fear, but also my \nown concerns. \nThe matters of concern are as follows: \nA: When Danika Gelsthorpe reaches the end of her corpse root, she will die. \nThis new world of fear reviles death as a release, but the Coming End cannot \nexist without its reality. It is not a being of dangled promises and shifting \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 168 – Roots \n16 \ntorments. The certainty of death waits for all who travel the corpse roots, and \nthat certainty will be delivered on, without hesitation or consideration of any \nother factors. \nB: This places a limit on the fear that can be generated from them, as their \npool is necessarily finite and ultimately, however slowly, it will be exhausted. \nTo be offset, this consideration will require the acquisition of victims from \nother domains as replacements, potentially inciting... bad feeling between \nthose domains. \nC: A metaphysical quirk of this new reality's divorce from the traditional \nconcept of time, and, one for which I have no further explanation, means that I \ndo not believe new humans are being created or born. The souls trapped \nwithin this transformed world are the only ones that will ever be here, and the \npresence of the Termination of All requires that, ultimately, that is what will \nhappen. However slowly, the domains of death will be removing sufferers from \na closed system. However many thousands of years may be experienced in the \nmeantime, eventually this world will be left barren and empty. \nD: When this happens, the great powers themselves will also fade and die, \nwithering away into nothingness and releasing this reality from their grip. I… \ndo not know how I feel about this. \nSix: Actions that should be taken. \nNone. Even if such a fate could be avoided, as it comes closer and the other \nentities grow in their awareness of their own end, the grotesque ripples of \ntheir own impossible panic shall glut and feed my master, gorging it to the \npoint where perhaps it will even surpass the Watcher in prominence.
