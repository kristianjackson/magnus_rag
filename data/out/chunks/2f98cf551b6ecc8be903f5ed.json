There \nwas something compelling about it, though. The debate about how finished \nThe Canterbury Tales were… well, it's a very real debate. In the Prologue, over \na hundred tales are promised, but the most complete surviving version doesn't \neven reach two dozen. The book just sort of ends, with Chaucer adding a short \nepilogue imploring God for forgiveness. A plea that is generally read as \nsarcastic or rhetorical. \nI flicked ahead a few pages, and found the Bonesmith had apparently crept up \nto the Miller while he slept. It described him silently reaching inside him, and... \nit's a bit hazy. All I remember clearly is the line “and from his rib a flute to play \nthat merry tune of marrow took”. And as for the rest, I don't recall in detail, \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG017 – The Boneturner’s Tale \n12 \n \nbut I know that I almost threw up, and that the Miller did not survive. This was \non page sixteen, and it was a thick book. \nI turned to the frontispiece, desperately curious as to how this book had ended \nup in our library. In the harsh light of the torch, I could see the creases and \npeeling edges of the Chiswick Library label, which usually meant it had been \nremoved and re-stuck, or taken from another book entirely. I could even see \nthe edges of another label underneath. Using a pair of scissors, I carefully \npeeled off the top one, but was disappointed. It was the label for another \nlibrary, probably the last place it had been left, although I think it must have \nbeen in Scandinavia, because it was something like the library of Jergensburg \nor Jurgenleit or Jurgerlicht or something like that. It didn't help me. \nI was all set to return to reading the thing, when I heard the sound of breaking \nglass behind me. I turned around to see Jared Hopworth standing in front of \nthe shattered window. Or at least, I assume it was Jared, as it demanded the \nbook from me in Jared's voice, but wore lose fitting trousers, and a thick coat \nwith a hood that almost completely covered his face. Or its face. \nHe was longer than Jared had been, and stood at a strange angle, as though his \nlegs were too stiff to use. When he gestured for the book, I saw that his fingers \nlooked… sharp, as though the skin at the ends were being pushed into a tight \npoint by something inside. I told him that the library was closed, because at \nthat moment I could think of nothing else to say. He ignored me, and \ndemanded again that I give him the book. That was when I did something a \nlittle rash, which is to say I punched him. \nI had never really thrown a punch in anger before, or even desperation, so it \ncame as quite a shock to me when I managed to drive a single, solid fist into his \nsolar plexus. But as I did this, and this is the part that still gives me nightmares,", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 6, "chunk_count": 9, "chars": 2789}}
