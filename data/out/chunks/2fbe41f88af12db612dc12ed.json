And it certainly was a discovery, in the \nmost literal sense. On the fifth floor of an apartment building on the Rue \nLagarde, near the Panthéon, some construction workers had uncovered a door \nthat had at some point in the past been completely plastered over. Removing \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 134 – Time of Revelation \n \n4 \n \nthe covering and breaking through the old wood revealed another apartment, \none apparently unnoticed by any of the other residents, or indeed the owners \nof those sections of the building, each of which had assumed the space was \nowned by one of the others and connected to a different part. As far as anyone \nwas able to determine, the apartment had been sitting there, sealed and \nundisturbed, for almost a hundred and fifty years. It was untouched, pristine, \nwith barely a thin layer of fine dust coating the possessions and belongings \nthat had stayed there for so long. A few objects identified the place as \nbelonging to Hillier, including a short journal, and so the local authority, baffled \nas to what to do with this find, had called a history professor from the \nSorbonne, who had passed it on to Bernadette, as she was one of the few \nacademics familiar with Hillier. \nShe went immediately. While the confusion over legal ownership would \nprobably keep the place in limbo for some time, Bernadette was also acutely \naware that it meant there would be limited protections in place as well, and \nshe was keen to see it before anything too drastic happened to it. She got her \nwish, and her colleague even managed to supply her with a photocopy of the \njournal, though it made little real sense. It talked of Garland Hillier’s “new \nrevelation” about the “absolute change of the world” in terms that seemed at \nfirst elegiac, but later seemed almost panicked, with the final entry simply \nrepeating the words “la porte est la porte”, “the door is the door”. Clearly his \nmental state had been in decline, and Bernadette said she could not help \ndwelling on the image of this poor man, his whole world shifting and falling \naway from him, lost and alone in his tiny apartment, gradually losing himself, \nuntil at last, he lay down and simply did not get up again. But that couldn’t be \nthe case, she knew, as there had been no sign of a body.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 2, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 2707}}
