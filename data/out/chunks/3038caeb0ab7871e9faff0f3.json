Maybe \nSims didn’t do this alone. \nELIAS \nPlease, Detective Tonner. You don’t want this to happen in the police station \nany more than I do. Your superiors, exactly how aware are they of what you’re \ndoing right now? \nDAISY \nThey know enough. They got a call and sent me down here. That’s how it \nworks. \nELIAS \nAnd then they don’t ask any questions, as long as you keep it far away from \nofficial police channels. \nExcept your partner leaving has made you sloppy. No notes, no proper \ninterrogations, no back-up of any sort. You’ve barely collected a scrap of \nevidence from the scene, and made no official record of the dozens of \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG082 – The Eyewitnesses \n12 \n \ninterviews you’ve done with the Institute staff. You haven’t even followed up \non any of the other potential suspects or leads, and shown no interest at all in \nthe fate of Sasha James. \nAll you care about is where John is, because you’ve decided on a course of \naction, and you’re going to follow it through. \nDAISY \n(Pause) If you’re right, what’s to stop me kicking your teeth in? No cameras \ndown here, remember. I can always just turn off that little recorder of yours. \nSmash it up. \nELIAS \nVery true. However, you aren’t going to do that, Detective. Because of Calvin \nBenchley. \nDAISY \nWhat? \nELIAS \nCalvin Benchley. You recognise the name, don’t you Alice? You see, I know \nwhat you did. \nDAISY \nI… don’t know what you’re talking about. \nELIAS \nNo? The scar may have faded, but you haven’t forgotten. Did it itch, just a \nlittle, when you were burying him? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG082 – The Eyewitnesses \n13 \n \nDAISY \nYou shut the hell up, or I swear I’ll kill you. \nELIAS \nA genuine threat, I’m sure, but right now what you’re really trying to figure out \nis, if I have any evidence that could make it back to your people. It seems \nimpossible, of course – how could I? But you just don’t know. So many \nimpossible things happen in here, in this strange, musty place. \nDAISY \nShut up! \nELIAS \nHere’s what’s going to happen. I’m going to make a statement. Your \nstatement. To prove to you what I know, and because I want John to hear it \nsomeday. And when it’s over, you are going to leave. Because if you don’t, I’ll \nmake sure your superiors know all about every nasty little thing you’ve done in \nthe name of peace and order, and I’ll make sure they are subject to the \nscrutiny they so desperately want to avoid. More importantly, I’ll make sure \nthey know it has all been exposed because of you. Is that clear? \n(Pause) I will take that as a yes. \nIf you’re smart, you’ll go back to the police station and put forward some half-\nbaked cover-up for what happened to your mystery corpse and leave it at that. \nBut I don’t think you are smart, so in many ways I’m excited to find out what \nyou do next. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG082 – The Eyewitnesses \n14 \n \n(Pause) Statement of Alice Tonner, regarding the crimes and death of Calvin \nBenchley. Statement never given. \nDAISY \nDon’t. \nELIAS (STATEMENT) \nEveryone calls me Daisy. I like that because it sounds so gentle, and I’m the \nonly one left who knows about the scar on my back. It doesn’t really look like a \ndaisy, more like a starburst, but it’s what the doctor said when I got it, so that’s \nhow I’ve always seen it. It makes me feel strong, to know that the soft \nnickname everyone calls me comes from a bloody wound. And I like to feel \nstrong. To be in control. \nDAISY \nI’m going to kill you, someday. \nELIAS (STATEMENT) \nWhen I was eleven, I had a best friend, and his name was Calvin Benchley. We \ndidn’t hang out at school much because his friends said I couldn’t play with \nthem because I was a girl. But every day after getting home we’d go to the \nnearby park and play. It was small, just a scrap of grass and dirt, but if you \nhopped the fence to the south you could get into the cemetery, and if you \nwent the other way you got into an old building site. The fence on that side \nwas broken and jagged, but it collapsed enough that it was easy to climb over \nit, into the half-built structure.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 2, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 4133}}
