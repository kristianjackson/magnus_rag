If anything it felt quite \npeaceful. The darkness seemed right for it, and the stones stood silent and \nfirm. I walked along the path, until my light fell across a small building. The \nchapel. It was tiny, surrounded by temporary fencing that looked like it had \nbeen there long enough to become permanent. It had a single, pointed bell \ntower, and the windows were covered with old boards that looked like they’d \nseen the worst of the rain. There was only a single entrance, a pair of double \ndoors set at the front. To my surprise, they stood open. I called out Natalie’s \nname, shouted and asked if anyone was in there, but there was only silence. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG025 – Growing Dark \n10 \n \nI shouldn’t have gone in. Of course I shouldn’t have gone in. I’m not that \nstupid. I’ve never been that stupid. But for some reason, standing there in that \ndark, empty cemetery, I made the decision to look inside. \nIt was easy to squeeze past the barriers. I still had my torch with me, but it \ndidn’t shine very far in. I entered slowly, casting my light over everything, just \nin case there were some hooded cultist freaks waiting to jump me, but there \nwere only old, broken pews, discarded bottles and cigarette ends. The normal \ndetritus any abandoned building collects. I was just about to turn around and \nleave… when my torch died. \nImmediately I was plunged into complete darkness. No light was coming in \nthrough the door. I couldn’t even see where the door was, everything around \nme was pitch black. I tried to get the torch to turn back on, turning the bulb \nand hitting it in a near panic. I tried to take the batteries out and put them \nback in, but I couldn’t see anything and I ended up fumbling and dropping \nthem. I knelt down and tried to feel where they were, but the ground felt… \nodd. I hadn’t paid much attention to it when I first came in, but the floor had \nbeen chipped, dusty and covered with a layer of junk. But… when I started to \nfeel around for the batteries, it felt smooth and clean and very cold, like \nmarble or something. \nI called out for help, but my voice just echoed in the silence. Then the singing \nstarted. It seemed like there were dozens of voices, but they didn’t match \ntogether right. Some were singing really high and others so low it made my \nteeth hurt. The words were in some other language, but I remember they kept \ncoming together for the words “Nee-allisand” or “allisunt”, I think. I was \nfreaking out, so I got to my feet and started to walk forward as fast as I was \nable, my hands stretched out in front of me in case I hit anything. The chapel \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG025 – Growing Dark \n11 \n \ncouldn’t have been more than thirty feet long, and maybe twenty wide, but I \nwalked for well over a minute without hitting anything. I just staggered \nthrough the complete darkness, with that awful singing everywhere. At one \npoint I honestly thought I might have died and gone to hell. \nFinally, my fingers brushed against something. It was cold, like the floor, but \nrough. It felt like rusted metal. Thin strips of rusted metal in a criss-cross \npattern, with small gaps between them. At least, that’s what it felt like. I didn’t \nhold on to them for very long, because as my hands rested there, I felt… \nfingers reach through the holes and try to grab me. I couldn’t see them, but \nthey felt leathery as they brushed against my skin. \nI screamed and leapt back, falling to the floor, and as I did so I felt something \nhard jab me in the hip. My phone. In all that had happened I had forgotten I \nhad it. I reached in and pressed the button and the screen lit up, faint and \nbarely visible, but I started crying like it was the first light I had seen in months. \nIt didn’t light up anything else, but as the singing began to crescendo I \ndesperately went to the torch function and turned it on. And it did turn on in a \nsudden flash of brilliance and the singing stopped. \nIn the silence I shone the makeshift torch in front of me and saw a broken pew. \nThe floor was once again covered in junk and I could see the doorway behind \nme, leading out into the night. I ran, calling Kathy first, and then the police. \nThey didn’t find anything, of course. They gave me a telling off about \ntrespassing and took down a missing person report about Natalie. Nothing was \nfound, and as far as I know she’s still gone.
