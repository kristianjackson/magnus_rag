And on top of that, sleeping peacefully among the \nfire, a baby: untouched, unharmed, and to our eyes alight with a burning \ndivinity. We baptised her with the boiling water of Asag and named her Agnes, \nas had been her mother’s final request. \nBut, raising a messiah, as it turns out, is a lot more challenging than creating \none. The sacrifices we fed Agnes worked fine, and maintaining her as a vessel \nof the Lightless Flame proved no real problem at all, but dealing with her as a \nchild was far tougher. She was quiet, considerate, but prone to fits of violent \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 139 – Chosen \n5 \n \nrage which, while not unexpected given what burned inside her, still made \nliving in a single location for any length of time untenable. She could not be \nallowed near other children for fear of discovery, could not be left alone for \nany significant length of time, and any who were not directly blessed were \noften unable to survive even an hour in her company. We even lost a few \nmembers whose blessings proved insufficient. Arthur tried to frame all this as a \ntest of faith, and declare those we lost raising Agnes had been found wanting \nin their devotion to the Lightless Flame. Prick. She was just a brat. \nEventually she began to settle down, to reach equilibrium and take her lessons \nmore to heart. She became studious, quiet, seemed to accept and \nacknowledge her destiny, her duties as our chosen one, and at times she even \nspoke dreamily of the Scoured Earth and the pain of the world to come. Her \nstrength was growing by the day, and even some of our most devout could not \ntouch her for more than a few seconds. \nThere was some division amongst us as the best course of action, something \nthat will surely not surprise you at this stage: some thought she needed to \nwalk among normal children, interact with those who saw her as one of them; \nsome thought she needed to continue training her focus; and some thought \nwe had waited long enough to strike at our enemies and she was powerful \nenough already. The compromise we came to was Hill Top Road. \nWe knew it was a stronghold of The Web, full of other children Agnes’ age. We \nwould supervise from a distance, but were confident she would be in no \ndanger. The Mother-of-Puppets has always suffered at our hand. All the \nmanipulation and subtle venom in the world means nothing against a pure and \nunrestrained force of destruction and ruin. We were right on that front, though \nif we’d known exactly how powerful The Web was in that place, perhaps we \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 139 – Chosen \n6 \n \nwould have reconsidered. I was not one of those assigned to watch our chosen \none, and so I can say little about exactly what happened within the walls of \nthat house, but it seems the fight scarred the place in a way far deeper than \nsimple fire. A scar in reality that I believe has since been compounded by the \ninterferences of other Powers. \nRegardless, the effect it had on Agnes was unanticipated. As far as we could \ntell she had destroyed the place utterly, and yet she remained bound to it, tied \nto it in some vital way. I knew when Arthur told me she had kept Raymond \nFielding’s hand that he was worried, but none of us could know what you were \ngoing to do. \nTruth be told, I don’t know what you actually did do. Neither Arthur nor Diego \nwould explain it to me in detail, and Jude simply flies into a rage when it’s \nbrought up. I assume it’s why we were waiting, biding our time for decades, \nunable to bring our designs to any culmination. Jude had only just joined at the \ntime, and was besotted with Agnes, though I couldn’t tell you if she loved her \nas a god or as a woman or as both. \nWhatever the situation, whatever you did, we were left paralysed. Unable to \ngo any further with our destiny and, I was assured, unable to remove the \nimpediment. \nSo we waited. Agnes had reached adulthood, but would age no further, so \nthere was no worry to that. Her fire would someday die, of course, but until \nthen it would neither fade nor dim. We did what we could: we found her a \nplace to live, gave her Jude for a guardian and provided for her material needs. \nAnd the years began to slowly burn away.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 2, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 4328}}
