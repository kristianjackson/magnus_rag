I had no idea what a small knife like that \nwould do against a creature that seemed far stronger and faster than me, but I \ndidn’t see any option other than to try. I moved so slowly as I reached for the \nknife that at times it seemed like I wasn’t moving at all. I was worried that the \ncreature would spot me and strike as it had with Nigel, although I now know \nthat smell is in fact the vampire’s major sense and, with all the blood around, \nthere was little chance of it detecting my scent. Grasping the knife in my \nhands, I crept over towards the creature as it placidly digested my brother’s \nlife, until I stood over it. I felt a sudden surge of rage and adrenaline come over \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG010 – Vampire Killer \n8 \n \nme and with a speed and strength I never knew I had, I plunged the knife into \nSylvia McDonald’s blood-bloated stomach. It burst like a sick balloon, and \nblood began to pour out. The creature’s eyes shot open and it clutched at the \nwound desperately. Its throat was not capable of uttering a scream but its face \ndisplayed a silent pain and anger as it flailed on the floor. Stumbling back, \ntrying to wipe the blood from my eyes, I felt an unexpected burning in my \nhand. I realised I’d touched the still-lit candle on the bedside table. I don’t \nknow what I expected to happen when I grabbed the candle and pressed it to \nthe dry part of Sylvia McDonald’s dress. I was just trying to find anything else I \ncould do to harm it before it could recover from its split belly, but I certainly \ndidn’t expect it to catch like dry tinder. The fire spread quickly over its \nrepulsive form, though it did slow somewhat where the clothing or flesh was \nstill moist with blood. It struck me that the vampire must be a very dry \ncreature when not fresh-fed and engorged. Perhaps I had struck before the \nliquid could spread throughout its body. \nWhatever the reason, Sylvia McDonald was alight, and to such a degree that \nthe rest of the room was starting to catch fire as well. I was distraught at the \nidea of leaving this house without my brother, but he was clearly dead and I \nneeded to escape. I recalled the vampire had been carrying a handbag when \nwe first met it, and had used a key from it to lock the front door. It did not \nhave the handbag with it now, though, so I began to desperately search the \nother rooms of the house, trying to find it. I did find it in the end, in what I \nassume to be the vampire’s bedroom. I’ll not describe it in detail, except to say \nthat it appears to be where the creature took most of its meals. Hopefully that \nmakes the picture clear enough for you. I found the key, though, and escaped \nthat house before the fire did me any serious damage.
