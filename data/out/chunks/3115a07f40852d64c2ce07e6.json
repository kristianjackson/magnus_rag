The face on \nthe monitor looked absolutely terrified, and I was starting to feel it myself. So, I \njust tried to smile, told him not to worry about it, and I headed out as quick as I \ncould. My legs were shaking so hard I almost fell on the way out. \nThen there were the actual cameras. I mean, you work in a shopping centre, \nobviously you do a bunch of shopping there. I used to get my lunch, for one, \nand usually pick up any of the essentials I needed. Sometimes, if I was feeling \nhard done by and it was payday, I might buy myself a new shirt or a game or \nsomething. And obviously, because I work security, I know where all the \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 148 – Extended Surveillance \n \n17 \n \ncameras are, where they cover, even how they move. A lot of them are \ncompletely static, just pointing at one place, but gradually I start to notice \nsomething when I’m shopping. It’s like a tickling, creeping sensation all over \nthe back of my neck. Like I’m being watched. And so, I start to keep an eye on \nthe cameras when I’m in the shops and, you know what, I’m right. They’re \nfollowing me. Whenever I look at them, doesn’t matter where it was they were \nmeant to be aimed, they’re always focused right on me. I keep staring at them, \nmoving around, and they just shift to keep the lens pointed at me. But they’re \nnot articulated – they don’t have any motor or swivel mount – they just move, \npointed right at me. \nOne time, when no-one in the store was looking, I threw a can of deodorant at \none of them, hit it square on. Samson wore sunglasses for the next two days, \nand when I caught a glimpse of him without them, there was a crack, right \ndown the centre of his eye. \nI tried to talk to the others. I’m pretty sure that they were getting similar \nweirdness from him. They were all jumpy and nervous those last few months. \nBut I was known around as Sam’s friend. We’d come in together and everyone \njust assumed we were close. When I started to ask about it, about what was \ngoing on, they just clammed up like I was trying to get them in trouble. My \nnerves were all shot to hell. \nI wasn’t in work the week he disappeared. I’d called in with a bullshit stomach \nthing. I just needed a break, some time to get my head right, and it was almost \nworking, you know? A little distance, a little space to relax, I was starting to \nfeel good. Then I got the call from Dave. \n \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 148 – Extended Surveillance \n \n18 \n \nHe was frantic. I couldn’t make out half of what he was saying over the bad \nline, but he kept saying Samson’s name, asking me if I knew, if he’d told me. I \nhad no idea what he was talking about, but he kept screaming at me. He kept \nsaying I must know; he must have told me what was going on. He kept saying, \n“What do we do with his eyes?” I mean, I didn’t know what the hell to say. I \njust went quiet, listening to Dave as he started sobbing down the phone. “He \nwon’t stop,” he said. “We can’t get rid of his face.” I hung up. \nDave was gone when I went back in, a bunch of them were – all quit suddenly. \nI wanted to check in with them, find out what happened, but we’d never really \nbeen friends, and I didn’t know any of their details. I never saw Samson again \neither, though I did find his old work shirt in the back. It was torn to shreds and \nwrapped around that old instruction manual. I put it back in the filing cabinet \nand I threw the shirt away. \nI tried to stick around, to do my job, but I was asking too many questions for \nthe folks upstairs, I think. I wanted to know why Samson hadn’t signed out of \nthe building before he disappeared, why no matter who tried to reset the \nsystem, it always logged back in as him. Or why, whenever I was watching the \nmonitors alone, I’d see him on that old CRT screen, staring right back at me, \nquietly calling for me to join him. \nARCHIVIST \nStatement ends. \nHmm. Better. Does reading a statement of the Ceaseless Watcher count as a \nsort of auto-cannibalism, I wonder? Or some sort of bird-like regurgitation of \nfear, re-consuming second-hand terror? Whatever the analogy, I’m finding it \nharder and harder to ignore the diminishing returns, how much less", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 6, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 4228}}
