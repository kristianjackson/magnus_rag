As I walked through, I \nbecame aware of a sound coming from the bed of the older burn victim. I \nnever did find out his name. I walked towards him slowly, straining my ears to \nhear what he was saying. It was so quiet as to be almost inaudible, but was \ndefinitely words, the same words over and over; the more I heard, the more it \nsounded like most of them weren’t in English. The first sounded like “Asak” or \n“Asag”, then “Veepalach” and finally in English “The lightless flame”. The last \npart was very clear, and I assumed he was talking about whatever burned him, \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG012 – First Aid \n6 \n \nbut he said it with such intensity that the words made me feel quite \nuncomfortable. His eyes were still closed and his lips were barely moving. I \nstarted to feel warm, like there was a fever quickly creeping out towards my \nskin. It wasn’t the first time I’d had a reaction like this, though, so I took a \nmoment to centre myself and the feeling receded. \nThe burned man was still whispering; I might even have called it chanting, and I \nwasn’t entirely sure what to do, so I checked his bandages to make sure they \ndidn’t need changing and left to go and continue my shift. If I saw Doctor Grice, \nwhich was more than likely, then I could tell her that our mystery burn victim \nhad started talking. Mostly I just wanted to get out of that room for as long as \npossible. \nIt was as I returned to the main Accident and Emergency reception that things \nstarted to get really strange. And by really strange, I mean that the reception \nwas completely empty. I don’t care how late it gets, and at this point it was \nnearly three in the morning, the waiting room for A&E is always full, especially \non a night like this. I mean, I’d been in there not five minutes before and there \nwere upwards of thirty people but now it was utterly deserted. Even the staff \nat the admissions desk were gone. I was freaked out, quite frankly, and started \nchecking through all the examination rooms, the wards next door and the \nindividual patient rooms. All empty, except for those patients physically too \nsick to move or hooked up to IVs. They lay there sleeping, and part of me \nwanted to wake them, just to hear the sound of another human being, to not \nbe alone, but like I say it was three in the morning and, weird as this all was, I \ncouldn’t justify waking up patients just to put my own mind at ease. I went as \nfar as to make as much noise as possible directly outside their rooms, but they \njust slept on.
