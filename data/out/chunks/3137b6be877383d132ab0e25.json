I mean, I’m sure she’s dead, but I don't… \nLet me start from the beginning. I work as a designer. Mainly freelance, with a \nfew more regular gigs with companies who like my work. I also have, well, had \nthe luxury of a flat I’d managed to get set up so I could do most of my work \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG006 – Squirm \n2 \n \nthere. This meant when I have a big job I spend quite a lot of time not leaving \nmy home. Not the most stable of employment but I got quite good at \nbalancing it so that after a big project I left myself a few days, or maybe even a \nweek, before I had to get started on the next one. I find it’s important that I \nuse this time to unwind and blow off a bit of steam, as when I’ve got work I \noften end up missing out on the regular weekend. Drinking and clubbing are \nmy relaxation methods of choice, usually down Camden or Old Street, and \nwhile I’ll admit I’m not above the occasional party drug I swear that I was stone \ncold sober when this all took place. \nThat night in particular, it was about three weeks ago now, I’d just finished a \nbig job for one of my more demanding clients and I wanted to get a bit \nwrecked. Unfortunately none of my friends were free to join me – not \nsurprising as it was a Thursday in the middle of November – so it didn’t feel \nworth heading all the way into the city. Luckily I live in Brixton, which means I \nhave a few decent options almost on my doorstep, and I happened to know \nthat the Dogstar ran a pretty decent club night on Thursdays. I decided to go \nalong and enjoy myself. \nI did enjoy myself in the end. Despite the crowds and the music, I wasn’t \nfeeling quite as wild as I expected but I drank a bit and danced plenty. Ok, \nmaybe I wasn't quite as sober as I said earlier but I certainly wouldn't have \ncalled myself drunk. Now, I wasn’t particularly looking to get laid that night, \nbut I know I’m not an unattractive guy and I live local, so I’m always alert, shall \nwe say, for any possibility of finding myself a partner. It was closing in on \nmidnight when I saw her. She was skinny and had that student look which \ncould have put her age anywhere between nineteen and twenty-eight.
