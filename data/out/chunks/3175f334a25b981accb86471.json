It's been left for me. \nDAISY \nAnd it says 'play me'. Kind of suspicious. \nBASIRA \nSo Elias left it. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 158 – Panopticon \n \n12 \nARCHIVIST \nOr Martin. Or Peter, or Annabelle! \nBASIRA \nFine. Whatever. Could be a distraction. \nARCHIVIST \nOnly one way to find out. \nBASIRA \nWe don't have time for this. \nDAISY \nWe don't know that. We've no idea what sort of time frame we're on. I say \nplay it. \nARCHIVIST \nThank you. \n[Tape clicks off] \n[Tape clicks on] \n[The sound of liquid being sloshed around; the Archivist’s office \ndoor swings open] \nELIAS \n(Further back) Gertrude. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 158 – Panopticon \n \n13 \nGERTRUDE \n(Close) (Under her breath) Damn. \nELIAS \n(Further back) Did you really think I wouldn't notice? \nGERTRUDE \nI'd rather hoped you'd still be hampered with all the Dark's business. \n[A slosh as Gertrude puts a container down; Elias enters the room] \nGERTRUDE (CONT’D) \nIt's their 'Grand Eclipse' at the moment, isn't it? \nELIAS \n(Affected sigh) But I think we've both come to the same conclusion about that. \nThat's why you're here. \nGERTRUDE \nYes. Shame, really. I used to be able to torch a building in half the time. (weary \nbreath) Age catches us all. (contemptuously) Well, almost all of us, Elias. \nELIAS \nYou were the one so... insistent on staying human. \nGERTRUDE \nAnd no doubt that makes my death a lot less complicated. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 158 – Panopticon \n \n14 \nELIAS \nWhat exactly were you hoping to achieve here? Why not come at me directly \ninstead of burning everything first? \nGERTRUDE \nI was rather hoping the fire would occupy you while I did just that. \nELIAS \nI see. \nHow long have you known? \nGERTRUDE \nAbout your body? Not long after you took your new host and we had that \nlittle... chat. Wasn't exactly a huge leap to the panopticon after that. The hard \npart was figuring out how to actually reach it. Took me the better part of a \ndecade. \nELIAS \nSo you burn the place down, use it as cover to reach my body, and then we die \ntogether. How poetic. Doesn't seem like your style at all. \nGERTRUDE \nI wasn't actually planning on dying. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 158 – Panopticon \n \n15 \nELIAS \nAnd how exactly were you planning on achieving that while you're still bound \nto the... ha. Oh, I see. Very clever. (smirk) I thought Eric was the only one to \nfigure that little morsel out. \nGERTRUDE \nKnowledge has a way of surviving. You of all people should know that. \nELIAS \nQuite. It was a good plan, actually. If you hadn't been so complacent about me \nkeeping an eye out down here, probably would have worked. (sarcastic) \nGertrude's grand retirement. \nGERTRUDE \nIt still might. \nJust needs a little spark, and— \n[Metal clink of a lighter, meanwhile a gun cocks] \nGERTRUDE (CONT’D) \nI see. So you're finally getting your hands dirty? I must really have caught you \noff guard. \nELIAS \nI suppose we both got a little complacent. Fifty years is a long time. End of an \nera. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 158 – Panopticon \n \n16 \nGERTRUDE \n(Disparagingly) I'm not really in the mood for nostalgia, Elias. You might have \nnoticed I'm rather busy so either shoot me or— \n[A gunshot rings out; Gertrude gasps and collapses] \nGERTRUDE \nWell... (gasp) there it is. (gasp) Thought it would hurt more. \n(Elias sighs) \nELIAS \nPity. \n[Tape clicks off] \n[Tape clicks on] \n[A quiet room] \nBASIRA \nRight, so what does that tell us? \nJohn? John? \nARCHIVIST \nY-yes, sorry, right. Just, uh... uh, the panopticon. It's the, um… \nBASIRA \nDesign of Millbank prison, based on an all-seeing watchtower. I know. I did the \nreading. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 158 – Panopticon \n \n17 \nARCHIVIST \nR-right. \nBASIRA \nYou think that's the device? \nARCHIVIST \nAh yes. And I'd wager that Elias' body— \nBASIRA \nGotta be Jonah Magnus, right? \nARCHIVIST \nI'd say so. \nBASIRA \n(Sigh) And he's been body hopping like whatever was in Reynor. \nARCHIVIST \nSo is he going to help Peter or-or stop him? \nBASIRA \nLukas is planning to take over the panopticon. Can't imagine he wants that to \nhappen. \nARCHIVIST \nBut Elias put him in charge. That doesn't make any— what... Daisy are you—? \n[Muffled sounds of violence]", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 2, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 4266}}
