The faces I knew and recognised \ngradually being outnumbered by young, trendy white people in artfully shabby \nclothes who thought they were blending in, and precise estate agents in well-\npressed suits taking pictures of dilapidated buildings. \nI complained, of course, made all the right noises of disapproval, but I still \ndrank the overpriced coffee, still shopped at the shiny new franchise outlets. I \nthought because I’d been living there so long, I’d be alright. Hell, the house had \nbeen my grandfather’s before he died. But we never had the money to actually \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 129 – Submerged \n7 \n \nbuy it, and as property values skyrocketed, the landlord, who’d always seemed \nso understanding, suddenly started itching to sell, and there was no way I \ncould afford the new rent on the meagre salary of my admin job. I looked into \ngetting roommates, subletting, all sorts, but by that point I was already too \ndeep in debt and there was just no way I was going to be able to stay. So I \nstarted the long and painful process of moving in with my sister. \nIt was... humiliating. The flat she lived in with her husband was much smaller \nthan the house and I couldn’t afford a storage unit, so much of what I owned, a \nlot of which had once belonged to my grandfather, had to be thrown away. We \nactually got into a blazing row over his old kukri. He had been a Gorkhali, \nserving in the 5th Gurkha Rifles during the Second World War. I have \ncomplicated feelings on his military history, of course, but he had always been \nfiercely proud of it, and that old knife had been one of his most treasured \npossessions. I didn’t keep it polished like he had, even at ninety years old, but \nit reminded me of him. \nI could see his calloused hand on its hilt as he meticulously, almost \nmechanically, cleaned it, humming a tune the name of which I never learned. \nHe had been a man of discipline, in many ways very harsh, but he had loved \nme and my sister very much, and the idea of throwing away his blade felt like a \nkick in my chest. In the end she agreed though, and it wasn’t long before I was \nspending my last nights in an almost abandoned house, shelves bare and \nwardrobes empty, trying my best to sleep on a mattress I knew I was leaving \nbehind. \nThe letter came the next day. The envelope was slightly damp, like it had been \ncarried through the rain, and it had my name printed on the front in a \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 129 – Submerged \n8 \n \nbusiness-like sans serif font. It looked at first like any other piece of financial \njunk mail you might glance at once and throw away, but I read it anyway. \nThe letter claimed to be from a financial firm named Eberhardt & Straus, at \nleast those were the names on the letterhead. The first words did nothing to \ndissuade me from my assumption it was junk mail: “Drowning it debt? We can \nhelp!” in big friendly text that seemed at odds with the pseudo-respectable \nimage the rest of it seemed to be striving for. But as I read through it, I realised \nthat, not only was it addressed to me specifically – not a difficult job for \nmodern batch-printing – but it made reference to some very specific aspects of \nmy situation: precise amounts of debt, names of creditors, and the sort of \ndetails that made it very clear that this was definitely written to me. It didn’t \ngive any indication of the exact assistance that Eberhardt & Straus were \nsupposedly offering, but it did give an address, and told me to call on them at \nmy convenience. At the bottom, in that same friendly typeface, it assured me, \n“We can help with the pressure!” \nI don’t know what I expected, I really don’t. What, they were just going to hand \nme ten grand and another four hundred a month to cover the rent increase? I \nmean, I knew about loan sharks and debt consolidation companies, and the \ndozens of other scams that prey on those in desperate situations like mine. \nThis was just going to be another of them. But the letter had been to me \nspecifically, and maybe, somewhere at the back of my mind, I was genuinely \nhoping for a way out. \nThe address they gave me was for a tall, thin building in Hammersmith that \nhoused about a half dozen law firms and a couple of tech start-ups. It didn’t \nlook like the sort of place that high-prestige businesses would have their \npremises, and more than one of the names listed on the", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 1, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 4500}}
