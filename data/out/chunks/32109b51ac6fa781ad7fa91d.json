The various ecological protection laws should mean that they \nhad virtually none of either, and he was looking into something to do with \npollutant transmission and chemical spread from industrial sites. If it hadn’t \nbeen for the standard NDAs they were always getting us to sign, I could have \nalready told him the sort of results he was going to get – he wasn’t the first to \ncome here for this kind of work – but my hands were tied. If you’re wondering, \nby the way, the answer is pretty damn polluted, largely due to various illegal \nmining and logging operations and land seizure in the area. The point is, we \nwere barely an hour into the trek, when the skies opened. \n \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 149 – Concrete Jungle \n5 \n \nThe rain came down thick, thick in that way that I’ve only ever found in the \njungle, where there aren’t really droplets, it’s more like the air just turns to \nwater. Visibility went down to nothing immediately, and I started to talk \nquickly to Fernanda about whether we could make it back or where we might \nbe able to shelter. The rain was bad, but we’d handled worse and we were \nperfectly calm. Not so much Dr Anastas, who was clearly panicking. He shouted \nat us, yelling over the sounds of the rain-soaked jungle that we had to go back, \nbefore immediately charging off in the wrong direction. \nObviously, we wanted to leave him to his own stupidity and let the Amazon \ndeal with him, but we both knew that it just wouldn’t be worth the paperwork. \nSo, we followed him, trying to slow his pace long enough to let him know that \nhe was going the wrong way, but either he couldn’t hear us or, more likely, he \nwasn’t inclined to listen. Finally, I grabbed his arm, pulling him to a stop. He \nsaid something I couldn't make out and pulled back, trying to throw off my \ngrip. Clearly, he hadn’t considered I’d be the stronger, and when my grip held \nfirm, he unbalanced himself. He shifted his leg, trying to keep his footing, but \nslipped on the now muddy ground, falling and pulling me with him. I \ninstinctively grabbed Fernanda for support, but ended up pulling her down as \nwell, the three of us tumbling down a short, muddy decline and landing hard in \nthe foliage. \nIt took a few moments to pull ourselves together. It wasn’t a huge fall, but I felt \nstrangely disorientated, as I clambered to my feet, shaking my head in an \nattempt to dispel some of the fuzziness that had settled over it. The others \nclearly felt it too, although checking ourselves over it seemed we’d been lucky: \nall we had broken was our equipment, although Dr Anastas whined about that \nalmost as much as if it had been a bone.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 2, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 2730}}
