She never hired \nanother. She worked with those that seemed useful until they were no longer \nso — Leitner. Dekker. Keay. Even Salesa on occasion. But she never again \nallowed herself to trust. \n(Beat) \nI, I, I'm sorry; I-I didn't, um— \nMARTIN \nOh, no, it's, uh, it's okay. (cough) I just, I couldn't… not listen, or interrupt. Or— \nARCHIVIST \nI, I, I promise, I, I didn't know I was going to do that. \nMARTIN \nI, I understand. \n(Sigh) Well, let's... try to avoid that next time. (little laugh) \nARCHIVIST \nYes, quite. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 167 – Curiosity \n17 \n(Martin sighs through puffed cheeks) \nMARTIN \nSo. What? Without assistants she'd be bad at the apocalypse? \nARCHIVIST \nW-without trust. W-without a-a reason. \nGertrude needed both the purpose her mission gave her and the control her \nposition allowed. To be here, like us, without a, a reason, without someone to \nground her? She-she'd have power, but, no control. No real purpose. \nPerhaps she'd d-dedicate herself to a-a d-doomed quest like us but… \n(Quieter) No. I think this would have broken her. And she'd have resigned \nherself to, ruling her domain. \nMARTIN \nWhat domain? \nARCHIVIST \nWe all have a domain here, Martin. The place that feeds us. \nMARTIN \nOh. \nWhere's yours? \nARCHIVIST \n(Laugh) I mean we're… traveling towards it. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 167 – Curiosity \n18 \nMARTIN \nOh. Right, obviously. (small laugh) Duh. Um, what about me? \nARCHIVIST \n(Cautiously) Would you, like me to— \nMARTIN \n(Quick) No, no. Don't tell me. I don't want to know. \nARCHIVIST \nOkay. \nMARTIN \n(Coy) So. If you say Gertrude wouldn't have been able to go on without a \nreason— \nARCHIVIST \n(Fondly conceding) Yes, Martin, you are my reason. \nMARTIN \nJust wanted to make you say it! \n(Beat) \nCool. \nARCHIVIST \nRight. Shall we press on? \n[Jangling zippers and gritty footsteps as they stand up] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 167 – Curiosity \n19 \nMARTIN \nOh, ju-, uh, just, uh… before we do. \nARCHIVIST \nMm? \nMARTIN \nA moment ago, when you were talking. \nARCHIVIST \nRight. \nMARTIN \nThe old Archivist, Angus. \n(The Archivist inhales) \nYou said Fiona was… \n(The Archivist sighs) \n…released when he died. \nARCHIVIST \nYes. \nMARTIN \nIf you had died, would the others have been able to quit? \nARCHIVIST \nYes. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 167 – Curiosity \n20 \nI didn't know. \nMARTIN \nIf you had, would you have told them? Would that have, have changed what \nhappened? \nARCHIVIST \n(Sigh) I don't know, Martin. I… \nI don't know. \n[They start walking] \n[Tape clicks off] \n[The Magnus Archives Theme – Outro] \nJONATHAN SIMS \nThe Magnus Archives is a podcast distributed by Rusty Quill and licensed under \na Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial ShareAlike 4.0 International \nLicence.
