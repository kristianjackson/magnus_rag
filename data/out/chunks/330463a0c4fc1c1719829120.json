I slept \nthen, fitfully and in great pain, and when I woke back up to find myself still \ntrapped there, I cried. Even as I did so, in the back of my mind I hated myself \nfor wasting what water I might have left in me. \nFour days I was in there, at least, if the darkness and light really was night and \nday. I used to be religious and I tried to pray several times, but the words felt \nhollow on my dry, desperate lips. I called out to God, then later to the devil \nand finally to Salesa himself. None of them answered. I knew that that was \nwhere I was going to die, trapped and alone. I wondered if they would ever \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 066 – Held in Customs \n \n8 \n \nfind me. Was I somewhere where the stench of my rot might bring some poor \nsoul to investigate? Probably not, if my screams couldn’t be heard, but maybe \nsomeone would find me. Maybe they would join me, if the box was still \nhungry. \nIt was thoughts like these that played endlessly through my mind, round and \nround like a feverish, thirsty carousel. \nThen all at once it was over. I awoke to hear the sounds of wood shifting above \nme. I barely had time to register what was happening, before frigid, icy air \nwashed over me and the torchlight was shining in my face. I blinked hard as I \nstarted to make out two figures above me. One was Salesa, staring at me with \nan expression of curiosity. The other I didn’t know, though I vaguely recognised \nhim as one of the captains that made port here occasionally. Captain Laurell, \nmaybe? Or Luckor? I don’t really remember. He looked at me, then over to \nSalesa, shrugged, then handed him a £20 note, before turning around and \nwalking out of the shipping container, which I saw I was once again inside. \nSalesa lifted me gently out of the box, being careful, I noted, not to touch the \nsides. Moving my legs was like walking on knives, but I managed to stumble \nout, overjoyed at my freedom. I felt Salesa push some papers into my hands, \n“An updated manifest”, he told me, and sent me on my way. \nI spent that day trying to get some life back into my tortured, atrophied \nmuscles and slowly drinking water. I ignored my work completely and ended \nthe day by handing in my notice. Do you know what date was on my letter of \nresignation? The 19th of January, the day after I had first seen Salesa. My \nwatch no longer matched the clock in the break room. \n \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 066 – Held in Customs \n \n9 \n \nI don’t know why the night was so much longer for me, or why it boiled me \nwith the sun in the middle of winter. I must have been drugged. Salesa must \nhave drugged me. It’s the only rational explanation. But I know that he didn’t. \nARCHIVIST \nStatement ends. \nAnother tale of the elusive Mikaele Salesa, dealing in all sorts of artefacts \nwithout any decent safety measures. Unless that’s the point, of course. And if \nI’m not mistaken, it would appear he’s at least acquainted with Captain Peter \nLukas of The Tundra. Whatever this grand game is, Salesa is definitely involved. \nI just wish I knew whether he was a player or a pawn. Or something else \nentirely. \nSurprisingly, it seems comprehensive shipping records are harder for Tim to \nflirt his way into than police reports and Sasha has had her own issues with \ntrying to access the electronic records. If there is official documentation of this \nparticular shipment that might verify Mr Yang’s story, we’re not able to obtain \nthem. \nMartin encountered a different problem tracking down Mr Yang himself. \nApparently, he’s retired now and living with his children, who were surprisingly \ncooperative in allowing Martin to see him. He’s also in the later stages of early \nonset Alzheimer’s disease. He could provide no new useful information and \nMartin left after Mr Yang became acutely distressed at the mention of boxes. \nAll in all, a dead end. If this was the first time Mikaele Salesa had turned up in \nour files, I would definitely agree with Mr Yang’s own assessment.
