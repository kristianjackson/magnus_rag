Apparently they were staying in West \nPullman, Chicago. At least, they were when Gertrude requested the \nstatements forwarded on to them. I’m going to get a hotel and follow up the \naddress tomorrow. I wouldn’t normally bother recording here, but I think... I \nthought I was being followed. I might just be jumpy. I’ll keep my eyes peeled. \n \n(Click) \n \n(Click) \n \nARCHIVIST \nThe address didn’t really pan out. The place deals in short-term rentals, and a \ndozen people must have gone through that apartment since Gertrude and \nGerard stayed there. The owner did remember her, “That old Brit and her \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG107 – Third Degree \n \n2 \n \nson”, but he said anything they left behind was either sold or thrown out. They \ndid leave a forwarding address of sorts – anything that came was to be sent on \nto the Usher Foundation in Washington D.C., who I assume would send it on to \nthe Magnus Institute. I asked him about circuses around at the time, and he \nsaid he didn’t remember there being one about, but a few nights while \nGertrude was there, he had heard “music like one of those little organs” \ncoming from West Pullman Park. \n \nI’m planning to make the journey down to Washington in the hopes that \nGertrude might have visited the Usher Foundation. According to our earlier \nemails they don’t have any record of it on file, but … I did notice however that \none of the Greyhound routes there goes through Pittsburgh. According to the \ndetails Melanie retrieved a few months back, Pittsburgh is where Gerard Keay \nallegedly died. He was admitted to UPMC Presbyterian Emergency \nDepartment, having suffered a massive seizure, and died less than a day later. I \nthink I might have to pay a visit and ask around. \n \nAlso, I’m definitely being followed. There’s a police officer. I saw him at the \nairport as well. He stood out a bit, because he wasn’t immigration or TSA or \nanything like that. He just, he just looked like a Chicago beat cop. Well, I saw \nhim again today, and I’m pretty sure he was watching me. \n \n(Click) \n \n(Click) \n \n(Faint television heard through wall) \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG107 – Third Degree \n \n3 \n \n \nARCHIVIST \n(Sighs) The hospital was, uh... interesting. It’s all very well being able to get \npeople to answer your questions, but if they genuinely don’t remember \nsomething, it’s not always as useful as it seems. I only found only one person, \nLewis Brown, a nurse, who recalls working the night Gerard Keay was \nadmitted. His “mother” was with him, and I almost feel like Gertrude took a \nperverse joy in the pretence. She explained his condition to the doctor, though \ncould apparently offer no good reason he wasn’t in full time treatment, as his \ncancer was by this point very advanced. They did everything they could to save \nhim, but he had a second seizure shortly after he was admitted and there was \nnothing they could do. Unless he was somehow able to lie to me, this nurse, \nLewis, honestly believes Gerard Keay is dead. Maybe I came all this way for \nnothing. \n \nThere’s one thing I do very much need to follow up though. Apparently, \nGertrude was arrested shortly afterwards. Lewis only heard about this second \nhand, but she was, apparently, caught breaking in to the morgue where \nGerard’s body was being kept. I need some sleep. I haven’t seen the cop since I \nleft Chicago, so maybe I was wrong. I’m not feeling so good. \n \n(Click) \n \n(Click) \n \nARCHIVIST", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 0, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 3869}}
