Maybe she just didn't find my \njokes funny. Who knows? She was religious, too. I've never had much time for \nGod, myself, and Kathy didn't either. That's why I was kind of surprised the first \ntime I visited her new place and found a framed Bible quote on the wall. Can't \nremember what it was. Something about Jesus and faith, I don't really know \nBible stuff. Kathy said it was Natalie's. She didn't mind her putting it up there in \nthe living room. Kathy's nice like that, you know? Just letting people be \nthemselves. \nMe and Natalie… didn't get on. I don't know if you picked up on that. We didn't \nhate each other or anything like that, we just… didn't have anything in \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG025 – Growing Dark \n3 \n \ncommon. She didn't really watch TV or movies, and I didn't know anything \nabout crochet, politics or God, which were pretty much her only interests. \nKathy was always trying to get her to come out with us, and she'd just say no, \nwhich was fine by me. She always seemed happy enough, though, hooking \nyarn into whatever she was making at the time, reading some boring book on \nthe political history of the bonnet or something. \nThat changed last October, when Natalie's mum died. I don't know how it \nhappened, exactly. Heart failure, I think. It was sudden, I know that much, and \nit hit her hard. I mean, obviously it did, it was her mum, but I think… I think she \nlost her faith. The Bible quote wasn't on the wall the next time I went over, and \nwhen I asked Kathy about it she gave me a look like I shouldn't bring it up. I \ndidn't see much of Natalie after that. She was still around, I'd sometimes see \nher heading into the kitchen to get some food or tea or something, but apart \nfrom that she just stayed in her room. \nSo far, so normal, right? You lose your mum and it messes you up. That month \nwas sad, but it's not what Kathy wanted us to talk to you about. No, it was \nwhat happened afterwards. It was after Natalie found her new church. It was \nKathy who told me about it. This must have been about two months after \nNatalie's mum died. I must have asked how she was doing, if she was feeling \nany better. Kathy said that, yeah she was. Apparently, she'd found a new \ncongregation and seemed to be getting some comfort there. She hadn't been \ncrying so much at night, Kathy said, and hadn't been quite as prickly when she \ntried to talk. I noticed that the Bible quote hadn't gone back up, though. \nI thought if she was doing better I'd probably see Natalie around more when I \nstayed with Kathy, but if anything she seemed to almost completely disappear. \nShe never seemed to be there when I went over. I'd see her leave in the \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG025 – Growing Dark \n4 \n \nevening and come home early in the morning, just as the sky was starting to \nget light. She'd go straight into her room, ignoring us completely. When I asked \nher where she'd been one time, she just told me “church”. I asked her a few \nmore questions, but she stared at me in this weird way until I got freaked out \nand left the room. I joked with Kathy that her flatmate was turning into a \nvampire, but instead of laughing she just got defensive and said that Natalie \ncouldn't be a vampire. Then she started listing times she'd seen her in the \nsunlight, before just kind of trailing off. I think we both realised how messed up \nit was if she could list the number of times she'd seen Natalie in daylight. Other \nstrange stuff began to happen around the flat as well. The light bulbs kept \nblowing, to begin with. Well, that's not entirely true. It always seemed to be \nthat when we got in after dark, we'd try to turn on the lights and, well, nothing \nwould happen. At first we just threw the old bulbs out and replaced them, but \nit kept happening. We checked the fuses, the sockets, Kathy even called the \nlandlord to have someone check out the wiring, but it all seemed fine. The \nlights kept not working, though. Then I had a thought. The next time it \nhappened, instead of changing the light bulb, I just tightened it. Just like that it \nturned back on. The first time this happened I was so surprised I nearly fell off \nthe chair I was stood on. The bulbs hadn't been breaking, someone had been \nunscrewing them. Not much, not enough that we could spot it, just enough for \nthem to not work. I say ‘someone’ had been doing this, but there was only one \nperson it could have been. For some reason, Natalie had been unscrewing all \nthe lightbul", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 1, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 4500}}
