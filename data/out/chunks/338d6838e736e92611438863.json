We all lived with monsters in the shadows, and we \njust got on with it. \nBASIRA \nYeah, until we didn’t, until the ritual kicked off. What’s to stop the same thing \nhappening in these other worlds? \nMARTIN \nIt, it took like millennia of failed rituals before this happened. That means there \nhas to be a chance that it won’t happen at all, right? \n[Georgie’s chair creaks] \nGEORGIE \nMaybe. \nMELANIE \nAnd if it does happen, it will be because of the actions of the people in those \nother dimensions, just like here it was because of— \nARCHIVIST \nMe. \nMELANIE \nBecause of us. \n(Beat) \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 199 – Seeing it Through \n13 \nMy point is that we can’t take responsibility for the hypothetical actions of \nhypothetical people in all these other universes. \nFundamentally, the Fears travelling to these other places isn’t a death \nsentence. And even if the worst happens they might just find themselves in \nexactly the same situation as us, deciding whether to pass it all along again. \nMARTIN \nLike, the worst chain letter ever. \nMELANIE \nExactly. Probably have their own Panopticon, their own Archivists. \nMARTIN \n(Shudders) Their own Martin. \nMELANIE \nIf they’re unlucky. Heh. \nMARTIN \nOh, ha ha. \nARCHIVIST \nBut the point is, we have a chance to stop all that. We, we don’t have to post \nthe letter. We can keep them contained, a-and even eventually destroy them. \nGEORGIE \nCan we? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 199 – Seeing it Through \n14 \nMARTIN \nWhat do you mean? \nGEORGIE \nWell... Did Annabelle say for certain that this dimension is where they were, \num… ‘born’, I guess? \nARCHIVIST \nNo. No, the Eye can’t see its own creation so... I don’t actually know how they \ncame to be. Perhaps we can’t know. \nGEORGIE \nSo, how can we be sure they didn’t come through to our reality in exactly this \nway? Maybe we’re just another link in a long chain of these things spreading \nfrom one dimension to the other, growing at the edges, manifesting, and then \nescaping to somewhere new. \nMARTIN \nLike weeds. \nBASIRA \nOr a fungus. \nARCHIVIST \nSure, but even if that was true, it doesn’t change the situation. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 199 – Seeing it Through \n15 \nBASIRA \nYes it does. If it’s a choice between stopping the Fears completely, destroying \nthem once and for all, here and now, or just being one universe they don’t \nescape among potentially infinite ones where they do... Those are very \ndifferent scenarios. \n[Basira takes a step] \nBASIRA (CONT’D) \nThey are to me at least. \nARCHIVIST \nWe don’t know. And even if we hunted Annabelle down, and squeezed more \ninformation out of her, I don’t think she knows either. We simply don’t have \nthat information, and we can’t just arbitrarily decide what’s true just because it \nmakes the choice easier for us. \nMARTIN \nAnd you can’t just arbitrarily decide it isn’t, because you want a better reason \nto martyr yourself! \nARCHIVIST \nThat’s not what’s happening! \nMARTIN \nIsn’t it? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 199 – Seeing it Through \n16 \nMELANIE \nEither way it’s not an unreasonable conclusion. It’s just as likely as this \ndimension being where they were born. I-It’s more likely, even, which means \nwe’d be condemning everyone for no reason. \nARCHIVIST \nHardly “no reason”. And let’s be honest for a second, you just want an excuse \nto stick a knife in Jonah Magnus. \nGEORGIE \nJohn! \nMELANIE \nNo, he’s got a point. I want that smug bastard dead, and if I got a chance to do \nit myself you can bet I would do it in a heartbeat. But if you think that’s all I \ncare about here, then frankly you can fuck off out my tunnels on your high \nhorse. \n(Beat) \n[Melanie’s folded cane gently clicks as she untenses] \nMARTIN \nI, I can’t just hang around, and watch the whole world linger like this on the \noff-chance that it might do some small good somewhere else. \nARCHIVIST \nMaybe it doesn’t have to linger.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 2, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 3977}}
