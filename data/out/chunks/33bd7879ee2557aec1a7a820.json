SPIDER DOESN’T EAT FLOWERS’, \nthe next page announces, and Mrs. Fruit is gone, the door closed again. \nThe right-hand door is more noticeably stained now; the once-black ink now \nseems like a dark, crusty brown at the hinges and the seams. The flowers \nbrought by the doomed fruit fly now stand on the table, but they are more \nclearly wilted and stained a deep, vivid red. Mr. Spider’s abdomen is engorged \nand straining, and where his mouth would be is marked by the same dried \nbrown colour as the door. His arms are moving once again. \nOn the messier page, with more colour to contrast it, I can see that his hands \naren’t empty, but are weaving and pulling on thin grey threads, that stretch all \naround the room, and out through the cracks in both doors. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG081 – A Guest for Mr Spider \n8 \n \n‘KNOCK KNOCK. WHO IS IT, MR. SPIDER?’ Behind the door stands a large, burly \nfly, this one dressed in baggy overalls. Next to it stands a much smaller fly, \ndressed in what appears to be a child’s version of those same overalls. They \nare both openly weeping. ‘IT’S MR. HORSE. AND HE’S BROUGHT YOU HIS SON’. \nThe close-up on that fly’s face is an image that still comes to me when I’m \nhaving trouble sleeping. Then the text: ‘MR. SPIDER WANTS MORE.’ \nWhen we go back to the picture of the empty parlour it’s smeared all over with \ndark reds and browns. Mr. Spider’s abdomen now dwarfs the rest of him and \nseeps a sticky red, along with the now clearly visible grey thread. He has \nturned to face the reader. Staring into me as his arms move and move and \nmove. \nThe second-to-last page shows the right-hand door up close, the stains and the \nink seeping from the edges. It looks like it has a cut-away panel that can be \nopened onto the final page. ‘MR. SPIDER WANTS ANOTHER GUEST FOR \nDINNER’ it reads, ‘IT IS POLITE TO KNOCK’. I feel my hand closing into a fist and \nreaching for the door, preparing to rap my knuckles on the grimy old wood. \nIt was at that moment that a hand far bigger than my own slapped the book \nfrom my grip, before shoving me hard in the chest and sending me sprawling \nonto the floor. I was in the park a few roads away from my house. Had I taken \nthe book there to read? Or did I somehow wander there while engrossed in it? \nTo this day I don’t know, but I was in the park, and standing over me was… you \nknow, for the life of me I can’t remember his name. Thomas, maybe? Daniel? I \nalmost want to say Michael, but that isn’t it. He saved my life, and I can’t \nremember his name. Why does your memory do that to so many important \npeople? Some people deserve to be remembered. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG081 – A Guest for Mr Spider \n9 \n \nHe was a bully. Eighteen or nineteen, I think. He helped my grandmother with \nodd jobs sometimes, just a bit of cash-in-hand work, but he had always taken a \ndislike to me. At the time I had convinced myself that it was because of how \nsmart I was, since he was, to put it charitably, not very clever, but I have since \ncome to the conclusion that I was a deeply annoying child. Still, he was more \nthan twice my age, so I’m certainly not excusing his decision to torment me \nwhenever he got the chance. Name-calling, the odd beating, sometimes \nstealing from me – all very standard. He just made the extremely poor choice \nto do it at that exact moment. \nMy tormentor bent down and picked up what he had slapped out of my hands \nand examined the book. I was too dazed to protest, and he started to mock \n“little Einstein” for reading “a kiddie book”. But as he did so, he flicked through \nit, and as his eyes passed over more and more of the page, the words tailed \noff, and he seemed to be reading it himself. His hands shook ever so slightly as \nhe slowly made his way through it, and his legs began to move. It was jerky and \nunsteady, and he didn’t seem to notice that he was doing it. \nI had no idea what was going on, not really, but I was somehow desperate to \nget that book back. He was much bigger than me, though, so all I could do was \nfollow as he walked down alleys and side streets. There were fewer and fewer \npeople about, and I realised with a start that I had failed to notice nightfall. At \nthe far end of a quiet residential road, he walked up to one of the houses. I \nnever found it again, and for all I knew it might have actually been his house. \nHe was still reading. When he reached the entrance, he held up the book and \nplaced it on the front door.
