I guess the end of the world must’ve left me all snappy. \nMARTIN \nWell… I mean, y— \nMELANIE \nDon’t. Don’t say it. I actually did a lot of work on my anger, you know? Tried to \nput all the supernatural bollocks behind me. And now my therapist thinks I’m \n‘the chosen one’. \nMARTIN \nYeah, the apocalypse does seem to bring out the weird in people. \n(Melanie makes a sound of assent) \nMELANIE \nSpeaking of... uh, you and John, eh? \nMARTIN \nHmm? \n(Martin makes some small assent and chuckling noises) \nMELANIE \nCongrats, took you long enough. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 190 – Scavengers \n \n21 \nMARTIN \nOh god! I totally forgot I haven’t even seen you since… well... \nMELANIE \nYeah. Not… not since before John woke up. \nBefore you, uh… cut yourself off. \nMARTIN \nYeah, sorry about that. \nMELANIE \nLook, I, I get it. I was still full of ghost bullet at the time, remember? \nMARTIN \nOh yeah. I suppose, when you think about— I mean... Do we actually know \neach other? Really? \nMELANIE \nHuh. \nUh, Melanie. \n[Reaches out for a handshake, which is reciprocated] \nMARTIN \nMartin. \n(Playfully) So… what do you do? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 190 – Scavengers \n \n22 \nMELANIE \n(Playing along) Oh, um… (chuckle) I’m ah actually one of the prophets chosen \nto walk the end times unscathed. \nMARTIN \nMmm. Mmm. \nMELANIE \nYourself? \nMARTIN \nOh, I’m the Antichrist’s plus one. \n(Melanie chortles) \nMELANIE \nOh, that… that sounds like a rough gig. \nMARTIN \n(Smiling) It has its perks. \nSeriously though, how the hell did you and Georgie fall into the ‘prophet’ \nthing? \n(Melanie sighs) \nMELANIE \nOkay, um… It wasn’t exactly a choice. It just turns out that since I… severed my \nconnection with The Eye, y’know, ah and Georgie has no fear, we’re kind of... \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 190 – Scavengers \n \n23 \ninvisible? To all the nonsense out there. We only realised when we finally went \nout to see what was going on and… saw how bad it was... \nMARTIN \nYeah. It’s the same outside London. Worse, in some places. Though I guess \nthat’s down to personal taste these days. \nMELANIE \nYeah. \nWell, we were, we were out, and we found this Spiral maze, uh, and who did \nwe find inside but Laverne, my therapist. I wasn’t exactly going to leave her \nthere so, we grabbed her and legged it. And… that’s when we discovered that \nwe can keep others hidden as well. \nMARTIN \nHm. \nMELANIE \nNot completely and, and not for long, but it’s enough to get them here to the \ntunnels. So once we realised that, we started doing it for more people. \n…Have you had to explain any of this stuff to somebody who just doesn’t have \nthe first clue about any of it? \nMARTIN \nNot often. And it never went great. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 190 – Scavengers \n \n24 \nMELANIE \nYeah, well, tell you what, you sound like a doomsday-ing tarot reader. \nHours talking about The Eye’s ‘ascendance’, and how it’s, y’know, transforming \nthe world into a fearful ‘psychoscape’ and... \nMARTIN \nThey didn’t believe you? \nMELANIE \nOh, I wish, y’know No; they believed us, but a few of them took it in a bit more \nof a... religious direction. And here we are. \nMARTIN \nMmmm. Okay but I still don’t get the whole ‘prophet’ business — what exactly \nare you meant to have predicted? \n(A heavy sigh from Melanie) \nMELANIE \nOkay, um…I… (sigh) I said I’d had a vision that it would end. \nMARTIN \nOh. Right. And er… have you had a vision or… \n…Right. \nMELANIE \nLook, I know, alright. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 190 – Scavengers \n \n25 \n(Sigh) It was a shitty thing to do, but... if you had heard how, how hopeless \nthey all were, like, when we told them all this. That everyone is trapped in, like, \nnever-ending torment, forever... I had to tell them something. \nMARTIN \nI guess. \nMELANIE \nI hate it. They just keep trying to interpret everything I do. And they keep \ncalling me “The Blind Prophet”, which is a whole other thing! \nMARTIN \nEr, yikes. \nMELANIE \nYeah, uh-huh! \n(Sigh) It’s why we head out so much. Sometimes we actually are scouting or \ngathering, but half the time... I just need to get away. \n[Several clinks from Melanie’s folded cane] \nMELANIE (CONT’D) \nIf I didn’t have Georgie, I think I might just snap and beat them all to death. \nMARTIN \nSounds like they’d probably just thank you for your wisdom, if you did that.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 3, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 4428}}
