He would show us… the love of ‘Choke’. \nI still couldn’t see anything, but I felt his hand on my face, hot and dry and \nrough, and I tried to scream, but it just let in more dust. Harry did scream, \nthough, and I could hear a struggle going on beside me, grunts and the sounds \nof flesh striking soil, then the sound of a car door opening, and the sudden rush \nof wind and grit. And then it closed abruptly, and I once again sat in the \nunmoving quiet of the car. Except this time, I was alone. \nI never saw Harry Eisenhard again. When the storm finally passed, I spent \nhours searching for him, but he was gone. I did find the body of Stefan, though, \n\nabout twenty yards away, so encrusted with dirt he barely looked human \nanymore. Black Sunday, they called that storm, and \nHarry was a long way from its only casualty. He got lost in the shuffle, officially \nmourned by the staff of the Associated Press, and then never discussed again. I \nwish I could say more about him, but honestly, I hadn’t worked with the man \nvery much. All I know is that he was taken by Stefan Brotchen, and that it \nhappened after Brotchen was dead. When all that made him human was \nsuffocated, and the only thing left to move and speak inside him was that \nterrible killing dust. \nGERTRUDE \n(Sighs) Hmm. Final comments. \nBased on the history of Boise City and its deceptive roots, I would perhaps \nhave expected some aspect of the Spiral to be at work here, but its unique \nposition at the centre of the Dust Bowl does seem heavily to indicate another \npower overtly at work. I have had my suspicions about where to be focusing \nmy efforts, and the nature of the pseudo-prophecies given by the dust inside \nStefan Brotchen seems to confirm them. To that end, I’ve been examining fault \nlines and seismic data for— \n[Knocking on door] \n(Gertrude groans.) \nGERTRUDE \n(Adopts a somewhat frailer voice) Hello? \n[Door opens] \n\nMICHAEL \nAh, Miss Robinson, I, um, I found Mr. Vargas’ statement that you asked for. \nWell, uh, I found the translation. I, I already had the original but, y’know, I, I, I \ndidn’t think you’d want it in Spanish. (Nervous chuckles) U-U-Unless you speak \nSpanish? \nGERTRUDE \n(Somewhat sharply) I do not. And thank you Michael. \nMICHAEL \nSure. Um, well, was, was there anything else you needed? \nGERTRUDE \nUm… No, no. Not at the moment. Thank you. \nGERTRUDE \nRight, well, if you need me, uh, they’re installing that climate-controlled \nstorage… that thing o-oover the weekend, so I’m, I’m, y’know, I’m just getting \nall that together. \nGERTRUDE \nYes! Yes, I remember. \nMICHAEL \nRight. Well, call me if you need anything. \nGERTRUDE \n\nThank you, Michael, I will. \n[Door closes] \n(Normal voiced) Right. These additional researches have further cemented my \nbelief that North America is going to be the focal point for the Buried. Now it’s \njust a matter of narrowing down the specifics of geography, and that may just \ncome down to monitoring the right movement of supplies and people. I’m still \nnot completely sold on the US for the Hunt, but that’s unlikely to be quite as \nurgent. For the Buried, however, I do have what I believe might be quite an \neffective plan forming. Assuming, of course, that my suspicions about Jan \nKilbride are correct, and that’s something that should be easy enough to \ndetermine once he’s back on Earth. Considering what’s probably happened to \nhim up there already, I feel almost… bad, but there’s ten years yet before I can \nafford a conscience. \n[Tape clicks off. Tape clicks on.] \nARCHIVIST \nI, um… I… Right. Right, I— My head is... That was Michael. It-It was… It was \nMichael. H-how… How was it Michael? He— It... It never… Gertrude knew \nMichael. He was one of her assistants, but, but, but that doesn’t make any \nsense. \nThe thing that calls itself Michael, it-it-it doesn’t seem like it was ever human. \nSo what happened to the real Michael? Did— I mean that’s not really a \nquestion, is it? He’s dead, and it’s probably because of Gertrude. I still can’t \nfigure out whose side she was actually on. Or even if she was playing the same \ngame. Doesn’t matter. Everyone who came close to her… seems like it… it", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 3, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 4198}}
