But down there in \nthe dark and icy ground, Sam still clings hard to his dream of the Sun, and the \nground lets him, of course, for what true fear can exist without hope, without \nthe belief that things might change for the better? To tug at the knowledge \nthat they will only get worse? \nWhen he has the will, when the cold soil around him has been still and silent \nfor long enough, Sam may once again begin his grim and painful climb. Moving, \nsquirming along by the merest fractions of a millimetre afforded by his \npressing prison, he claws and digs in what might have once been fingers. The \nsoft earth is always keen to slip away, but sometimes, just sometimes, the tips \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 166 – The Worms \n13 \nof those extremities find purchase, and he pulls himself a little bit, such a tiny \nbit, upwards. And as he twists and crawls and wrenches himself up through the \nhole, in spite of the excruciating slowness, disregarding the scrapes and cuts it \nopens in his soft and wormly skin, Sam allows himself to dream of what might \nbe at the top. He has long since discarded any hope of joy, but deep down he \nstill believes there may be a place where he does not suffer as now. \nAnd after hours, days, impossible to measure weeks, maybe he has moved a \nmeter. Even more perhaps, and however bruised and broken his body may \nnow be, he is closer to the sky, and nobody can take that away from him. Until \nthe rains begin to fall. \n[Things start to sound wetter] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nThe rains fall here as they do so many places in this new world. Thick and oily \ndrops that taste of bitter salt, torrential tears plummeting from the watching \nsky, thumping and squelching onto the thirsty soil in which the worms writhe \npainfully towards a surface that does not want them. The ground softens. \nShifts. And starts to slip and flow into a torrent of black mud. \n[Ethereal singing fades in; the same music that once came from the \nCoffin artifact] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nDeep below, Sam feels rain begin to drip upon his forehead, and he knows \nexactly what it means. He wants to scream again but he is so tired by his \nascent that the only sound he can produce is a low, defeated wail. And as has \nhappened so many times before in his poor, defeated life, he feels the walls \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 166 – The Worms \n14 \nbegin to shift and soften, as the slippery flood pushes him down, down, down. \nDeeper, perhaps, than he has ever been before, so deep the light is almost \ngone, but never is the darkness fully complete. There must always be a distant \npromise of escape. \n[Wetness fades out, singing becomes part of the background] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nSometimes, when his despair is at its peak, and the sky seems only there to \nmock him, Sam changes his direction. He has breathed the mud so long he has \nno thought of suffocation, and he pushes his face into the walls of his tunnel \nand starts to try and dig across. He is afraid of what he might find beyond the \nlimits of his own constricted tunnel, but between the fear and the despair he \nmakes his choice and digs. \nFor days or weeks he squirms and struggles through the hard-packed soil, mind \ndwelling on a pinprick spot of light that he might never see again. What has he \ndone? Abandoning the route that has been carved for his emergence. The \npanic begins to set in, and he shudders and weeps slick, muddy tears of his \nown. \nBut then one day, Sam pushes forward and feels his face break through a wall. \nThe earth parts and he finds himself in a tiny sliver of open air. A room. A \ncavern. A way out. It is only as he slides inside so neatly that he realizes what it \nis. Another tunnel. For another worm. And as he falls deeper into it, he finds \nhimself staring at the pale and hairless face of its inhabitant. \nPoor Sam has no way to know his neighbour’s name is Richard, that he once \nstruggled in a life as hard and desperate as his own. That his dreams of the \nlight and painful screaming climb towards it is just as keen and gruelling. All", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 3, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 4057}}
