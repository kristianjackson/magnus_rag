When I mentioned I was looking into impetuous hunting \ntrips, he asked how averse I was to hiking. I said not at all, I’ve a been a very \nactive sort, and he told me that in Virginia, his home state, there were a lot of \nexcellent places to go hunting, providing I didn’t mind waiting until October or \nNovember. I wasn’t exactly expecting the Grim Reaper to come knocking in the \nintervening months, so I told him it sounded lovely. \nWe spent a good long while discussing it, and finally decided to take a three \nday hike into Blue Ridge on the Appalachian Trail, and see if we could find a \ndeer or an elk for me to shoot. Nature, seclusion and guns – to my ears it \nsounded just perfect. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG031 – First Hunt \n3 \n \nSo, early last month I packed my bags and caught a plane over to Virginia. The \nweather was cold but otherwise pleasant, and to be honest I was surprised \nhow similar it felt to Torquay in November. I normally live in Torquay. I think I \nput that on your form there. If I did, it won’t hurt you to have it written down \ntwice. I wasn’t, however, fully prepared to meet Arden in person. I’d never met \nan Internet friend in real life before, and he was far louder and more outgoing \nthan I was prepared for, based on the well thought-out and considerate \ncommunications we had previously exchanged. He kept laughing at everything \nI said as though it was a joke, even when it wasn’t a joke, and would not stop \ngoing on about my accent. \nStill, all was forgiven when he showed me his gun cabinet. They were beautiful, \nand while I’m a member of a few shooting clubs over here, you’ve always got \nto keep your rifles under lock and key, hidden away out of sight. To see a \ndozen, well-cared for weapons displayed proudly, well, it was just lovely. \nWe set out the following day, driving up to Blue Ridge from his home in \nRichmond. It took some time to get there, as everything is so much further \napart in America, but we parked at Crabtree Falls shortly after midday. We had \nour tents and our supplies. I was very excited to don my hunters orange, and to \ntake up my rifle. I was carrying a Winchester M70, which I had read was very \ngood for beginners, while Arden carried a Remington Model 673, his preferred \nfirearm, which he talked about to me at great length. And off we went up the \ntrail. \nOur first day was unsuccessful. I was something of a blundering presence, and \nthough Arden was at pains to assure me that our failure was simply due to \nbeing too close to a road, I was sure that it was my own crashing footsteps \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG031 – First Hunt \n4 \n \nscaring away the creatures. I mean, we hadn’t gone far compared to our \nproposed route, but we were already several miles from the nearest road. \nAs the day wore on, we began to look for somewhere to set up camp. We were \nattempting to “Leave No Trace”, as the Americans say, so we were likely going \nto set our tents up on the trail itself, but as we began to get them out I heard \nthe strangest thing. It sounded like somebody whistling, a slow version of The \nFarmer in the Dell or, as I believe it’s more commonly known, A-Hunting We \nShall Go. \nI looked over, and by the expression of puzzlement on Arden’s face it was clear \nhe heard it as well. I was just about to call out to whoever was whistling, when \na figure wandered very casually through the treeline and onto the trail. He \nwalked out of thick woodland as though he were strolling down a promenade. \nHe was short and lean, with long, shaggy black hair and a slightly unkempt \ngoatee. His clothes were the rugged, durable sort you’d expect to see on a \nhiker, but he had no jacket or coat. He carried no backpack or kit of any sort. In \nfact it seemed like he was just wandering through the woods with the clothes \non his back. \nArden was quicker to pick up on this than I was and asked the man if he \nneeded any help. The hiker stared at him for several long seconds, as though \ntrying to deduce something, then smiled and said, “No”. I didn’t like that smile \none bit. Far too many teeth to it, I’d say. He asked us where we were heading, \nhow long we were on the trail for. There was something ever so slightly odd \nabout his intonation, and he dragged the Rs somehow when he spoke. We \nanswered as vaguely as we could without being rude, since neither of us felt \ncomfortable near this man.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 1, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 4388}}
