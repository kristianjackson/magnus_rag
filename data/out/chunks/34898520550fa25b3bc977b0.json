As far as I’m aware they were sent away to live their lives with very \ndistant relatives, never to return. I’m sure it’s possible my mother resolved the \nmatter in a less pleasant manner, but in my limited interaction with her she \nnever struck me as a cruel woman, and I would imagine for children that age \nthe fear and isolation of being uprooted and sent away is just as strong as that \nof meeting a more… grisly fate. \nI, of course, was the favoured son, being quiet and reserved and, at all points, \ndeeply engaged with my own loneliness. I had no time for books or television \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 159 – The Last \n \n11 \nor any of the escapes and artificial friendships of fiction. No; I was myself and \nthat was enough. I would spend my days exploring the wide grounds and \nforests of our estate, finding the hidden corners I thought that none would \nhave found before me, (amused) though now I wonder how many generations \nof Lukas’ had exactly those thoughts in exactly those spots. \nAs soon as I was old enough, I would run away for days at a time. I would take \nwhat money I needed from my mother’s purse and hitchhike to any city I could \nreach. Looking back I realise how odd it was that her purse was always so full \nof cash, and I believe it may have been the closest thing I ever received to her \nblessing. By the time I arrived at whatever destination I had arbitrarily picked it \nwould usually be night. I would walk around the darkened streets, drinking in \nthe sodium orange, looking at the lit windows of the tower blocks that \nsurrounded me, each one a small cosy den of warmth and humanity, and \nrevelling in my distance from them. Sometimes I would pass another late night \ntraveller on the street and I would hate them. They shattered the distance, my \ncocoon of quiet stillness, and I wished with all my heart that they would simply \ndisappear. And one day, one of them did. \nI still remember him well. He was tall and broad, wearing a green raincoat he \nclearly bought before middle age began to set in. There was a thin drizzle that \nnight, one of those rains you can’t see, but leaves everything glistening and \ndamp, and he was struggling with an umbrella. I tried to pass him quickly, but \nhis eyes met mine and he... smiled. And asked if I could help him. I can’t \ndescribe the feeling that passed through me, I can only say that I told him to go \naway. And he did. Or perhaps I did? In retrospect it’s hard to be sure which of \nus fell out of the populated world, but either way the sense of blissful relief \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 159 – The Last \n \n12 \nedged with a strange creeping fear was something I’d never experienced \nbefore. It, was, intoxicating. \nWhen I returned I was met by my mother and a small group of stern-faced \nrelatives that I had never seen before, except at funerals. They took me below \nthe house and showed me the truth of our family. It was… difficult to accept at \nfirst, not because I didn’t want it to be true, but because it seemed \nunbelievable that any god could be so perfectly in tune with my heart. I left the \nhouse again shortly after, and took to the sea. I never saw my mother again. \nExcept, of course, at funerals. \nSome of my most peaceful memories were on the Tundra. I had gathered a \nsmall group of trusted souls who I knew were loyal and dedicated to my \nmoney. They had no qualms or morals about what we did on that boat, and at \nmy request each signed to the ship under a false name so I would never have \nto know who they were. Those lonely nights of sacrifice and waiting, hearing \nthe dreadful sound of my ancestor’s whistle drift over the dark and brooding \nwaters, knowing another soul was leaving this world. God, I wish I was there \nnow, locked in my cabin, staring over the quiet emptiness of the open ocean. \nBut it’s moored now, and I came on land at Elias’ request. My crew is out there \nwaiting for a call I think I am now unlikely ever to give them. \nI will call him Elias, for that’s how I’ve known him for most of our acquaintance, \nthough I originally met him when he was still James Wright, head of The \nMagnus Institute. I considered him a dull little man at first, so keen to watch \nother people’s misery, to lose himself in second-hand pain and drama, exactly \nthe sort of thing I’d always been so keen to avoid.
