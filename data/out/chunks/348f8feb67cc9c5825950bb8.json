And then the world was nothing but silent blue. I had expected \nthe water to be warmer, given the temperature on the surface, but the chill hit \nme all at once and it took a moment to get to grips with it. I saw Julio next to \nme, a few yards away, and with a thumbs up, we began to dive down towards \nthe sunken boat. \nMost people don't appreciate how quickly it gets dark underwater.

If you're not careful, it's easy to forget which way is \nup and become lost in the murky depths, but Julio and I were a well-practiced \nteam and we weren't going so far down as to face any darkness that our \ntorches couldn't handle. \nIt was during that descent, when I saw that our two points of light were the \nonly signs of movement down there, that I noticed the absence of life.
