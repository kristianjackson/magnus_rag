There’s a certain shape it tends to be, and the folk \ncarrying it had to take a second to manage the shifting weight of it. Might have \nlooked like a big old flight case, but as I soon as I saw it, I were certain there \nwas somebody inside. What I didn’t know was, alive or dead? \n \nJULIA \nLooking back, I feel like an idiot. I was watching them unload that same case. It \nwas policy to have whoever was working security present for deliveries, \nsomething about insurance. Thinking about it, I even noticed Trevor lurking \npast the fence, though I didn’t give much thought to just another tramp. \n \n(Trevor chuckles) \n \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG109 – Nightfall \n \n13 \n \nI had no idea what they had in the box, though. They told me it was new \ncomputer servers, and I didn’t have any reason not to believe them. They’d \nhad plenty of similar deliveries before. Vardan was there and we talked for a \nwhile. He wanted to discuss the tennis, I think, but I’ve never really followed \nsport. He didn’t seem suspicious or weird, and I had no reason to think that \nthis was anything other than a late delivery of normal computer parts. \n \nThey took the case up to their offices, and I returned to my desk with a fresh \ncup of coffee and a plan to dig in for the night with some episodes of an old \nradio show I was working my way through. The plan went pretty smoothly for \nan hour or two, with the exception of a couple of DKN employees silently \nshuffling past at unnerving moments. Then I happened to glance up at one of \nthe video feeds and saw that the tramp I saw earlier had managed to sneak \ninside the building. \n \nTREVOR \nIt wasn’t as hard as all that. Didn’t even need to break a window or nothing, \njust waited until the last of the office weirdos were heading back inside. They \nwere slow enough; it were pretty simple to tail them through before the door \nswung shut. Once in, I had a look around for cameras, because I knew there \nwere a security guard. I’d seen her when they were unloading and I were \npretty sure I could take her out if I needed to. \n \nJULIA \n(Chuckling) In your dreams, old man. \n \nTREVOR \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG109 – Nightfall \n \n14 \n \nBut I didn’t want it to come to that. I tried to stay out of sight, but she must \nhave spotted me, because soon enough I could hear her coming my way. I \nmanaged to duck into a stairwell and head up towards the fourth floor, where \nthe front of the building said Darvish’s company was. I could hear her behind \nme though, so I ducked out a floor early and nipped inside a cleaning cupboard \nto wait her out. \n \nJULIA \nI went all the way to the fourth floor, not realising that this git wasn’t up there. \nThe corridor light was out, and I made a note to replace it later as I turned on \nmy torch. It was very quiet, far quieter than I would have expected for a \ncompany installing new equipment. I took a moment to get my bearings and \nthere was no sound at all. Utter silence, except for the faintest drip, drip, drip, \ncoming from somewhere up ahead. I called out, first for the trespasser, then \nfor Vardan, then for anybody who might be up there, but there was no answer. \n \nMy torch beam fell on the door labelled DKN systems. It stood open, \nunmoving, with no light at all coming from inside. As my light crossed the \ndoorframe, I could see the windows had been covered with thick wooden \nboards, and painted a dark matte black. In the corner of my mind, I could feel \npanic starting to claw its way up, as the darkness started to press in on me. I \ncalled out again, but there was still no reply. I wanted to turn around and run \nback to the light, but not enough, not as much as I wanted to overcome my \nfear. \n \nI slowly headed inside, calling out every few steps to make sure anyone who \nmight be in there knew I was with security. Inside, the rooms were bare,", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 4, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 3920}}
