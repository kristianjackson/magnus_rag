Although according to Georgie, John doesn’t. Like, \nat all. \n \nBASIRA \nOh. Yeah, that does explain some stuff. Wait, hang on, do I know Georgie? \n \nMELANIE \nI don’t think so. Georgie Barker? She does What the Ghost? \n \nBASIRA \nNo way, I used to love that show! I mean, the first couple of seasons, at least. \nTook a weird turn in Season 3, when they introduced— \n \nMELANIE \nWell, she and John, they dated. \n \nBASIRA \nYeah? \n \nMELANIE \nI mean, it was years ago, but— \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG106 ‘A Matter of Perspective’ \n \n13 \n \n \nBASIRA \nHuh. I always used to put on podcasts when I was driving around. You know, \nwhen I wasn’t on duty, and when Daisy didn’t need the radio. \n \nMELANIE \nI literally cannot picture Daisy listening to the radio. \n \nBASIRA \nThe Archers. \n \nMELANIE \nNo. \n \nBASIRA \nHand to God. \n \nMELANIE \nI, I actually do not believe you. \n \nBASIRA \nShe never missed an episode. \n \n(Melanie exhales in astonishment) \n \nOh, sorry, did you need to finish up? \n \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG106 ‘A Matter of Perspective’ \n \n14 \n \nMELANIE \nNo, I, I actually have no idea what I was going to say. I did have more notes on, \num, on... space, I guess? But uh, forget it, let’s go. \n \nBASIRA \nI should probably go check in with Martin, you know, see if he’s in for drinks. \n \nMELANIE \nSo you can double-check your gossip? \n \nBASIRA \nI don’t gossip. I have the mind of an investigator. \n \nMELANIE \nRight, okay. Anyway, I’ll go find him. \n \n(Melanie gets up) \n \nI could really do with the walk. Do you want to go ahead, grab the booth? \n \nBASIRA \nYeah, sure, I can wait. I’ve got a book. \n \nMELANIE \nOf course you do. \n \n(Click) \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG106 ‘A Matter of Perspective’ \n \n15 \n \n \n(Click) \n \n(Papers are shuffled, followed by a door knock) \n \nELIAS \nCome in, Melanie. \n \n(Door opens) \n \nMELANIE \n(Guardedly) Martin said you wanted to see me? \n \nELIAS \nYes, please come in. I thought it was about time for your first performance \nreview. \n \nMELANIE \n(Laughing) I, um, I didn’t even know that was, uh... Well, there wasn’t anything \nscheduled. \n \nELIAS \nNo, well, given the recent, um, tensions in the office, I thought it probably best \nif you weren’t aware of it in advance. \n \nMELANIE \nRight... \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG106 ‘A Matter of Perspective’ \n \n16 \n \n \nELIAS \nLess time to prepare, you understand. \n \nMELANIE \nRight. \n \nELIAS \nSo, have a seat. \n \nYou’ve been with us a few months now, I believe. \n \nMELANIE \nYeah. \n \nELIAS \nAnd how are you finding it? \n \nMELANIE \nIs that a joke? \n \nELIAS \nAside from the obvious, I mean. \n \nMELANIE \nOh, well, I suppose it’s been... unstructured. Without John around and with \nyou being sat up here lurking, there’s not been a lot of useful direction. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG106 ‘A Matter of Perspective’ \n \n17 \n \n \nELIAS \n(Making notes) I see. \n \nMELANIE \nI mean, you pick out a statement occasionally, and John might phone in to ask \nafter some scrap of information, but to be honest, no-one’s even really told me \nwhat an “archival assistant” is actually supposed to do. \n \nELIAS \nSo how have you been occupying your time? \n \nMELANIE \nReading, mostly. Doing some of my own research. \n \nELIAS \nInto what? \n \nMELANIE \n(Defensive) My own projects. \n \nELIAS \nOf course. And ‘plotting my demise’? \n \nMELANIE \nWhen I get a chance, yes. \n \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG106 ‘A Matter of Perspective’ \n \n18 \n \nELIAS \nHm. \n \nMELANIE \nI suppose that doesn’t look very good on my review? \n \nELIAS \nQuite frankly, no. \n \nMELANIE \nWell, if you need to fire me, I won’t make a scene. \n \nELIAS \nNo, no, I’m afraid not. \n \nMELANIE \nSure. \n \nELIAS \n(Sighing) I wish I knew the words that would make you believe me. \n \nMELANIE \nWhat? That you’re a literal dead man’s switch. \n \nELIAS \nNo. If that was the only issue, I could have simply placed the knowledge in your \nmind.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 5, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 4059}}
