Maybe we’re all just broken inside, unable to really grasp the \ndifference between fictional people and people we just don’t know. They’re all \njust abstract ideas we’re happy to have suffer for our enjoyment. Or maybe the \nfact it really happened is exactly the point, adding the awful spice of reality to \npeople’s morbid fantasies. When I think of the lurid joy some people would \nfeel if I were caught, the serial killer’s daughter taking over the family business, \nit makes me sick. \n \nBut even back then, with my hands unbloodied, that collective obsession with \nbrutality chased me through my life. In the summer of 2010, I made another \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG109 – Nightfall \n \n9 \n \nattempt to outrun my father’s legacy and moved up to Manchester to take a \nnew job. It was night shift work, security and maintenance for an old office \nbuilding occupied by a handful of failing companies trying to save money on \nfloorspace. I liked it because I didn’t really have to talk to anyone. I was on the \ndesk alone, and generally anyone working there late enough to cross paths \nwith me wasn’t in a talking mood. \n \nThere was another reason that I chose to work nights. If you’ve read my \nstatement, then I’m sure it will come as no surprise that for most of my life I’ve \nhad quite a significant fear of the dark. I used to lie awake at night, listening, \nstraining my ears for the noise of movement or that dreadful growl coming out \nof the dark. It was one of my better counsellors that suggested I try working \nnights as a way to address it. And it worked, for the most part. It made the \ndarkness mundane, just another aspect of my everyday life to be dealt with, \nand kept me within the comforting glow of lamps and light bulbs basically all \nthe time. It also let me sleep during the day, when the faintest hint of sunlight \nthat crept around edges of my thick bedroom curtains made me feel safe \nenough to relax. It made dating even harder, of course, but by that point I’d \nmostly given up trying. It wasn’t a perfect solution, by any means, but it \nhelped. To start with, at least. \n \nI never really worried about keeping track of the companies that kept offices in \nmy building. It seemed like they came and went pretty regularly. Sometimes a \nstart-up would make it big, but usually it was the inevitable bankruptcy that \nmoved them out. All except DKN Systems. I never really figured out what it was \nthey were meant to be doing, something full of meaningless buzzwords like \n“business networks” or “media solutions”. Thinking about it, it might actually \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG109 – Nightfall \n \n10 \n \nhave been “business media network solutions”. Point is, there didn’t seem to \nbe anything suspicious about them. At least not at first. I knew a bit more \nabout them than the other people renting space, since they seemed to do a lot \nof work after dark, and there were a handful of their staff I knew on sight. I \nmean, I assumed they also did a lot of work in the daytime that I just wasn’t \nseeing, so it didn’t seem particularly weird, just another small business burning \nthe candle everywhere they could to stay afloat. \n \nBut even if the company itself didn’t seem weird, the people who worked for it \nreally did. I remember there were four of them normally around, and at one \npoint I thought it must have been a family thing, because I got it in my head \nthat they were related. I don’t know why, they didn’t even look that similar, \nbut there was just something about their faces. It was the eyes, I think. It \nlooked like they all had irises so dark that they seemed almost completely \nblack. And they dressed the same, not like a uniform, but they all wore black \ntrousers, a dark blue shirt and a brown leather belt. They also wore soft-soled \nblack canvas shoes, which were almost completely silent when walking down \nthe carpeted halls of the building. It made them even more unsettling, quietly \nwandering the corridors, never quite looking where they were going. Like their \nattention was focused on something you just couldn’t see. \n \nThere was only one of them that ever spoke, at least to me: a young man by \nthe name of Vardan Darvish. He seemed to be the manager, at least as much \nas there was any clear structure, and unlike his colleagues he seemed happy, \nalmost eager to talk. I asked him about it once, and he laughingly told me that \nhis co-workers “didn’t sign up for the quality of conver", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 2, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 4500}}
