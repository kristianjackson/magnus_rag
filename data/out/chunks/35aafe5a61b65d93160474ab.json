Of \nwhat, I couldn’t tell you, but those small eyes filled me with a dread that I have \ntrouble describing to you now. Certainly I backed away from the bookshelves, \nand was all set to depart, when my lantern caught on something in the corner \nof the room. Or more precisely, two things: the first was a small gold coin that \nglinted on the floor. The second was a book, perhaps fallen from the shelves \nlong ago. It was in far better condition than the others, perhaps due to where \nit had lain, and I was able to very carefully open it. I was disappointed to see \nthat was not written in German, or even French or Latin, but appeared to be in \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG023 – Schwartzwald \n11 \n \nArabic. It seemed to be an illuminated manuscript of sorts, produced by hand \nand utterly beautiful, though I could not for the life of me have told you what it \nconcerned. \nI took the book and the coin to study later, and hastily left the vault, the \nlingering fear making me feel as though some unseen pursuer might come \nupon me if I hesitated. I drew my pistol as I left the mausoleum, just in case the \nstrange short man from earlier were waiting to accost me, but there was no \nsign of anyone outside in that clear daylight. \nI hurried back, though I still had many hours before dusk. As I went I noticed \nthat the snow on the trees was beginning to thaw, and took comfort in the \nknowledge that Clara and myself would likely be able to return to Closen soon. \nWilhelm was fully recovered from his fever, and by the time I was at dinner, all \ntraces of my earlier fear had disappeared and I was in excellent spirits. \nI retired afterwards to smoke a pipe or two and examine my finds at greater \nlength. The book, though beautiful, stubbornly refused to offer up any clues to \nits contents. With your permission, I’ll bring it over for your expert eyes next \ntime I have the pleasure of your company. The coin, on the other hand, was \nmore interesting. On one side, it had an engraved profile of a sharp-faced \nyoung man with long, flowing hair. Over the top ran the letters JW, and at the \nbottom was the number 1279. If this was the date the coin was produced, then \nI don’t need to tell you how exciting a find this might be. The other side was \nblank, save for three words, very small and worn, but I could just about read \nthem. They read “Für die Stille”. \nI was about to retire to bed, when one of the serving girls, Hilda – or was it \nHelga, I forget – asked me for a moment of my time. I obliged and she said had \nI been asking about the old graveyard out in the forest? I told yes I had, and \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG023 – Schwartzwald \n12 \n \nshe paled ever so slightly. She told me that she never went near the place, that \nno-one in the town did. \nYou see Jonah, apparently there was an old man in Schramberg by the name of \nTobias Kohler. He had lived nearly eighty years, and told tales of when he was \na child and he his friends would play a game they called “Johann’s Steps”. It \nwas a game of bravery, where you had to creep down as many steps as you \ncould into the tomb of Johann von Württemberg until you were seen, and then \nrun back out as fast as you could. Tobias would never say who or what you \nwere seen by, and always ignored the question. Well, apparently, the parents \nof these children found out about this game and one of them, the mother of \nTobias’ friend Hans Winkler, decided to put an end it. She stormed into the \ncemetery and, seeing Hans entering the mausoleum for his turn, she ran inside \nafter him and down the steps. None of the children saw what happened, but \nthey all heard the scream. They fled back to town, and when they told of what \nhad happened, the town priest, whose name Tobias does not remember, \nsimply nodded and, gathering up six strong, though deeply fearful, men, they \nheaded out toward the cemetery. None of that party ever spoke of what they \nsaw or found there, but Hans went to live with the Becker family out on their \nsmall farm. No-one played “Johann’s Steps” again, and the cemetery was once \nagain left deserted. \nThe only other thing Tobias remembered was that he had once heard a great \nuncle refer to Johann von Württemberg as “Ulrich’s bastard”, which, if the date \non the coin was correct, may be referring to Ulrich I or Ulrich II, but either way \nthat place’s history must stretch back almost six hundred years. \nBut now, I feel I have talked around it long eno", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 6, "chunk_count": 10, "chars": 4500}}
