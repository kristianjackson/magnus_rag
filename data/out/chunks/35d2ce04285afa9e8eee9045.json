It was bright, so bright. Candles covered every \nsurface, each glowing so powerfully that I could barely look directly at them. \nThe layout was how I remembered, but the pews were all empty, and I could \nsee none of the statues or crosses that I expected. The man led me unresisting \ninto the vestry, where I found my cassock and stole laid out in front of me. The \nstole was not green as I would have expected for a normal Sunday mass, nor \nwas it violet or red or any other liturgical colour. Instead it was a pale, sickly \nyellow. I felt the eyes of the altar server upon my back, and dressed quickly. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG020 – Desecrated Host \n6 \n \nAt that moment the bell rang to mark the start of the mass. It was a single, \njarring tone that cut through the air and made me almost double over in pain, \nso badly did it pierce into my pounding skull. I regained myself, gripping the \nthin, bony arm of the altar server, and walked out into the church. The pews \nwere full now. Row upon row of people, far more than had ever before \nattended a mass that I had said. Each was dressed in black from head to toe, \nand their skin was fevered, jaundiced yellow. The eyes of every man, woman \nand child stared blankly forward, and their mouths hung open, wide and \nsmiling, like their jaws had locked in silent rictus. \nI could have left. I know that now. I know that my will and my actions were my \nown, and even at the time I knew that what I was seeing was so wrong. So very \nwrong but... it didn’t feel like at the time I could have made any other choice. \nEven in that strange place, stared at by hellish parishioners I must have known \nweren’t really there. G–… Forgive me, even then, I thought to find some \ncomfort in the liturgy. The odd smelling incense swirled about me from the \naltar server’s brazier and my head swam with a scent that felt so familiar, yet \nso foreign. \nFinally, I stood before the altar and began the mass. I was surprised as I spoke, \nand the holy names slipped from my mouth without hesitation, but the \ncongregation I addressed were quiet, and each pause for a response was met \nwith only that oppressive, wide-mouthed silence, a jarring void that tightened \nthe fear I felt gripping my soul. When the Liturgy of the Word began, I watched \nin silent dread as the altar server stepped to the pulpit to deliver the first \nreading. He stood there, dark eyes scanning the open bible, before he raised \nhis head and looked up as though to speak, but all that came from his throat \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG020 – Desecrated Host \n7 \n \nwas the single tolling sound of that bell, and my head pulsed in pain. The same \nthing happened for the second reading, that long, drawn out chime. \nThen came the reading of the Gospel. I walked to the pulpit myself, and saw \nthe passage indicated was Mark, chapter 9, verses 14-19. I began to try and \nread it, but my voice was gone and from my own mouth came the sound of \nthat bell. I fell to the floor, but no-one moved to help me. \nEventually I was able to stand again, and a dull panic began to rise within me as \nI realised that next came the liturgy of the eucharist. The thought of these \npeople, these things, taking the body of J– taking the sacrament of holy \ncommunion felt like the direst of blasphemies. I didn’t stop, though. I didn’t \nknow what else to do, and my mind was swimming with the sound of the bell \nand the collective horror of all the things that I had seen and felt. \nThe altar server brought me the communion wafers and the wine, and I took \nthem. My hands felt strange and clammy as I held them, but I brought them to \nthe altar and began to speak. This time my words came out crisp and clear, and \nas I said them I noticed fewer and fewer of the parishioners seemed to be in \nthe pews. Hope began to rise within me as it seemed the words would work to \nbanish these jaundiced watchers and I pressed on. Finally, the pews were \nempty, and my heart soared as I turned towards the tabernacle to retrieve the \nrest of the host. \nIt was strange, the rich cloth curtain that covered that ornate metal box \nseemed stuck, so I pulled and pulled and eventually it came free. I opened the \ndoor and retrieved the Host, returning it to the altar. Then I... I lifted it to my \nmouth, and I ate. It did not taste as I expected.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 3, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 4413}}
