Melanie? I thought— This— \nMARTIN \n(Whispering) Sorry. Sorry, John. I’m-I’m not sure how much everything up \nthere actually understood what was going on. But, y’know, I didn’t want to \ntake any chances so it made sense to... um… \nARCHIVIST \nPut on a show? \nMARTIN \nAh, yeah, basically, more or less. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 189 – Peers \n \n20 \nGEORGIE \nMartin says it’s much harder for you to avoid attention up there. \nMELANIE \nAnother reason we should have left them up there. Still. Glad you’re alive and \nthat. \nARCHIVIST \nLikewise, I... oh… Ooo… \nMELANIE \nOh, I know that sound. He’s going pale, right? Five quid says he’s about to \ncollapse again. \nARCHIVIST \n(Archly) I am not going to collapse. What do you mean again? \nMELANIE \nOh come on. You do it all the time. \nARCHIVIST \n(Brokenly) I do not— I… I’m just feeling a little bit woozy alright? I-I can’t quite \nthink straight. Like at, um... um, Martin, you remember? \nGEORGIE \nIs this what you were talking about? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 189 – Peers \n \n21 \nMARTIN \nAh-yeah, if something messes with his connection, he can get a little... vague. \nARCHIVIST \nI don’t like being discussed like I’m not here. \nMELANIE \nThen you are going to love the others. \nMARTIN \nWhat others? \nGEORGIE \nThere’s a small group of… survivors we managed to pull out of some of the \nnearby hells. They, um... They think we’re... ‘special’. You know, because The \nEye can’t see us. \nMELANIE \nIt’s fine, Georgie. You can use the c word. \nMARTIN \nE-Excuse me? \nGEORGIE \nFine. We’ve got, sort of a... cult. \nMARTIN \nWh— Ooooh... kay… \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 189 – Peers \n \n22 \nARCHIVIST \nThat’s... not what I was expecting. \nMELANIE \nMm-hmm. It’s extremely weird. \nGEORGIE \nIt wasn’t intentional. It just sort of happened. Although… I have to admit it can \nbe useful, occasionally. \nARCHIVIST \nOkay, this is, uh… this is a-a lot. Why don’t we take it from the top? \nGEORGIE \nAlright. \nARCHIVIST \nYou’re alive! \nGEORGIE \nYeah. \nARCHIVIST \nGood. \nMELANIE \nI keep telling her that technically there’s no proof of that. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 189 – Peers \n \n23 \nARCHIVIST \nI’m really glad. \nMARTIN \nFriendly faces have been kind of rare. Or weird. \nARCHIVIST \nH-How are you here? What, what happened? \nGEORGIE \nWhen the world started to change, it just didn’t hit me and Melanie. Not, not \nreally. \nMELANIE \nGeorgie’s got that fearless thing going on, and me and The Eye, well, you \nremember our messy divorce. \nARCHIVIST \nSure. \nGEORGIE \nWe figured you’d know what was going on, so we headed for the Institute, but \nit was, um, well, you saw it up there. We couldn’t find you, and by the time we \narrived the world was full nightmare. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 189 – Peers \n \n24 \nMELANIE \nThere was nowhere to go back to, so I told her about the tunnels. Turns out, \nnot only were they still here, they actually do a decent job of hiding things. \nWhen you aren’t painting a huge target on our backs. \nGEORGIE \nMelanie... \nMELANIE \n(Sharply) What? I’m here, aren’t I? I didn’t say anything about being nice about \nit. \nGEORGIE \nNo you didn’t. \nMELANIE \nSo… let me moan. \nARCHIVIST \n…I’m sorry to cause a fuss. \nMELANIE \n(Snorts) Bit late for that. \nMARTIN \nHow did you know we were there? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 189 – Peers \n \n25 \nGEORGIE \nHow could we not? The entire city knows you were there. \nMARTIN \n(Under his breath) Oh, yeah. \nMELANIE \n(Sarcastically) Everyone is so excited to see the Ceaseless Watcher’s special \nlittle boy. \n(Martin and Georgie giggle) \nARCHIVIST \nYes, well. \nGEORGIE \nAlways did enjoy being the centre of things. \n(Martin and Melanie giggle) \nARCHIVIST \nSo, what’s next? \nMARTIN \nWell, I vote we catch up somewhere that’s maybe not quite so close to the \nsinister mega-tower. \n[Martin starts to move]", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 5, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 4183}}
