It seems to have a particular fondness for them. \nARCHIVIST \nWhat about bones? Does one of them manifest with, with bones? \nLEITNER \n(Sigh) You’re thinking too literally. Examining the physical categorisation, but \nignoring the meaning of the thing. What are the bones? In the Distortion, your \n“Michael”, the structure of a skeleton, an established reality in your mind, is \ntwisted and warped into an impossible form. But in other cases? Are they a \nsymbol of slaughter and butchery? Are they the familiar made wrong? Or are \nthey simply part of the messy, physicality of flesh? \nARCHIVIST \nI’m sorry, this is a lot to take in. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG080 – The Librarian \nLEITNER \nWell, do so quickly. We’ve wasted enough time on your questions. \nARCHIVIST \nFine. Then I’ll make this one simple: did you kill Gertrude? \nLEITNER \nNo. Don’t be absurd. \nARCHIVIST \nThen who did? \nLEITNER \nThis is a distraction! You’re in no danger – \nARCHIVIST \nWho? \nLEITNER \nI believe it was Elias. \nARCHIVIST \nWhat? Why? \nLEITNER \nI assume he discovered we were planning to destroy the Archives. \nARCHIVIST \nGertrude was going to destroy the Archives? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG080 – The Librarian \nLEITNER \nThis is why I need those files. I searched this place thoroughly, and they’re not \nhere, so I assume Elias took them when he killed her. I need your help to get \ninto his office. \nARCHIVIST \nBut the cameras? They showed him. \nLEITNER \nSimple mechanical eyes? In his place of power? You think he can’t control \neverything they see? Assuming such interference wouldn’t ruin them beyond \nrecovery, of course. \nARCHIVIST \nThis place belongs to one of them, doesn’t it? \nLEITNER \nYou know the answer to that. \nARCHIVIST \nThe Eye. \nLEITNER \nI have also heard it called Beholding. \nARCHIVIST \nAnd I… \nLEITNER \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG080 – The Librarian \nYou belong to it, too. \nARCHIVIST \nI… Uh… I… I think I need some air. \nLEITNER \nWe don’t have time for you to have a breakdown, Archivist. \n[A chair is pushed back.] \nARCHIVIST \nI’m going to have a cigarette. Don’t… \n[The office door opens.] \nDon’t. \n[The office door closes. There’s silence.] \nLEITNER \nI’m not sure you would have liked him, you know. He’s paranoid enough. But I \ndon’t think he’s got the stomach for it. \n[There’s silence. The office door opens. Leitner gasps.] \nELIAS \nWell. This is a surprise. \n[Leitner stands up, the chair scraping against the floor.] \nELIAS \nReach for a book and I will kill you. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG080 – The Librarian \n[Leitner sits again.] \nELIAS \nHow much have you told him? \nLEITNER \nEnough. \nELIAS \nAbout Gertrude? \nLEITNER \nNo. No, I didn’t have time. \nELIAS \nI’ve wondered for so long who it could be down there. Who was helping her. I \nhonestly never would have guessed. \nLEITNER \nHow did you know I was here? \nELIAS \nI didn’t. You’re very well hidden. But John is not, and he failed to take the same \nprecautions I’m sure you took for granted with Gertrude. I knew he was talking \nto someone. And it turns out to be Jurgen Leitner himself. (Laughs) What an \nhonour. \nLEITNER \nElias, please! \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG080 – The Librarian \nELIAS \nWhat did you want from him? \nLEITNER \nThe files. The ones you took from Gertrude. \nELIAS \nPlanning a little light arson, are we, Jurgen? \nLEITNER \nIt’s not just the Institute and you know it. They had everything she had found \non the Stranger. \nELIAS \nI know. It’s, um… what do they call it? \nLEITNER \nThe Unknowing. \nELIAS \n(Laughs) Creativity never was their forte. \nLEITNER \nYou of all people should want to stop them. \nELIAS \nAnd we will. But I don’t think we’ll need your help. \nLEITNER \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG080 – The Librarian \nAnd what’s he going to think when he gets back? \nELIAS \nWell, he was always going to need to fly the nest at some point. Go out and \nsee the world for himself. \nLEITNER \nHe might die. \nELIAS \nIt’s always a danger. Almost always. \nLEITNER \nElias, it doesn’t have to be like – \n[Extended sounds of brutal pipe murder] \n[The pipe is dropped on the floor, as Elias leaves the office, closing the door. \nThere’s a silence, except for the ominous sound of dripping. The office door \nopens again.] \nARCHIVIST \nSorry, I’ve been quit for five years now, but th– \n(Silence) Oh. \nOh god… I need to… Uh… I need to, um… \n[Tape clicks off. Tape clicks on.] \nTIM", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 6, "chunk_count": 9, "chars": 4410}}
