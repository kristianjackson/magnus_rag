It is reportedly a hotbed for \nlow key hauntings, but nothing of the magnitude we’ve heard from others. \nScott is concerning, however. While Smirke seems to have built a handful of \nnotable buildings around London, Sir George Gilbert Scott is responsible for \nlandmarks such as St Pancras Station, the Albert Memorial and the restoration \nof Westminster Abbey. If his buildings have similar quirks, then... well, to be \nhonest, I don’t know what that would mean, but I doubt it would be good.

You know, the one who came \nto look into Gertrude. \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nBasira? Where is... when was this? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG050 – Foundations \n11 \n \n \nTIM \nUh, uh, yesterday. You were at physical therapy. \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nDid she say why? \n \nTIM \nNo. It was a bit weird really. I’ve seen her round here a few times before \nactually. I, um... I don’t trust her. \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nSorry, what? \n \nTIM \nWell, I asked her if she had anything new to report on Gertrude and she just \nsaid no and then mumbled a question about when you’d be back. Then she \nleft. It was weird. She’s weird. \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nYou don’t have a problem with the police, do you, Tim? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG050 – Foundations \n12 \n \n \nTIM \nWell, you do know I’m the finest cat burglar in all of Bromley. \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nTim. \n \nTIM \nOkay, so, seriously, I don’t get why she keeps coming back round here outside \nof the investigation. \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nShe’s... I’m... I’m helping her with some of the investigation. Off the record. \n \nTIM \nOh...
