He had friends, as well, plenty of friends, how could he \nnot? And he would take me out to meet them when I wanted to, and when I \ndidn’t he let me be. After a year with him I actually had what could perhaps be \ncalled a social life and, more than that, I didn’t hate it. I always used to roll my \neyes at people who said that their loved ones ‘completed them’, but I honestly \ncan’t think of any other way to describe how it felt to be with Evan. I proposed \nto him after only two years, and he said yes. \nI’ll skip over the bit where he dies. It’s only been a year, and I don’t want to \nspend an hour crying into your crappy tape player. Congenital, they said. Some \nproblem with his heart. Always been there, but never diagnosed. No warning. \nOne in a million chance. Blah. Blah. Blah. He was gone. Just gone. And I was \nalone again. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG013 – Alone \n7 \n \nThere was no-one I could talk to about it. All my friends had been his friends, \nand once he was gone it didn’t feel right to see them. I know, I’m sure they \nwouldn’t have minded, they would have said they were my friends too, but I \ncould never bring myself to try. It felt more comfortable, more familiar, to be \nalone as though Evan had just been some wonderful dream I was now waking \nup from. \nI don’t remember the week between his death and the funeral. I’m sure it \nmust have happened, but I don’t have any memory of it at all. After leaving the \nhospital, the next thing that is properly clear in my mind is walking into that \nbig, austere house. I don’t remember where it was, somewhere in Kent, I think, \nand I must have been given the address by someone in Evan’s family who had \norganised the funeral. It was strange. Evan never really talked about his family. \nHe said he wasn’t on good terms with them because they were very religious, \nand he never had been. I’d never met or visited them, or even been told their \nnames, as far as I remember. But they must have known me enough to invite \nme, as I somehow ended up at the right place. Just as well they took on the \nresponsibility for the funeral. I was in no fit state to organise anything. \nThe house was very large, and very old. It had a high gate separating it from \nthe main road, which has the name “Moorland House” carved into the stone of \nthe gatepost. I drove there alone, my old, second-hand Vauxhall Astra \ncomplaining all the way. You remember that storm that hit at the end of last \nMarch? Well, I hardly noticed it. Thinking back, I really shouldn’t have been \ndriving at all, but at the time it barely registered. The trees were bending \nominously when I finally parked at Moorland House, and I immediately lost the \nonly respectful hat that I owned to the wind. Evan had once told me that his \nfamily had a lot of money, and looking at this place I realised why the funeral", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 2, "chunk_count": 9, "chars": 2851}}
