It wasn’t the biggest, maybe an \ninch wide, but its abdomen was swelled grotesquely. I could feel every one of \nits void-black eyes focused upon me, see each hair on its fat, bulbous body, \nand smell the venom I knew dripped from its fangs. I hate spiders, as I have \nsaid, but I would have sworn that this one hated me back. \nNone of this was enough to make me think twice about gingerly pushing Major \nTom towards the thing with my foot and fleeing the room. I made my way into \nthe living room and closed the door behind me, leaving cat and spider to deal \nwith each other. I sat there, watching the TV, some panel show re-run, trying \nnot to think about the thing on my kitchen wall. An hour passed, then two, and \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG016 – Arachnophobia \n5 \n \nfinally I felt like I had enough stability of mind to open the door and confirm \nthat the damned arachnid was gone. \nThe moment I opened the door I felt something furry brush against my leg. \nChoking down a sudden moment of panic, I looked and, sure enough, there \nwas Major Tom, hurrying out of the room at a run. He didn’t seem hurt or \nupset, so I assumed his job was done. Then I turned back to my kitchen, and \nfroze. The spider sat in that same spot. It wasn’t eaten, it hadn’t fled, from \nwhat I could tell it hadn’t even moved! The only way I was sure the thing was \nreal and alive was that I swear to you I could see its mandibles twitching with \nanticipation. I stood there, unable to summon the will to close the kitchen door \nor enter into it fully and cursed Major Tom for a useless bag of fur. \nIt was another hour before I was finally able to move. The whole time I stood \nmotionless in the doorway, watching the fat spider that paraded itself on my \nwall. Still it remained in place, and I couldn’t help but feel that it was daring me \nto do something, to take action, to kill it. I began to move. Slowly, ever so \nslowly, I approached it, reaching a hand over the table and taking the half-\ndrunk mug of coffee, now long cold, in my hand. I gripped the handle so tight I \nwas sure it would snap off in my fingers. Finally, I stood before the spider, \npreparing myself to calmly crush it against the wall. Then it moved without \nwarning and I hurled the mug against the wall with all my might. \nIt hit the spider dead on and exploded in a shower of coffee and china. I stood \nthere for a minute, breathing hard, but all that remained was a large stain on \nthe wall and mug shards littering the floor. I should have cleaned it up \nimmediately, but I was so tired, as though killing the spider had taken every \nounce of wakefulness that I had within me.
