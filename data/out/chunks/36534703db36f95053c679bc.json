None \nof us dressed or uniformed, a few holding salvaged weapons, waiting to know \nwhat was expected of us. The ship began to sail out, down towards the open \nocean, wind and salt cutting through us as we went. My feet felt stuck to the \ndeck, shivering as we watched this weird mismatch of bloody sailors \nmanoeuvre this thing that seemed like it belonged to the bottom the sea. \nLooking around I could see the metal was twisted and bent in places, and the \nstaring closer at the deck below I began to notice rust and holes laced through \nit. There was absolutely no way that this vessel should have been floating. \n \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 137 – Nemesis \n \n7 \n \nAfter an hour we completely lost sight of the land, and the only things beyond \nour ship were the rolling black waters and the hollow glow of a full moon. That \nwas when the music started up again. We were so close now, every pulse of \nthe drum shuddered through us, and the trumpet notes cut through us. I could \nsee now it was made of the same black iron as the ship, and embedded like \nshrapnel in the hand that held it, the lips that blew into it. Whatever spell had \ncome over the others was gone in an instant, and I could feel the sudden terror \nflow out of them in a flood of unleashed fear. Some of them started to \nwhimper, others tried to ask questions of anyone they thought might be \nofficers, but they were ignored, and the music just got louder. \nLeonard was the first to dance. Well, I think of it as a dance, though I don’t \nknow why. He reached over and grabbed another one of the former prisoners, \na scrawny guy, I think his name was Milton. He gave a cry of anger that I could \nnever have imagined coming from his gentle, smiling lips even in the head of \nbattle. There was nothing Milton could do. Even malnourished as he was, it \nwas easy for Leonard to snap his arm like a twig, twist his neck until his leg \nspasmed and his skull started to crack. Even when his victim was clearly dead, \nhe kept beating it, tossing the corpse across the deck with as much ferocity as \nif it were the most hated man alive. The bloody crew of the Nemesis watched, \ntheir eyes riveted and their feet tapping to the music. Leonard’s rampage \nagainst the now unrecognisable corpse of Milton only ended when another \nsoldier, whose name I never knew, leapt forward with that same cry of \nviolence, and began to stab him wildly with a stolen bayonet. \nAs so it continued. Hour upon hour of that night, as one by one the stolen \nprisoners succumbed to that music, their silent, frozen terror giving way in a \nmoment to the eager desire to kill.
