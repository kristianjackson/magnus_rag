It was not until I \nmet Gertrude Robinson that things began to really come into focus. \nYou see, the role of Archivist has been part of the Beholding for as far back as \nmy research can go. This isn’t uncommon for the Powers; most of the beliefs \naround them are guesswork and fallible human interpretation, but there are \ncertain through lines and consistencies that can be spotted, regardless of the \ntrappings. But Gertrude was unlike any other Archivist. She simply did not care \nabout collecting experiences or compiling the fears of others. She was driven \nto stop those who served the Powers. More than once I thought she must \nsecretly be of the Hunt; but there was never that sick joy in her, that thrill of \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 160 – The Eye Opens \n \n13 \npredator and prey. She had simply decided that this was her position in life, \nand went about it with a practicality that even I found disconcerting at times. \nI once asked her what drove her, what had started her down that path. She \ntold me the Desolation had killed her cat. I don’t know if she was joking, and, \nto be honest, I could never bring myself to look into her mind and find out for \nsure. \nIn any case, Gertrude’s ruthless efficiency in derailing and collapsing rituals \nthrew into stark relief a question that had been bothering me for almost a \nhundred and fifty years: In the whole span of humanity, why had nobody ever \nsucceeded? Perhaps there were a long line of Gertrude Robinsons throughout \nhistory, but I found that hard to credit. Could it be, then, that there was \nsomething in the very concept of the rituals that meant they couldn’t succeed? \nShe was clearly having similar thoughts in that last year, all of which \nculminated with the People’s Church. When I saw that she was making no \npreparations whatsoever to stop it, I realized she was putting into practice a \ntheory, and one she couldn’t afford to be wrong. She was going to wait, and \nsee if the unopposed ritual succeeded, or if it collapsed under its own strain as \nmine had all those years ago. Knowing Gertrude, I’m sure she had a backup \nplan if she had miscalculated — but she had not. The ritual failed. And all at \nonce, I realized what needed to be done. \nYou see, the thing about the Fears is that they can never be truly separated \nfrom each other. When does the fear of sudden violence transition into the \npanic of hunted prey? When does the mask of the Stranger become the \ndeception of the Spiral?
