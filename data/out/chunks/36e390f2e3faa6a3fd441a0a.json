Now there was just a cold hunger, a \ndeep anger, as though I had no right to just stand there looking at it. The street \nwas silent, but I could feel it screaming at me to open it. I just about managed \nnot to. I was just about able to walk away. \nI’m sorry, I didn’t mean to get so deep into my own issues. I’m not mad, I know \nthat, it’s just this door is something else, and my father knows that. It’s why he \nused it as a cornerstone of his little story, but it’s just pretend. He just wants \nme to move back in with him, and I can’t. I just can’t. Sometimes, you just have \nto leave, even if what’s on the other side scares you. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 146 – Threshold \n \n8 \n \nARCHIVIST \nStatement ends. \nSo, it seems we did have Marcus MacKenzie’s statement after all. I spent so \nlong looking for it, back when I found his father’s, and no luck, but now I decide \nto start looking properly into Hill Top Road, and all of a sudden, I’m drawn to \nrearrange a filing cabinet, and what do I find behind it. \nI never thought I’d miss those days, when I could throw out some half-baked \nspeculation about drug abuse or mental illness and, woosh, away all the \nstatements went. There is nothing in the world more reassuring than \nignorance which we can mistake for certainty. But no, almost every one of \nthose statements, those people ... That poor old man. Like I can talk. Like I’m in \nany position to mourn the suffering of the innocent. \nBut there is one thing I know an awful lot better now than I did when I read his \nfather’s statement. I know an awful lot more about doors. \n[Tape clicks off. Tape clicks on. Angry door knocking, followed by an opening \ncreak.] \nHELEN \nYou rang? \nARCHIVIST \nMarcus MacKenzie. Why didn’t you tell me? \nHELEN \nIs that name supposed to mean something to me? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 146 – Threshold \n \n9 \n \nARCHIVIST \nNo, I suppose it wouldn’t, would it? Just an old man and his son for you to \nterrorise and feast on. \nHELEN \nAh, well, the son I was pursuing long before I was even Michael. And \ntechnically, I didn’t eat the old man. He passed away from terror before I even \ngot a chance to open properly. \nARCHIVIST \nAnd his son? Marcus? He was fine when I found his father’s statement two \nyears ago, but now, suddenly, I can’t get through to him. \nHELEN \nNo, I imagine not. I decided it was time to finish that game a few months ago. \nARCHIVIST \nYou... Why? \nHELEN \nNot sure. I suppose Helen didn’t have quite the same attachment to him as a \nproject. I’m not quite as much for decades-long campaigns of subtle terror \nthese days. \nARCHIVIST \nThat’s horrible. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 146 – Threshold \n \n10 \n \nHELEN \nIs it? We do what we need to do when it comes to feeding, don’t we? \n… \nDon’t we, Archivist? \nARCHIVIST \n(Softly) Yes. \nHELEN \nIt would be better if you embraced it. \nARCHIVIST \nThat’s not... Look, why were you trying to lure him into Hill Top Road? \nHELEN \nThat? Oh, well, that was just curiosity. I wanted to see what would happen. \nARCHIVIST \nI don’t understand. \nHELEN \nThere is something wrong with Hill Top Road – you know it as well as I do – \nsome strange scar in reality at the centre of whatever it is the spider is \nspinning. When young Mr MacKenzie passed, it seemed like a good \nopportunity for an experiment, to see what would happen if I lured him inside. \nBut it seems I just don’t have The Web’s gift for manipulation or persuasion. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 146 – Threshold \n \n11 \n \nARCHIVIST \nWere you controlled? \nHELEN \nWhat a delightful thought. I don’t believe so, no, but the Spider’s strings are \nsubtle, so I suppose it’s not impossible. Why? \nARCHIVIST \nI want to know. Can The Web control another avatar, one that serves a \ndifferent power? Make them do things they don’t want to. Make them find \nvictims, feed. \n(Helen laughs.) \nHELEN \nPerhaps. Perhaps not. Would that make life easier for you? Are you so sure you \ndidn’t want to? \n(Helen laughs again.) \n[The Archivist slams door. The tape clicks off. The tape clicks on.] \nARCHIVIST \nBeen a while since you’ve all come to see me together.
