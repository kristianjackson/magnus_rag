I still have a few \nthings to clear off over here, but I thought it would be best to let you know as \nsoon as possible. I am now certain my theory is correct. There is something \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 134 – Time of Revelation \n \n2 \n \nnew emerging, a fifteenth power. I didn’t want to believe it either, not at first, \nbut I was alerted a few months ago to the case of a woman named Bernadette \nDelcour. She works at the Faculté de Théologie at the university in Lille, and is \nan expert in eschatology, specifically failed apocalypse predictions. She had an \nencounter I believe is directly connected to the new emergence, and I \nmanaged to track her down. She was reluctant to talk, though I eventually \nmanaged to get the story out of her. \nBernadette had, apparently, received a call from a colleague in Paris about a \ndiscovery regarding Garland Hillier. Now, Hillier was a member of the Millerite \nmovement in upstate New York during the early 1840s. I don’t know how \nfamiliar you are with the Millerites, but they would eventually grow into the \nSeventh Day Adventist Church. They followed a preacher named William \nMiller, who believed he had calculated exactly when the end of days was \ncoming and pinned it down to October 22nd 1844. Now, Gertrude, I’m sure \nyou’ll have noticed that date came and went without any sign of Jesus \nreturning, and Miller’s followers noticed the very same thing, calling it “The \nGreat Disappointment”. Most of his followers stuck with him, and gradually \nturned into the Seventh Day Adventists, but Garland Hillier apparently took it \nharder than most, abandoning the movement and returning to his native \nFrance the following year. He spent the next twenty years publishing widely-\nderided collections of poetry, as well as essays on belief and atheism that were \nroundly ignored by the philosophical salons of the time. He was supported by \nseveral literary friends, as he was reputedly a gifted editor, even if his own \nwork was often all but incomprehensible. \nGarland Hillier’s final essay, published in 1867 and simply titled L’Avenir (The \nFuture) was supposedly a rambling and meandering speculation on the end of", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 0, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 2898}}
