You can drill down so small that you reach \nparticles and building blocks that your brain simply can’t connect to the \nphysical reality that you inhabit. The fact that the vast majority of your own \nbody is empty vacuum, space filled only with the weak forces that are binding \nyour disparate atoms to one another … that can only really be understood at \nan intellectual level. To really internalise that thought, to believe it, would be \ntoo much for most people. And at the other end, the sheer size at which the \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG106 ‘A Matter of Perspective’ \n \n2 \n \nuniverse operates literally cannot be fully conceptualised by the human mind. \nWe have to reduce it to factors, or long strings of comparative zeros. Most \npeople can’t even properly appreciate the size of our own planet, seeing it only \nin crudely rendered diagrams or maps. But compared to us, the planet is \nimmense, more than large enough for the swell of humanity to grow and \nultimately extinguish itself. Yet compared to the wider universe, it isn’t even a \nnoticeable speck. \n \nThe human mind would reflexively want to place us at the midway point, a \nperfect centre, balanced between the incredible size of the universe and the \nunthinkable smallness of the subatomic. But this is nothing but ego, a \nmanifestation of our obsession with considering ourselves some sort of \nnormative benchmark against which all else is measured. In truth, we are so \nmuch closer to the tiny, mindless atoms that make up our bodies than we are \nto a universe so enormous that fully imagining it is simply impossible. \n \nEven with all I’ve seen, I still can’t communicate it. I can’t make people actually \nunderstand how horridly, nauseatingly boundless this universe is, and when I \nthink of it too deeply I feel like I’m going to throw up, like a sort of existential \nvertigo. \n \nIt never used to scare me like this. I used to take a sort of comfort in it, in the \nthought that we were so small, such a minor blip in the life of the universe. \nWhere others saw insignificance and pointlessness, I found freedom. A sort of \noptimistic nihilism, I suppose? I know now it was all just denial, of course. It’s \nnot easy to be scared of something that you can’t even think about.
