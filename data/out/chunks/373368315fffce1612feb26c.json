I could only stare \nas thick rivulets of molten flesh flowed down my arm and onto the ground, and \nSandy’s body shook as though with laughter, even as my hand stayed encased \nin her warped and yielding head. I probably don’t need to describe how much \nit hurt. It would be a long time before I was able to use the hand again. \nAt last, I calmed down enough to pull my scalded, wax-encrusted hand from \nher head. She stood up, pressed her fingers to her face and calmly squeezed it \nback into shape. It didn’t look exactly the same as before, though there was no \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG089 – Twice as Bright \n12 \n \nmistaking the voice that came from her lips. She turned to Agnes, and nodded \nher approval. Agnes, for her part, had been talking this entire time, I realised, \nand somehow I had been listening. I knew what to do. \nNicholas Tregenza was the one that I chose. I had other colleagues I hated far \nmore, of course, and in many ways I might have even called Nick a friend, but… \nunlike so many of the others, he had a lot to live for. His wife Julie had just \ngiven birth to a squalling brat that he’d named Desmond – awful name for a \nbaby – and he’d saved enough money to move away from London entirely. \nHe’d just bought a house. When he spoke to me, he had hope in his face, and \nso much life in him, it still makes me smile to think about it. \nI invited him out for a drink to celebrate his good fortune, got him drunk, and \nstabbed him to death in a filthy alleyway near the edge of the Docklands. He \ndidn’t even have the wherewithal to look surprised. His skin didn’t yield as \neasily as Sandy’s had, but I suppose that’s what knives are for, isn’t it? \nAnd just like that, he was dead. And I felt no different. I had a minute of blind \npanic – how could I have been such an idiot? I hadn’t even planned ahead \nenough to consider how I might dump the body. I had just been so desperate \nto stoke the fire I still felt sputtering inside me. \nThen all at once, I saw the faintest tongues of smoke creeping around his body. \nIn an instant it was burning, and I was surrounded by that smell of matches \nand incense… mixed with an oily smell like cooking pork. And as he burned, I \nfelt my senses sharpen. My limbs were alive with searing energy, and my heart \nwas aglow with love; the agonising, terrifying love of something that I knew \nmust be a god. My god. The lightless inferno of desolation, of pain and \ndestruction. My tears of joy were nothing but steam. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG089 – Twice as Bright \n13 \n \nNick’s body didn’t completely burn to ash. Of course not, there needed to be \nsomething to identify. After all, what does my god care about death? It was the \ndestruction of his life that it hungered for, the agony and fear of his wife and \nchild, those that loved him, so they had to know that he was dead. Killed and \nmutilated in a pointless and unforeseeable act of unutterable violence. \nThen it was simply a matter of forging his signature on a few documents \nimplicating him in some very illegal transactions to get his assets stripped from \nhim. Oh, and burning down the new house, of course. And with each act of \nglorious, hateful destruction, I felt my god’s love embrace me, consume me, \ngive me life. Any feelings of pity or mercy I might have had for the poor woman \nI fed from were cauterised. \nJulie’s dead now, of course, though I do keep half an eye on their son \nDesmond: see if he has anything worth taking from him. \nAt first I channelled this new energy into my job and my relationship. Gretchen \nand I had never been happier as I moved from one success to the next. I think \nshe realised there was something else going on, though. Perhaps she \nsuspected how much my mind drifted to Agnes when I held her in my arms. I \nknow she wondered about how I started keeping petrol in the cupboard, and \nabout my newfound love of scented candles. \nBut she never asked. Never ever mentioned it. Perhaps on some level, she \nknew as well as I did where we were headed, but there are some things you \njust have to accept that in the end they’ll cause you pain. \nI should have been caught, really. For all that it gifted to me, my faith did little \nto hide my crimes beyond ensuring they were scoured of physical evidence. \nAnd I know the police were investigating a possible serial murderer targeting", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 3, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 4485}}
