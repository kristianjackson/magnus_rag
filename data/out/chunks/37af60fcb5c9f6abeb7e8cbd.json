The impact would drive me \ninto the wooded barrier, impaling me on fallen tree branch. The driver was \nkilled in the crash, and no-one else would pass by as I lay there, alone and \nscreaming for help, until my body finally gave up. It was quite particular about \nhow the jagged wood was going to feel as it passed through my torso. \nI closed the book and tried to understand what I had just read. It was a joke. It \nhad to be. A sick prank by someone who had clearly hated me far more than I \nhad expected. Phil had decided to kill himself, and had this made to harass me \nafterwards. It was the only explanation that made any sense. Besides, even if it \nwas somehow true and this thing could genuinely tell the future, my end was \nstill well over a decade away. Too far to be of any immediate worry. I simply \n\nwouldn’t go to Lancashire. Maybe ever. Certainly not in 2014. I had no idea \nwhat would even cause me to go there in the first place. So I did my best to \nignore it. For a while. \nIt played on my mind, though. I mean, how could it not? So I started to look \ninto some of the other deaths it detailed. Not obsessively, at least not at that \npoint, but I took the time to search online for a few of the names and how they \ndied. It wasn’t easy, as the book only ever gave first names, and most of them \npre-dated online records by a long time. Eventually, though, I found one. \nAlexander, so the book claimed, had died in 1983, after his home was broken \ninto. He was stabbed seven times in his bed before his throat was sliced open. \nThe entry went so far as to assure me that the murderer was never identified \nor caught. Well, after a little bit of digging, I found him. Alexander Willard. It \nwas an article on the history of the small town of Alcester, near Stratford-\nupon-Avon. It was focused on the darker aspects of the area’s history, and \ndetailed the few ghosts that supposedly haunted the area. Tucked at the end \nof the piece was the mention of a strange unsolved murder that had taken \nplace in 1983, where a local mechanic named Alexander Willard had been \nkilled in his bed. No culprit was ever found, and no motive for the crime was \never determined. \nOf course, that didn’t prove anything. Not really. Only that whoever had \nwritten the book had really done their research. There was nothing to it but a \nlot of time and energy that had, for some reason, gone towards the sole \npurpose of scaring me. If it was true, if it was real, and Phil had it in his \npossession, surely he could have read of his own demise and taken steps to \navoid it. I turned back to the page for my own death, the sickening desire to re-\n\nread the details gnawing at me. And that was when everything I thought I \nknew crumbled. Because the page had changed. \nThe words were as solid and unmoving as they always had been, but now it \ntold me that I died in London. In 2012. I was apparently renting a flat in Bethnal \nGreen with a faulty gas main. The gas had built up undetected, and when I \ntried to light to oven to cook a piece of salmon, it exploded and set the whole \nplace alight. I was to be admitted to the Royal London Hospital Emergency \nDepartment with third degree burns over seventy percent of my body, where I \ndied nineteen hours later. \nMy whole body was shaking at this point. I threw the book across the room \nand left. I walked for hours, no idea in which direction. It wasn’t possible. I was \nlosing it. It was the only explanation. But I knew that I was as sane as I ever had \nbeen. When did it change? Was it when I turned back to read it again? Or \nperhaps when I had made the decision to never visit Lancashire? If the book \nknew the future, then how much did it know me? My decisions and choices \nwere my own, so was it responding to them or simply to the fact that I opened \nthe book again? Perhaps it changed every time I opened it, even if I didn’t read \nthe page, every interaction changing my fate, though none, it seemed, made it \nless horrible. \nI went to stay with a friend of mine, John Kendrick, for a few days. He could see \nsomething was wrong, and thankfully didn’t ask me about it, instead just trying \nto cheer me up. I tried to forget it, to ignore what I had read but it’s not the \nsort of thing that ever truly leaves your mind, and eventually I found myself \nback in that lonely house, staring at that damned book.
