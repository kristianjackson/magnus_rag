The satisfaction of surrounding them, \nsuffocating them, reaching down into them and drinking in their panic as \nbreath failed them. \n[Thunder and night insects fade away; squirming remains] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nAnd as they grew to learn their place within the world, the pathetic \nmeagreness of their own existence, they could not spin a story rich or grand \nenough to fully hide their own awful insignificance, lost and alone in the \nterrible greatness of the universe. And by the time these minds had reached a \npoint of intricacy to lie and scheme and puppet one other, they had also \nlearned to conceive of war. \n[Drumbeats pound a sinister call] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 200 – Last Words \n12 \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nAnd as the things that were fear hovered at the edge of the world, the flowing \nhorror of these minds nourished them, swelling some and withering others, \npushing and pulling the shattered, swirling mass of terror into ever newer and \nundiscovered forms. \n[Soft whispers join the drums] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nAnd something else began to happen. Some minds did not simply recoil from \nthem and feed them. Some seemed almost to call them, to court them, to \nhunger for them in return. Minds that saw the faces of the things that were \nfear, and were compelled as much as they were repulsed. Whether or not they \nknew what it was they did, they called out. And they were answered. \n[Drums fade leaving behind the whispering] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nTime is different for fear, and it cannot be said exactly who was the first to \nopen themselves and be filled with the power of terror. A hermit, huddled in a \npitch-black cave through winter, who emerged and brought the depth of night \nwith him wherever he trod. A pestilent chieftain who found her breath \nsloughed from her body and rotted whatever it touched. A warrior driven from \ntheir village, who found their face as smooth and shifting as the sands of their \nhome. Which came first does not matter, the unseen gap was bridged, and the \nthin veil between the world that was and the things that were fear had been \ntorn, ever so slightly. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 200 – Last Words \n13 \n[Whispers are joined by ethereal singing; the same music that once \ncame from the Coffin artifact] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nAnd with this tear, they grew stronger, bolder, pouring themselves into the \nworld and creating monsters. \n[Whispers start to fade away] \n[Growls from different directions; a rattling and hissing cry; deep \npulsing sounds; all sound… familiar] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nLong things that wore you like a suit, smiling things that stripped you from your \nbones, unseen things that watched and watched and watched and never left \nyou. And with each new creation, each new servant, the Fears reached further \nand fed the things that made them. \nAnd with this newfound power came greed. The hunger for more, the \nunformed, unfocused, but impossibly huge desire to exist. To join the minds \nthat gave them shape and purpose, and finally drink their fill ‘til they were one \nand the same. They had no concept of how, or when, or even why, but they \nneeded it. They needed it. \n[The ethereal singing comes to the fore] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nAnd so the things that were fear began to sing, to draw ever more multitudes \nto them, to shape them and push them and beg them for freedom.
