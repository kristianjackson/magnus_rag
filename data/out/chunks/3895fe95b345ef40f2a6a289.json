The Magnus Archives. Episode one hundred and eighty-\neight: \"Centre of Attention.\" \n[Theme finishes] \n[Tape clicks on] \n[Martin and the Archivist walk on pavement] \n[Suburban sounds: automated sprinklers, distant dog barks, the far-\noff sound of urban traffic; these sounds repeat as they travel] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 188 – Centre of Attention \n \n2 \nMARTIN \nHow much longer? Feels like we’ve been walking through suburbs forever. \nARCHIVIST \nWell, quite. \nMARTIN \nAh. Right. Okay. Literal suburban hellscape, then? \nARCHIVIST \nYes. Endless, cookie-cutter housing. Impersonal, alienating. A common \nexpression of The Lonely even before the world went to hell. \nMARTIN \nI guess. \nSeems a bit, I don’t know... a bit tame compared to some of the other stuff, \nthough. \nARCHIVIST \nI mean, not to be, uh... That isn’t exactly a surprise, is it? That The Lonely \nseems comfortable to you? \nMARTIN \nGuess not. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 188 – Centre of Attention \n \n3 \nARCHIVIST \nBut if you think there’s a lack of violence or suffering, then I’m afraid you’re \nmistaken. There’s plenty, it’s just… hidden. Trapped behind identical doors and \ndown silent streets of unknown neighbours. The suffering here is deep. And it’s \nprivate. \nMARTIN \nO-Okay, yeah, I get it. So, I guess we’re looking for an empty house? \nSomewhere to... ‘unburden yourself’? \nARCHIVIST \nActually no. Helen— Th-The Distortion, turns out that was… a lot of fear for the \nEye. And, uh... \nMARTIN \nYou’re still full? \nARCHIVIST \nI suppose that’s one way to put it. \n(Beat) \nMARTIN \nYou still haven’t really explained what happened there. \nARCHIVIST \nShe tried to trap me in the corridors, so I destroyed her. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 188 – Centre of Attention \n \n4 \nMARTIN \nYeah, I, I know, but, I mean... why? \nARCHIVIST \nProbably because I told her I was going to kill her. \nMARTIN \nYeah, that’d do it. Was it that bad in there? \nARCHIVIST \nThere were a lot of people suffering. \nMARTIN \nBut that’s not why you did it. \nARCHIVIST \nShe was... She was too dangerous. She was only ever playing us. \nMARTIN \nSo all that talk of wanting to be friends, she was just, what, lying? \nARCHIVIST \nNo… That was real. She did want to be friends. But she also wanted us \nsuspicious, off-balance, uncomfortable. She wanted to be able to hurt us. \nMARTIN \nI mean… bit of a contradiction, surely? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 188 – Centre of Attention \n \n5 \nARCHIVIST \nIs it? She wanted to be our friend, she just didn’t want to be a good friend. \nMARTIN \nHuh. She couldn’t help what she was, I guess. \nARCHIVIST \nShe didn’t even try. \nMARTIN \nI hope the others don’t take it too hard. Melanie was pretty close to her at one \npoint. Assuming Melanie’s still alive, of course. \nARCHIVIST \nYeah. I thought you and Helen got on well, though? \nMARTIN \nYeah, I… I-I dunno, really. She always seemed to know just the right thing to \nsay, or the wrong thing, kind of. Like, sh-she had a way of getting into your \nhead and making you feel like you didn’t know what the deal was. Like, like you \nwere being stupid or something. \nARCHIVIST \nSounds about right. \nMARTIN \nPlus, I... I was a little bit jealous as well. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 188 – Centre of Attention \n \n6 \nARCHIVIST \nOf what? \nMARTIN \nOf Helen. Well, the real Helen. I found the tape when you were on the run \nand... I don’t know. Something about the way you two seemed to connect \nwhen she came in. \nARCHIVIST \nBefore she was eaten by a door. \nMARTIN \nWell, Yeah. It certainly seemed to have a pretty deep impact on you. \nARCHIVIST \nIt did. I think... I mean, you remember how I was back then, how paranoid. The \nNot!Sasha was there, and I could sense something wasn’t right, but I just \ncouldn’t place it. Left me a suspicious wreck. Then when Helen Richardson \ncame in, it seemed like… she was in the same place I was, but worse, further \nalong. I thought, maybe if I could help her, that would mean... maybe I wasn’t \nbeyond help? \n(Beat) \nMARTIN \nI’m sorry for how it worked out.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 0, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 4450}}
