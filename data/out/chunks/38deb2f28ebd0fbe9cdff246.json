I hadn’t even \nstarted when I left. I just felt guilty. Like it was an admission of failure. Eleven \nyears I’d been going, all natural, and, physically, I was at the top of my game. I \ndid well in competitions, I felt healthy, I was pretty much the ideal weight for \nmy height, but when I looked in the mirror I still didn’t see what I wanted to. \nMy muscles were smooth and rounded, not like the, the veined, bulging forms \nI idolised. Even when I spent weeks dieting before a competition, without an \nounce of body fat, I, I just couldn’t get there. I’d reached my natural peak, and \nit wasn’t enough for me. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG090 – Body Builder \n6 \n \nSo, I did my research, and ordered a cycle of steroids online. I didn’t want to be \nunsafe, so I made sure I got a full check-up from my doctor before I started, \nthough obviously I didn’t mention why. Everything came back fine, so all that \nwas left was to find a new gym where nobody would mind me taking them. \nThis was harder than it should have been, mostly because of my own \nstandards. Plenty of places had an ‘official’ policy banning drugs onsite and just \ndidn’t enforce it. To me, though, the whole point of moving gyms was that I \ndidn’t want to have to hide like a criminal, or pretend to think what I was doing \nwas wrong. I wanted somewhere I could be honest about who I was and what I \nwanted to be. \nEventually I found it, weirdly enough, in the Yellow Pages. Online searches \nhadn’t shown anywhere promising near my home on the outskirts of \nAberdeen, so I thought I might as well try the phone book. As you’d expect, \nmost of the listings just pointed me towards the their websites, but I spotted a \nsmall, square ad box in the lower left corner. It was text only, and read, “Your \nperfect body is here. Become all you can be.” Followed by a landline number \nand an address about five minutes walk from me. So I gave them a call. \nThe voice that answered was rough and spoke in the sort of English accent that \nusually gets my hackles up, but when I asked him what the gym’s policy on \nsteroids was, he just laughed, and said that if it helped me “perfect myself” \nthen it was more than welcome. I arranged to swing by the following day and \ncheck the place out. \nFrom the outside the gym wasn’t much to look at. Just the faded outline of a \ndumbbell on a grimy window, and the words “Weights and Cardio” just about \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG090 – Body Builder \n7 \n \nreadable over the door. I realised that I actually passed this place pretty \nregularly, I’d just always assumed it was out of business. \nThe door was open, though, so I went inside. It was a hot day, but the air in the \nreception was cool, tinged with that familiar scent of sweat, and something \nelse I couldn’t quite identify. There wasn’t anyone behind the desk, and the \ncomputer didn’t look like it had been turned on all day. I was about to call out, \nsee if I could get somebody’s attention, when I heard the door to the changing \nrooms open, and someone stepped out. \nThe man who stood there was, without a doubt, the biggest guy I had ever \nseen, and bear in mind I spend my time hanging out with bodybuilders. He had \nto hunch down to fit through the doorway, and was almost twice as wide as I \nwas. Most of his body was covered in a loose tracksuit, and I could see clear \nstitch marks where it had been enlarged for him. Embroidered onto the chest \nwas the letter ‘J’. \nDespite his enormous size, his face seemed pretty normal, even handsome, \nwith the sort of cheekbones and jawline I’d kill for. He smiled when I \nstammered out a hello, and asked if I was Ross from the phone. Sure, I said, \nand he immediately launched into all sorts of questions about my workout, \nwhat I was looking for, what safety measures I had for my steroids, that sort of \nthing. None of it was unexpected, and he clearly knew his stuff. \nBut then he started asking me some slightly more personal questions: why I’d \nbecome a bodybuilder, how it made me feel, what parts of myself I hated. It \nfelt a bit… invasive, but I answered honestly, and he seemed satisfied, turning \naround and gesturing for me to follow as he headed in to show me around.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 1, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 4274}}
