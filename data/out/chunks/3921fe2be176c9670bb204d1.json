I grabbed a \nquick bite of cold sausage for breakfast, got my big torch and a small prybar, \nthen headed out into the morning. \nThe rain had stopped but the sun still hadn’t come out and the wet shine \nseemed to weigh heavily on everything. There was nobody on the street. Most \nwere probably at work already. The old takeaway sat there, the letters of \n‘FOOD’ now grey and lifeless. For a second I thought I saw the red neon ‘GRILL’ \nsign flicker, but I’m pretty sure that was just my imagination, as I know the \ntubes were busted. I slipped around the side and found the metal panel \ncovering the window was still ajar. I’m a bit bigger than a \n\nscrawny teen vandal, but it didn’t take much coaxing before there was a gap \nwide enough for me to squeeze my way inside. \nThe air was cold and clean. I was in what must have been the storeroom and \nfood prep area. There wasn’t much light filtering through the tiny holes over \nthe windows, so I turned my torch on and cast it about. It looked like anything \nperishable had been removed from the place, but other than that it seemed \nuntouched. Sealed cans of pickled vegetables, vats of oil, rows and rows of \nclean, shining equipment. There wasn’t a speck of dust on any of it, though it \ncertainly didn’t seem like it was in use. \nMy torch moved over the rest of the room until it fell upon the huge freezer. \nThere were letters sprayed onto it, several inches high. It looked like this was \nwhat the kid had been doing. He’d been spraying the phrase ‘MEAT IS MEAT’ \nonto the door of the freezer, but the cops must have gotten him before he’s \nfinished, so what was actually written upon the matt silver surface were the \nwords ‘MEAT IS ME’. \nI’m not going to pretend that a shiver didn’t run right through me. It made me \nfeel ever so faintly ill. In a fit of stubbornness, I decided that the only way to \ndispel this fear was to open the freezer. To know for sure that there was \nnothing inside. No meat of any sort. I walked over with a confidence I didn’t \nreally feel and gripped the handle. I took a breath and pulled. Inside the \nfreezer... was absolutely nothing. No meat, no ice, not even a chill. It hadn’t \nbeen on in years. I let a sigh of relief. Which is when I heard a very quiet \nlaughter from next to my feet. \nI shined my light down and saw a face looking up at me from underneath the \ncounter behind me. The face belonged to a gaunt, pale Chinese man, who \n\nlooked up at me with a terrifying glee. In his spindly hands he held a pair of \nbolt cutters, with the blades positioned either side of my ankle. I barely had \ntime to register this when he pulled them closed, cutting through my Achilles \ntendon. There was an intense spike of agony and I fell forward hard, smacking \nmy head on the side of the counter. And... everything went dark. \nWhen my eyes snapped open, I was laid out on a wooden floor. I couldn’t \nmove and, by the plastic I could feel digging into my flesh, I assumed I had \nbeen bound with cable ties. My ankle throbbed with pain, though not as \nsharply as I would have expected. The room was small and mostly bare, and \nlooking at the windows I guessed I was on the upper floor of the old takeaway. \nA few shreds of fading sunlight were filtering in through the covered windows, \nbut most of the light in the room came from a trio of oddly textured candles a \nfew feet from my head. \nI strained my neck to look around the room. It seemed devoid of furniture but \ndotted around seemed to be small piles of bric-a-brac. I saw chipped teacups, a \nstack of what looked like old bibles and then something that made my breath \ncatch in my throat. A small pile of human fingers. I could feel a despairing \nmoan escape my chest before I could do anything to stop it. At this, there was \nmovement behind me and the man I had seen earlier stepped into view. He \nwas shirtless, and the glow of the candles seemed to illuminate in stark \nshadow how painfully thin he seemed. He was chewing thoughtfully on \nsomething, though I couldn’t see what, and held a long, sharp butcher’s knife \nin his hand. \nI tried to say something, but the words caught in my throat. What the hell are \nyou supposed to say in that sort of situation? After a minute or two, he \nswallowed whatever he had been eating in a swift gulping motion, like an owl", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 3, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 4361}}
