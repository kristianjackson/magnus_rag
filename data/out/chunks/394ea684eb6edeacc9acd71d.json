Basira Hussain \nrecording. \nStatement begins. \nBASIRA (STATEMENT) \n\nOkay, I know how it sounds, but Murder Club wasn’t supposed to be like this. It \nwas just true crime stuff. My boyfriend, well, ex-boyfriend, used to call it my \n“serial killer fan club”, which I’ll admit doesn’t make it sound a lot better, but \nyou’ve gotta believe there was no way any of us would have chosen to get \ninvolved in anything like what’s happening. \nExcept, I guess, that we did. Somehow. \nI’m not a violent person, not at all. My sisters used to play fight when we were \nkids, and I’d always just… I’d end up crying in the corner. But for some reason, \ntrue crime never had that effect on me. Or maybe it did, but I kind of liked it \nwhen I could control it. I remember when I first got the taste. I stumbled across \na book on famous murders that had somehow ended up in our school library. I \nread about Lizzie Borden, feeling the breath catch in my throat, and I put the \nbook away quickly before literally running out of the library. I didn’t sleep at all \nthat night, but I still went back to that book the next day. \nIt’s always scared me. That’s the thing. I could never get into horror; ghosts \nand monsters always left me bored. Even thrillers never really got me in the \nsame way. But there was just a part of me that always knew it wasn’t real, it \nnever happened. But true crime? The awful stuff that humans do to one \nanother? That got me. I used to think it was about facing the darkness, and \ncoming to terms with my fear, or somehow honouring the victims, but it’s not. \nIt’s just that there’s a part of me that gets an awful little buzz from it. From \nthat shudder that goes through my body when I’m getting all the gory details \nof how someone died at the hands of a real-life human monster. \nBooks, podcasts, documentaries, I… I went through all of them all, and still \nwanted more. And then I found Murder Club. \n\nWell, it’s more that I founded Murder Club. Co-founded, at least. And Murder \nClub wasn’t an official name or anything, it’s just what we called it. We all met \nthrough one of those meetup websites, I-I forget which one. It was about three \nyears ago, and I’d just moved to London, so… \nI tended to trawl a bunch of them to try and find things to do, places I might \nmake some new friends. This one was advertised as the first meeting of a \n“True Crime Discussion and Reading Group”, and as you might have guessed by \nnow, that was right up my street. We met up, had a great time discussing a \nbook on Tillie Klimek, and decided to make it a regular event. Pretty soon \nMurder Club was meeting up every other week. A few of us wanted to do it \nweekly, but Jamie was a slow reader and didn’t think he could keep up. We’d \noccasionally all see each other outside the regular meetings if we were \nwatching a new documentary together or something like that. Once, we even \nwent on a day trip to the True Crime Museum in Hastings. \nLet’s see, at the moment it’s me, Jamie Sanders, Ananya Kaleka, who we were \nall founding members, and then there’s Ananya’s wife Evelyn, Andrew \nCochrane, who I invited him from work, and Debbie Truss, who joined us about \na year ago, but… I don’t remember where from. \nThere used to be more, but people… come and go. So, six of us at the moment. \nWell, I suppose three. Evelyn, Jamie and Debbie are already dead, so I don’t \nknow how much you’d call them ‘current members’, but you know what I \nmean. \nI really don’t know how it all happened. This ‘jump’ from morbid book club to \nactual murder came so quickly. This time last week I was finishing up a memoir \nby a retired FBI profiler, getting ready for Murder Club the next evening; now", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 0, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 4225}}
