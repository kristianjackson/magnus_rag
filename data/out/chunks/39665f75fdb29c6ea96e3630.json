Whether the windows were \ndarker than they should have been, or if the frame of the place was… heavier. I \ndon’t know. Hard to tell, I was too busy trying to manoeuvre the keys without \nhaving to put my bag down on the waterlogged path. It wasn’t until I actually \ngot through the door that anything seemed to be at all wrong. \nEven then it was only small things. Easy to ignore. I’m not superstitious, never \nused to be at least, so how dim the lights were made me think the owners \nwere cheap; maybe they’d decided to go all-in on those weak energy-saving \nbulbs. The cold? I just thought it was an empty house that hadn’t turned the \n\nheating on yet. The small movements of the dust covers... that was the first \nthing that actually caught my attention. \nThe owners of the house had already filled it with furniture. Not good \nfurniture, of course: just the cheapest IKEA had that wouldn’t collapse under \nthe weight of a textbook. It was all assembled, though, and… covered with \nthick sheets of white plastic, to try and keep the dust off. \nNot a strange sight in my line of work, so I just ignored it, and headed down to \nthe kitchen to start wiping down the surfaces. \nI don’t know why I always like to start in the kitchen; Iit sort of feels like the \nheart of a home, at least to me, and I like to begin there and work outwards. \nOr maybe I just like food, and by the time I start on a job, I’m usually already \nhungry for lunch. That said, the sort of houses I usually clean, I’m more likely to \nlose that appetite when I stumble on something in the kitchen. This one was \nalready almost pristine, though. A bit of dust on the surfaces, some careless \nflecks of paint was the worst I had to contend with. Even the oven was spotless \nand new. But as I was wiping down the sink, I sort of zoned out. The window in \nthe kitchen looked out over the garden, and… I froze as I noticed that in the \ncentre, there was a tree. It was still bare from the winter, and from the top of \nit, there were these eight thick branches, just stretching out at all angles, \nsome… reaching up to the sky, and some… it felt like they were reaching \ntowards me. It was almost black against the dark grey sky, and the rain made it \nshine. My mouth was dry, and I suddenly had this… vision in my head, of \nwalking out the back door, and standing at the base of that tree, as those \nbranches bent, and snapped, and came down to grab me. But I was in the \nkitchen, and I was still dry. I finished up quickly, and headed off to do the rest \nof the house. \n\nI tried to ignore it, just told myself I was having a weird bit of paranoia. Getting \nmyself worked up over nothing. I don’t believe in ghosts, you know, and even if \nI did, it was a new house. It’s not like anyone’s building over ancient burial \ngrounds in East Oxford. But even then I was finding it hard to ignore the \nmovements. Slight rustles in the dust sheets that covered the furniture. \nShadows they made that didn’t… quite work with the shape they should be. Or \nthis lump or angle, sometimes, so I’d wonder if they were just covering chairs. \nWhenever I turned around I swear I heard them shift, and when I looked back, \nI can’t be sure, but I think they would be different, covering something \ndifferent. I never got the nerve up to take any of them off, though. I just \npressed on, tried to get the place clean and finished as quick as I could. Living \nroom, bathroom, upstairs bedrooms… it was almost getting dark by the time I \nwas finished. \nIt was such a relief as I started to pack up my bag, and I was just about to zip it \nclosed when I remembered the cupboard under the stairs. It hadn’t been \nincluded in the job list, but in most houses I cleaned I liked to give the storage \nspaces a bit of a tidy and a vacuum as well. It always brought up by my \nemployers as ‘evidence of my thoroughness’, and I took a lot of pride in it. \nBut in my hurry to be finished and out of Hill Top Road, I hadn’t even checked \nit. I looked at the small door, then back to my half-zipped bag, and… I decided \nto just take a quick look. Just a quick look. It was a new house. How dirty could \nit be? \nObviously it was my decision. I remember the little handle was warm. I don’t \nknow if that’s just my memory playing tricks on me, but I do remember that. It \nopened to reveal stairs going down into a basement. Nobody had mentioned a \nbasement.
