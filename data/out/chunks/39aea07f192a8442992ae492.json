Episode eight-nine. Twice as Bright. \n[The Magnus Archives Theme – Intro – continued] \n[Tape clicks on.] \nARCHIVIST \nSomething funny, Ms. Perry? \nJUDE \nUh, yeah. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG089 – Twice as Bright \n2 \n \nARCHIVIST \nCare to share? \nJUDE \nI think it’s pretty obvious. \nARCHIVIST \nLook, I lost my normal coat, and i-it’s cold. Some of us actually feel it, you \nknow? \nJUDE \nYou wouldn’t shake my hand. \nARCHIVIST \nWell, no, I’m not stupid! Whatever the Lightless Flame is – L-Look, will you stop \nthat?! \nJUDE \n(Laughs) Oh, alright. Ah… I hate explaining jokes, but, um… Imagine you’re, \num… a butcher, and one day an injured little lamb walks into your workshop, \nand strides right into one of the mincing machines, but when you go up to it, \nknife in hand, it shakes its head and tells you “I’m not stupid”. Do you get why \nthat’s funny? \nARCHIVIST \nRight. But no more abattoir metaphors, please. \nJUDE \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG089 – Twice as Bright \n3 \n \nSuppose it’s not really me, is it? Would you rather be a really stupid piece of \nfirewood? \nARCHIVIST \nI just have a few questions. Did you burn down a section of Gwydir Forest last \nyear? \nJUDE \nNot alone, but yes. You should have seen how devastated they were, such a \nloss. \nARCHIVIST \nI’m sure the Forestry Commission were mortified. Why? \nJUDE \nStop that! And it was because Nikola Orsinov asked us to. She was done with \nthe place, and we’re always happy to help, when that help is destroying \nsomething someone loves. \nARCHIVIST \nBut – \nJUDE \nNo more questions, Archivist! \nARCHIVIST \nI just… er, you were a friend of Agnes Montague, correct? \nJUDE \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG089 – Twice as Bright \n4 \n \nShe’s not one of your little stories. \nARCHIVIST \nAccording to the statement of Jack Barnabas, she very much is. \nJUDE \nThe burnt-face little runt? He got what was coming to him. Just like… \nARCHIVIST \nYes, yes, I understand, you could easily kill me, I’m at your mercy, blah, blah, \nblah. I have heard it before. And from things much scarier than you. \nJUDE \nThat a fact? \nARCHIVIST \nOkay, so… why haven’t you done it? \nJUDE \nWe’re in public. \nARCHIVIST \nWell, you’re not – You’re hardly keeping your voice down. \nJUDE \nYou talk about god and death and demons nice and loud, and watch people \nbend over backwards not to listen to what you’re saying. No-one cares. \nARCHIVIST \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG089 – Twice as Bright \n5 \n \nIf you say so. \nJUDE \nAre you trying to talk me into killing you? If I wanted, I could reach through \nyour chest like runny wax, and hold your heart while it cooked. No-one would \neven notice, if I didn’t give you time to scream. \nARCHIVIST \nRight. R-right. So why don’t you? Does your ‘god’ not want you to? \nJUDE \nHard to say. When I look at you I feel that burning liquid pain, eager to flow out \nand purify your rotten carcass, but I feel that a lot. \nARCHIVIST \nOh. M-More or less than normal? \nJUDE \nHard to say when every nerve ending’s on fire. Hard to tell degrees. \nARCHIVIST \nThird degree, maybe? Oh! Sorry, sorry, it was a… I have a god too, right? \nJUDE \nIs that another joke? \nARCHIVIST \nN-No, I… I’m new to this. Everyone keeps calling me ‘Archivist”, like I’m special, \nand that… that I serve the Eye. Trying to kill me for it.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 0, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 3755}}
