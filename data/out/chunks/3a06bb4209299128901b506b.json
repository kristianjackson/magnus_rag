It’s not that I can’t remember, it’s just that I \ncan’t really tell. When I manage to steal an hour or so, if that’s even happened, \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG074 – Fatigue \n2 \n \nmy dreams seem so vivid and my waking so disjointed, that they blur together. \nLike all I have are scenes and images, devoid of context, and no true way to tell \nwhat is real and what is not. \nI’m lying in my bed. It’s hot. I know the central heating is off but the air still has \nthat dry warmth that scratches your throat. I want to get up, to move, but my \nbody is too tired, all the strength in it gone. I just lie there, watching the ceiling \nfan spin round and around and around, a dull whirring that grinds against my \nbrain. It is dark outside, and the only light is the glow from my small bedside \nlamp. As I watch it, my eyes adjusting to the motion, the fan slows. It loses its \nmomentum gradually, until at last it is completely still and there is silence. I \nwait, and it begins to turn again in the other direction. Now spinning \nanticlockwise, it accelerates until the blades are once again a blur. I do not \nremember my flat having a ceiling fan when I moved in. \nI’ve always had problems sleeping. Even as a child, my mother would always \ncheck my room to find me reading well into the night. If I heard her coming up \nthe stairs, I would turn off my light and dive beneath the covers to try and \nconvince her I was sound asleep. If it worked, I would listen to her walk off to \nher room, and then bring out my book once again. At the time I thought it was \nbecause I loved reading, but looking back I think it must have been the first \nstirrings of insomnia. \nThere is a billboard outside my flat. It overlooks a small roundabout and used \nto have adverts for whatever the latest TV drama was. The metal that holds it \nup is old and rusted, and sometimes I think I can hear it groaning ever so \nquietly as I walk past. Now it has an advert for coffee. I assume that is what it’s \nadvertising. It’s a woman, bright and cheerful, with a sky-blue blouse and \nshining white smile.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 0, "chunk_count": 5, "chars": 2782}}
