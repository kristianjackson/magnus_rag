Written below it were \nthree lines, in fine green calligraphy: “Grant us the sight that we may not \nknow. Grant us the scent that we may not catch. Grant us the sound that we \nmay not call.” \nAt this point Mary Keay returned with two cups of tea. I hadn’t even noticed \nher leave nor had I requested the cup of black tea she pressed into my hand. \nShe asked if I liked the painting and told me that her Gerard had done it. Said \nhe was a very talented artist. I mumbled something approving, I don’t \nremember exactly what, and looked at the cup of tea in my hand. She hadn’t \noffered me any milk, and was now busily searching the shelves again, her own \ncup forgotten on the desk. I tried to drink the stuff out of politeness, but it \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG004 – Page Turner \n10 \n \ntasted foul, like dust and smoke. I think it might have once been lapsang \nsouchong, but if so it must have been years old. \nFinally, Mary seemed to find the book she was looking for and took it from the \nshelf. She handed me a book that, at first glance, appeared to be almost \nidentical to my copy of Ex Altiora, \nexcept that the leather was in slightly better condition. There was no title on \nthis one, but opening it I could see that it was written in letters I didn’t \nrecognise. There were no illustrations in this book, and the only English words I \ncould find were on the bookplate: “From the library of Jurgen Leitner”. Just like \nmine. Mary told me that the writing was in Sanskrit, but when I asked her if \nshe could read it she just started laughing. \nShe took the book back and walked over to the desk where the room’s single \nunshaded light bulb cast stark shadows across the floor. She very deliberately \nheld the book in those shadows for a few seconds and then handed it back to \nme. I noticed for the first time that the heavy metal music was no longer \nplaying, and the room was utterly silent. I opened the book, and for a few \nseconds was confused to see that nothing seemed to have changed. The \nwriting was still unintelligible to me and it felt no different. I lifted it to have a \ncloser look, and as I did I heard something clatter lightly onto the floor. I \nlooked down to see bones. Small animal bones, from what I can tell, but each \none was slightly bent and warped into shapes that bones should not form. As I \nstared at them, Mary Keay took the book back from me and passed it through \nthe shadows once again. More bones fell. She did this several times, until there \nwas a small pile formed at my feet. \nI didn’t know what to say.
