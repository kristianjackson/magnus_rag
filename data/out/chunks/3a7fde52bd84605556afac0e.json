Not many came through the entirety \nof the war in one piece. And if you discount the burns, then I did indeed do just \nthat. Even fewer spent all four years at the front, like I did. I was never sent for \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG00X – The Piper \n2 \n \ntreatment for shell shock or injury, and even my encounter with a German \nflamethrower only ended up with me in a front line hospital at Wipers. I was \nstill in that field hospital when the fighting started at the Somme, so I suppose \nthat was lucky too. Four years… I sometimes feel like I’m the only one who saw \nthe whole damn show from start to finish, as though I alone know the Great \nWar in all its awful glory. But deep down I know that honour, such as it is, has \nto go to Wilfred. You wouldn’t have thought it from his poems, but all told his \ntime at the front totalled not much over a year. Yet he got to know the war in a \nway I never did. He’s certainly the only person I know that ever saw The Piper. \nI grew up poor on the streets of Salford, so I joined the army as soon as I was \nold enough. I know you’ve heard the stories of brave lads signing up at 14, but \nthis was before the war started, so there wasn’t such a demand for manpower \nand the recruiters were much more scrupulous about making sure those \nenlisting were of age. Even so, I was almost too skinny for them to take me and \nbarely made the required weight. But in the end I made it through and, after \nmy training, was assigned to the Manchester Regiment, 2nd Battalion, and it \nwasn’t long before we were shipped off to France with the British \nExpeditionary Force. You seem like educated sorts, so I’m sure you read in the \npapers how that went. Soon enough, though, the trenches were dug and the \nboredom started to set in. Now, boredom is fine, understand, when the \nalternatives are bombs, snipers and gas attacks, but months at a time sitting in \na waterlogged hole in the ground, hoping your foot doesn’t start swelling, \nwell… it has a quiet terror all its own. \nWilfred came to us in July of 1916. I’m not intimately familiar with his history \nbut he clearly came from stock good enough to be assigned as a probationary \nSecond Lieutenant. I was a Sergeant at the time, so had the job of giving him", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 0, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 3097}}
