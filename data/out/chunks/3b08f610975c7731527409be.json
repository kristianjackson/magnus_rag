By this point I was \nstarting to suspect that I may have been having hallucinations of some sort, \nbut I had never before felt a... a presence within myself, inside my being. It was \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG020 – Desecrated Host \n2 \n \na feeling so utterly awful it’s hard to put it into words. Like a reflex reaction, \nyour muscles moving without any instruction from your mind, but rather than \na quick twitch of the leg, it’s a slow movement of your jaw, your lips, forming \nyour mouth into words. Worse things were to come, of course, but I don’t \nthink any of them were so profoundly unsettling as that feeling. \nI only got a few streets away from Hill Top Road before I was no longer able to \nmaintain my equilibrium and fell to the floor, violently throwing up. I could not \ndeny then that there was something inside me, and I believed that whatever it \nwas had entered me from Bethany O’Connor. I tried to pray, tried to cast my \nmind to G– I couldn’t. As I tried, my throat closed and I struggled to breathe. I \nlay on the side of the pavement, and I wept. Wiping my eyes, I took out my \nBible, and looked desperately within it for comfort but when I opened it, \nthough the page was within the Gospel of Luke, the words were from Genesis: \n“Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the earth; and from \nthy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth; and \nit shall come to pass, that every one that findeth me shall slay me.” \nAround that passage the writing morphed and swam before my eyes. And \nwherever there were words that might give me comfort, I found them \nobscured by dark stains. The bile began to rise within my throat again, and I \ndesperately wanted to hurl the book away from me. I held it, though, for just a \nmoment before I placed the small volume once again in my jacket. It took \nmore willpower than I could have believed, but I kept it. I stood up shakily, and \nstaggered back to the presbytery. \nI slept for a long time, and missed morning Mass, saying I was feeling unwell. It \nwasn’t a lie, of course; I just lay there for hours. There seemed a safety in \nstillness, as though inaction could do no harm. It was the first good decision I", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 0, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 3200}}
