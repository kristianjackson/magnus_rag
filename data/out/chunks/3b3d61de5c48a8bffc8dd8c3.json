Another victim of your warped games? Or \nwere you simply drawn like a vulture? Or maybe a shark sensing blood.

Well, that’s not exactly true. I don’t know \ntheir identity, but I’ve seen them. Shortly after Basira came to see me, I \ndecided not to request her help with the tunnels. It has become clear she has \nher own concerns to be dealing with, and I am becoming less and less \nconvinced that further police involvement won’t result in more issues down \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG074 – Fatigue \n9 \n \nthe road. So, shortly after she left, I decided to get somewhat more proactive \nand purchased a small motion-sensor camera, which I hid in view of the \ntrapdoor. After a week, I reviewed the footage. \nIt is remarkably poor quality, far below what the specifications of the setup \nshould yield. It may be I was unfair to Elias about his difficulties setting up \nCCTV in the Archives. Nonetheless, I was able to make out enough. For a start, I \nsaw Sasha, on two separate occasions, entering and leaving the tunnels. \nI assume she must have gotten a copy of the key from somewhere, but it \nseems that when I met her down there earlier she probably wasn’t simply \nfollowing me out of concern. It’s not enough to confront her with yet; if she’s \nworking against us I don’t want to tip my hand too early, but I’ll keep a closer \neye on her. There’s definitely something she’s hiding. It may even be she \nknows the other individual I saw emerging from the trapdoor. \nAs I said, I do not recognise them. They appear to be a man, or at least male-\npresenting. Middle-aged or older judging from the frame, but hard to be sure. \nThey emerge around three in the morning, holding what appears to be an \nattaché case. Then, they spend about half an hour rifling through archives, and \nretreat back down after stuffing a handful of files into the case. On the one \nhand, this does reassure me that whatever’s down there is human, but what \nworries me is the manner they leave the trapdoor. Rather than picking the lock \nor forcing their way through, they seem to move the floor itself out of their \nway somehow, and replace it when they return. I’ve triple checked, and the \narea surrounding the trapdoor is completely solid. Human or not, that worries \nme. I will leave the camera set up for now and, hopefully, gather some further \ninformation, maybe get a clearer picture of their face. Whatever this individual \nmay be, I do not want to confront them unprepared. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG074 – Fatigue \n10 \n \nEnd supplemental \n[The Magnus Archives Theme - Outro] \nThe Magnus Archives is a podcast distributed by Rusty Quill and licensed under \na creative commons attribution, non-commercial share alike 4.0 international \nlicense.
