My hands were so \nslick with sweat that I fumbled several times with the handle before finally \npushing it open bodily, and falling through onto the floor of the Archives. It \nwas about three in the morning by that time. I had managed to reopen a few \nof my partially healed wounds, so I headed home to rest. \nIt turned out the trip had taken far more out of me than I thought; it was \nalmost a week before I felt like I might be up for another excursion. This time, \nhowever, I decided that I was not going to take any chances: I packed three \ntorches, with enough replacement batteries to last for days, food and water in \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG041 – Too Deep \n7 \n \ncase I was down there longer than expected, a box of white chalk to clearly \nmark my way, and the largest knife I was able to buy at short notice. The first \ntime down there I had, on more than one occasion, been almost certain that I \ncould hear sounds of movement from further into the tunnels. At the time I \nhad convinced myself it was simply a combination of echo and my mind playing \non my fears, but on the chance there was something down there... Well, I had \nmy doubts how effective a knife would be, but it certainly eased my mind. \nBeyond that, I made sure to take one of the smaller CO2 fire extinguishers \nfrom the Archives. I was determined that any surviving worms would not be so \nfor long. \nAgain, I waited until nightfall before letting myself into the Archives, and \nheading down into the tunnels below. Almost as soon as I got down there I \nstarted marking the walls and intersections with white, chalk arrows. They \npointed the direction I had come from, the direction I’d need to follow when I \nwanted to leave. If there was anything down here and I had to flee, then I \nreasoned all I would need to do was follow the chalk arrows back to the \nentrance. \nFor a while this worked. Once or twice I discovered I had inadvertently made a \nloop or gotten turned around and was facing one of my earlier arrows, but it \nwas a relatively simple matter to correct it. I also set up my watch so I had a \nclear idea of how long I had been down there. After a half hour I had gotten far \ndeeper than I had in my entire first expedition, and gotten past the empty \narea, into the tunnels still lined with dead worms, and then beyond them, to \nthose tunnels wholly empty and, apparently, undisturbed since the days of \nMillbank Prison. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG041 – Too Deep \n8 \n \nI had done what research I could on Millbank. First proposed and designed in \n1799 by Jeremy Bentham, a philosopher who wished to test his theories of the \npanopticon prison, where cells would be arranged in a circle around a single, \ncentral, guard tower, so all cells were observable at once. It was to have six \nsuch areas, arranged in hexagons, giving it from the air the shape of a vast, \nangular flower. \nIt’s not clear why that original plan was abandoned, but from 1812 onwards, a \nsuccession of other architects were brought in to try and finish the project. \nFinally, three years later, they brought in Robert Smirke. He saw the project to \ncompletion in 1821, with a design remarkably similar to Bentham’s original. \nHowever, whereas Bentham’s would have been geometric, and easy to \nnavigate, Millbank Penitentiary as it was built was more often described as an \neccentric maze: twisting corridors, doors at strange angles, and narrow \npassages so poorly lit inmates would need to feel their way along. Throughout \nmuch of the 19th century it was where prisoners were kept before \ntransportation to Australia, and the brutality of the jailors was said to be \nsecond to none. Its position on what was then marshlands hardly helped, with \nsickness and disease rife within their walls. \nIt was a huge complex, covering much of what we now call Chelsea, but when \nit was finally closed in 1890, it was demolished. Flattened. Which meant that \nwhat I was in now couldn’t be the old prison itself. It had to be something built \nbelow it. And it was this that gave me such pause when I found the first set of \nsteps leading even further down. \nThey were stone, spiralling into the darkness at an angle so steep it made my \nlegs weaken slightly.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 4, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 4289}}
