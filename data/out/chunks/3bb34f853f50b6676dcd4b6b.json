She \nruns to the door to their room but as she approaches she can feel the heat \nalready wafting out from behind it. She can hear them crying out in agony, \nbegging for her to save them as their pain crescendos. \nShe can smell the oily reek of charred skin as they call to her: ‘We're burning! \nWe're burning! Oh please, god, Sabina; we're burning!’ \nShe grabs the handle, ignoring the sizzling of her own flesh and pushing \nthrough the lancing needles of torment to force it down, trying to free her \nunseen parents. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 169 – Fire Escape \n16 \n[Sizzle of flesh; fire sound is building intensity] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nBut the door latch never really aligned properly, you see. The landlord always \nsaid he was going to get it fixed, and it refuses to open. Sabina pounds \nhelplessly on the smoking wood as the voices of her parents go quiet. Pushing \ndown a grief that threatens to overwhelm her senses, she charges to the \nwindow, rushing to reach the old fire escape beyond. The window frame never \nreally opened properly, you see. The landlord always said he was going to get it \nfixed. And it judders as she tries to force it open, freezing a few inches from \nthe bottom. \nSabina pushes all her might into it but the glass cracks and shatters, peppering \nher with razor-sharp shards, cutting her face to ribbons. She stumbles, trying to \nclimb through the jagged window regardless, and she can feel the cool iron of \nthe fire escape, a moment of blessed relief that shines through her suffering. \nBut the fire escape was always really rusty, you see. The landlord always said \nhe was going to replace it. And at the first tiny bit of weight she puts upon it, \nshe can feel the fastenings pop out of the old brick one by one, and her \nsalvation tumbles away into the impossible distance below. \n[Collapse sound] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nWhat floor was her flat on again? Surely it can't be this high. \nFalling back into the inferno that is now her home, Sabina dashes over to the \nlaughably small fire extinguisher the landlord begrudgingly provided. It is \nsputtering and empty. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 169 – Fire Escape \n17 \nShe runs to the sink, to the tap that has always made that unpleasant grinding \nsound, and turning it, unleashes only a slow trickle of a thick, dark, oozing \nsubstance that smells faintly of gas. \n[Collapse sound; distant screams] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nLimping and desperate, she turns to see her furniture in flames, the \nbookshelves full of memories that she can't quite place but knows are precious \nto her curl and float away as ash. \n[Hissing static starts] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nThe photos on the wall of her family— \nMARTIN \n(Faintly in the background) (shouting) John! \nARCHIVIST \n(Continuing) —whose faces seem indistinct but she knows that— \nMARTIN \n(Background) John! \nARCHIVIST \n(Continuing) —she loves, begin to blacken as the glass— \nMARTIN \n(Background) John! \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 169 – Fire Escape \n18 \n(Martin coughs) \nARCHIVIST \n(Continuing) —pops out of the frame. Her home is being eaten alive by— \nMARTIN \n(Getting louder) John, she’s here! You need to come back! \nARCHIVIST \n(Continuing) —this devouring Desolation, and she— \nMARTIN \n(Loud) John! \n[He slaps the Archivist] \n[Inferno sounds change from muffled to crisp as the Archivist is \nslapped out of the statement; the fire is all around, parts of the \nbuilding regularly collapse, and people scream] \nMARTIN (CONT’D) \nShe's here! \n(Martin coughs) \n[Hissing static ends] \n[A thunder-like crack as nearby part of the building collapses] \nARCHIVIST \nHello, Jude. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 169 – Fire Escape \n19 \nJUDE PERRY \n(Sarcastic) Fancy seeing you both here. \nTo what, exactly, do I owe the pleasure — the honour — of being graced by \nthe great and powerful Archivist, harbinger of this new world and his, mm… \n...valet? \nARCHIVIST \nActually, we came to see you. \n(Jude inhales) \nJUDE \nWhat a treat. \n(In the background, Martin coughs wheezily) \nARCHIVIST \nI have a question for you. I've been wondering: did you know what you were \ndoing? \nJUDE \nExcuse me? \nARCHIVIST \nWhen you burned me. Marked me with… Did you know it would lead to, all of \nthis? \nJUDE \n(Unimpressed) You came all this way just to ask that?", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 4, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 4434}}
