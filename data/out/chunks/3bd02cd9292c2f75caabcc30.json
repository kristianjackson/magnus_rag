Can you do anything? \nDAISY \nBasira… \nARCHIVIST \nI’m sorry. I told you. She’s too… too deep. I can’t do anything, not without \nkilling her. \nBASIRA \n(Pleadingly) Daisy. It’s me. Come on, please... \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 179 – Accomplice \n \n21 \nDAISY \nPartner. C-Come. \nBASIRA \n(Beat) \n[Hissing static starts] \nOh. I see. \nMARTIN \nWhat? \nBASIRA \nShe... she wants me to join her. In the Hunt. \nMARTIN \nWhat? Could… Is that even possible? \nBASIRA \nYes. \nI can feel it. In the blood. \nARCHIVIST \n(Weakly) Basira… \n[Basira takes three more steps] \nBASIRA \nI can’t leave her like this. She’s always had my back. Always. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 179 – Accomplice \n \n22 \nMARTIN \nBasira don’t, please... \nDAISY \nPartner... Come... \n[More footsteps] \nBASIRA \nNot now. Not after everything. \nDAISY \n(Impatient) Basira! Now! \nBASIRA \nI… can’t. \nDAISY \nBasir— \n[Gunshot] \n(Daisy snarls) \n[Two rapid gunshots] \n[Daisy collapses into the rubble, dead] \n[Hissing static ends] \n[The distant rumble of machinery and furnaces continues] \n(Breathing; there is nothing to say for a while) \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 179 – Accomplice \n \n23 \nMARTIN \nBasira, I— \nBASIRA \nShut up. \n(Beat) \nMARTIN \nI’m sorry. I know— \nBASIRA \n(Dangerously) Shut. Up. \n[Basira starts walking away] \nMARTIN \nNo, Basira, wait! J-John’s leg… Basira! \nARCHIVIST \n(Emphatically) Let her go. \n(Beat) \nIs it... Is it awful that I wish she’d recognised me? \nMARTIN \nDaisy? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 179 – Accomplice \n \n24 \nARCHIVIST \nYeah. I mean, she was... We were friends there, sort of, near the end. We went \nthrough so much and it just... I wish I could have actually said goodbye. \nMARTIN \nWould it have made you feel any better about any of it? \nARCHIVIST \nI don’t know. Maybe? It’s hard to know how I feel about anything these days. \n(Beat) \nMARTIN \nWe said our goodbyes to Daisy after the Institute. This was just… This was just \ndealing with all the stuff she left behind. \nARCHIVIST \n…I suppose. \n(Beat) \n[Martin unzips a backpack and begins patching up the Archivist] \nMARTIN \nCome on, I need to patch that leg up properly. The last thing we need is a limp \nslowing us down. \n(The Archivist winces) \nOf course, that’s assuming the bandages haven’t transformed into snakes or \nsomething. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 179 – Accomplice \n \n25 \nARCHIVIST \nHmm? No, they’re, they’re fine. \nMARTIN \nI’d forgotten we had them to be honest. I packed them before I realised what a \ncelebrity you were out here. I was starting to think I’d never need them. I’m \nsurprised she could hurt you at all. \nARCHIVIST \nYes, that came as a bit of a shock to me as well, actually. \nMARTIN \nYou didn’t know? \nARCHIVIST \nI didn’t think to check. Just, sort of, assumed it was safe. \nMARTIN \nThat’s a pretty big assumption, John. \nARCHIVIST \nHmmm. Apparently. I mean I know it sounds strange but it... it felt right for \nDaisy to be able to hurt me. \nMARTIN \nDream logic again? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 179 – Accomplice \n \n26 \nARCHIVIST \nMmm. The… resonances from our relationship before the change carried over \nand— \n(Pained sounds from the Archivist) \nMARTIN \nHold still. \n[Returning footsteps] \nMARTIN (CONT’D) \nHow’re you doing? \nBASIRA \n(Weary) How do you think? \nMARTIN \nSure. \nBASIRA \nI’m… going to stay here. Burn the body. \nARCHIVIST \nOf course. We can wait. I still need to, uh… \nBASIRA \nNo. You go on. I’ll make my own way to London. \n[The backpack is zipped up again] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 179 – Accomplice \n \n27 \nMARTIN \nWhat? No, don’t be daft, it’s not a problem for us to wait while you deal with \nthis. \nBASIRA \nPlease. Just go. \n(Beat) \nMARTIN \nWait, seriously? \nARCHIVIST \nBasira, if you travel on your own, if you’re not with us... I can’t guarantee your \nsafety. \nBASIRA \nGood. \nMARTIN \nBasira, getting yourself hurt isn’t going to help anyone. \nBASIRA \nIt’s just... something I have to do. \nYou said follow the tower, right? \nARCHIVIST \nRight.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 4, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 4004}}
