My main hobby really – all the \nequipment can get quite costly after a while and I don’t earn enough to have \nmore than one expensive activity like that in my life. Alena, my sister, came \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG015 – Lost John’s Cave \n2 \n \nalong with me on a trip a few years back. She'd lost her job and her house in \nquick succession and was staying with me. I thought it would cheer her up. It \ndid, and we've been doing it ever since. Stupid idea, really. I wish I'd left her \ncrying on the sofa. At least then she'd still be alive. \nWe didn’t really have the money to actually go potholing all that often, so I \nspent a lot of time reading and planning and just looking at stuff online. We \naveraged maybe a cave a year. Alena was never quite as into it as I was, \nthough. Don’t get me wrong, she was no claustrophobe and I wasn’t forcing \nher to follow me into the darkness on threat of a family rift, but she mainly \nenjoyed the climbing, and I always ended up going a little bit deeper than she \nwanted. I think to be honest she would have preferred to get her exercise \nunder the open sky or, failing that, in an above-ground gym. Maybe we should \nhave tried cliffs or a climbing wall but caving was our thing. It had helped her \nwhen she was in a bad place, and she knew how much I loved it. She also \nwasn’t too keen on the scrapes and bruises you always get on expeditions. She \nused to joke that it felt like the earth itself was trying to kick her ass. If only she \nhad known. We did have fun, though, and she always chose to come along. I \nnever forced her to be there. I never did that. \nWe'd done some of the Three Counties cave system before – a short trip of \nonly a couple of hours into the Rift Pot caves. The whole system is huge, \nthough, I mean there's a reason it's called the Three Counties System, so there \nwas plenty more to explore and we'd had so much fun the first time that I \nwanted to try it from a different angle. We were going to go in through the \nDeath's Head Hole, then travelling through Lost John's Cave as far as Gavel Pot \nbefore heading back. The prospect of this excited me, as in order to travel \nbetween Lost John's Cave and the Gavel Pot system we were going to have to", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 0, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 3121}}
