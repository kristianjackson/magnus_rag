I tried to get away, but he was faster, and \nslammed into me, pushing off my feet and into the rusted fence behind me. \nThere was an explosion of pain in my back, as jagged metal embedded itself in \nmy shoulder, and then it went dark. The last thing I remember before the \nhospital was the fierce pride on Calvin’s face as he stood there. \nNo-one believed me about what happened. Calvin said that I had tripped and \nfallen, and that was the story everyone accepted, but after that he was \ndifferent. Moody. He started getting into fights. Everyone just assumed he was \nturning into a teenager, but six children at my school were seriously injured or \nkilled by the time he left for university. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG082 – The Eyewitnesses \n17 \n \nAll accidents, of course, nothing that would have pointed to him. But I was \nalways careful around him, the daisy-scar on my back a constant reminder that \nwe were not friends, that he was no longer to be trusted. I told people, but he \nseemed to feed on the uneasy glances of his classmates, and took great \npleasure in scaring them further. \nEven after school, I kept an eye on him but I couldn’t believe he had never \nbeen arrested. I later got a look at his file and found out that he had been, but \nthey’d never been able to make anything stick. He was smart and careful. We \nonce almost nailed him for aggravated assault, but the victims changed their \nstory and said they were the ones who attacked him. \nDAISY \nYou’ve made your point. \nELIAS (STATEMENT) \nSix years ago, Calvin Benchley became the first human being I murdered. I beat \nhim round the head as he was coming out of a bar, drove him to my usual spot \nand shot him five times in the chest with a handgun taken from the evidence \nlock-up. He didn’t beg for his life. He didn’t say a word. I don’t think he even \nrecognised me. He was harder to get rid of than the vampires, but I managed \nit. \nAnd nobody asked any questions at all. He was a scumbag, and nobody wants \nto risk getting a Section 31. He was the first human I dealt with like that, but he \ncertainly wasn’t the last. \nELIAS \nDo I need to go on, Detective Tonner? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG082 – The Eyewitnesses \n18 \n \n(Pause) Good. Feel free to see yourself out. If you take any action against \nmyself or this Institute, I will ensure the police become aware of your crimes in \na way that cannot be ignored or covered up. \nI leave the matter of Jonathan Sims up to you, though I will not tell you where \nhe is. I suggest you close the case and move on, but if you find yourself unable \nto do so, my advice is to kill him quickly. There’s no telling what he might be \ncapable of. \n[A chair is moved and the door opens.] \nDAISY \nOne day, someone is going to kill you. I really hope it’s me. \n[The door is slammed behind Daisy as she leaves.] \nELIAS \nGood day, Detective. \n[Tape clicks off. Tape clicks on.] \nMARTIN \n– but she looked like she’d seen a, well, you know… \nTIM \nSo? \nMARTIN \nSo, I’m just saying, she spends all that time in there with Elias, and then leaves \nlike that? Maybe he told her something. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG082 – The Eyewitnesses \n19 \n \nTIM \nOr maybe she just hates it here. Like a normal person. \nMARTIN \nMaybe they said something about Sasha, y’know? \nTIM \nShe’s dead, Martin. Come on! Even you’re not that blind. He got her, too. \nMARTIN \nDon’t you say that. Don’t you dare say that! \nTIM \nI didn’t. It was that detective. Y-You try talking to her about it? \nMARTIN \nShe didn’t care. Just wanted to know where he was. \nTIM \nMakes sense. \nMARTIN \nNo. No it doesn’t! Nothing about this makes sense! \nI don’t know who that old man was, but John would never hurt Sasha. \nTIM \nFine. If it wasn’t him, it must have been that thing we saw. \nMARTIN", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 4, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 3763}}
