Original \nstatement given April 22nd 2009. Audio recording by Jonathan Sims, Head \nArchivist of the Magnus Institute, London. \nStatement begins. \nARCHIVIST (STATEMENT) \nI don’t know this place. They said I should come and talk to you. A few people \ndid. People I thought I knew, but they were different. I should know this place, \nI think. I used to go to the Tate a lot when I lived in London, and I, I passed the \nbuilding, but... I don’t know you people. Nothing makes sense anymore. \nIt was meant to be just a quick job. Since the divorce I’ve been back working as \na cleaner, and for the last month or so John Hector Lettings in Oxford have \nbeen bringing me in to get student houses ready for next year’s occupants. It’s \nnot always pleasant work. After all, students are not exactly careful tenants; \nI’ve had to spend more than one afternoon scraping and repainting bedroom \n\nwalls for some soon-to-be-dropout that turned the room into a hotbox. But it \npays the bills. Barely. \nI guess this is why I was so keen when I got the call about Hill Top Road. A nice, \nsimple job. No pulling out instant noodles from behind the oven. No post-grad \nparty gunk to find behind the sofa. Just a newly built house that needed a good \nclean once the builders were finished. Hoover up some plaster dust, wipe \ndown the counters, a bit of polish on the metal fittings… easy. If there were \nalready beds in there, maybe I’d grab a quick nap, make up for all the unpaid \novertime I’d had to put in steam cleaning the last house where some of them \nhad made active use of the bedroom. All told I thought it was the break I’d \nearned, and not a moment too soon. \nIt was raining when I pulled into the house. Not heavy, but the sky was that \nsoggy grey that lets you know the weather isn’t changing anytime soon. As a \nrule I don’t mind the rain too much, but there was nothing relaxing about this \nweather. No regular thump of droplets tapping on bin lids or windscreens; you \njust ended up damp and grumpy. I’ve been thinking back, trying to remember \nif I got any kind of… sense about that house. Whether the windows were \ndarker than they should have been, or if the frame of the place was… heavier. I \ndon’t know. Hard to tell, I was too busy trying to manoeuvre the keys without \nhaving to put my bag down on the waterlogged path. It wasn’t until I actually \ngot through the door that anything seemed to be at all wrong. \nEven then it was only small things. Easy to ignore. I’m not superstitious, never \nused to be at least, so how dim the lights were made me think the owners \nwere cheap; maybe they’d decided to go all-in on those weak energy-saving \nbulbs. The cold?
