Most days it was completely \ndeserted, and even in those summer holidays where the number of sunbathers \nwas so high no part of the beach could fully escape them, it would only have a \nhandful of dedicated loungers lying around, quietly reading and studiously \nignoring their own unease. Exactly why it remained like that and no-one \nseemed to notice is a mystery to me even now, but whatever the cause, it was \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 147 – Weaver \n \n14 \n \na shunned place. And sitting on the side of the road above it, casting a thick, \nangular shadow, was the squat, brick structure of the old chip shop. \nI’d never seen it open. No-one had, as far as I could tell. It was painted a dark \nblue that never quite matched any colour of sky that was behind it, and had a \nhand-lettered sign that could still be seen covering much of the bare left-hand \nwall in curling, faded typeface: ‘Chips’. The old chip shop had been there as \nlong as I’d been alive, probably much longer, and its silent one-storey \nsilhouette had always unsettled me. It was only looking back that I realised \nhow few windows it had, just one tiny panel of glass either side of the big \ndoors. The rest of the structure was just plain, unadorned brickwork. I don’t \nreally know why I decided to hide there, but assuming you’ve been paying \nattention, then I’m sure by now you understand how little that means. \nPerhaps, deep down, I simply knew it would be unlocked. \nThe sun was setting by the time I reached it, and if there had been any tourists \ntrying to enjoy the beach in that place, they were long since gone. I was utterly \nalone, the only sound a few distant seagulls screaming to be fed as they circled \naimlessly looking for food. Against the vivid, red-orange of the sky the old chip \nshop seemed almost black, like a fallen obelisk. A light rain began to patter \ndown and I, not having had the foresight to pack an umbrella, ran to it and \nopened the door as quickly and as quietly as I could. Inside, it was warm and \ndry. Dust coated everything and I struggled more than once not to sneeze, \nsomething I was convinced would somehow alert my family to where I was. So, \nI crawled under one of the counters, and soon enough sleep had come for me. \nI awoke to the sound of rhythmic clattering, the noise of wood striking wood in \na complex, intricate pattern. I got up, more curious than fearful at that \nmoment, and took a few tentative steps towards it. The sound seemed to be", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 4, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 2781}}
