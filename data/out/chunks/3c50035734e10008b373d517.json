Plenty of money, to be \nsure, but for the services he was offering, and the dangers involved, it was \npractically nothing. \nUnfortunately, for all my consternation, it soon became clear that Benjamin \nhad made up his mind to hire the man. To be fair to him, we did not have the \nresources to winter in Fort John and were we to try and make our way back, \nthere was every possibility the weather would still turn deadly on us. We were \ncaught between the devil and the sea and Benjamin had determined that, \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 058 – Trail Rations \n \n8 \n \nguided by Eustace Wick, we were going to try and swim. The poor fool had no \nidea that the devil was the one leading us into the water. \nNobody tried to stop us leaving, though it was clear from the looks upon them \nthat they believed us to be dead already. My own hopes for us were scarce \nhigher, but the little man who now rode with us cackled and joked as we \ntravelled, keeping Benjamin in higher spirits than I had seen him in months. \nThis began to fade as the cold air began to hit us and the paths through the \nRockies became steeper and narrower. \nThe journey was hard, but we pushed on for almost a week. Eustace Wick \nseemed to be as good as his word, keeping us on those trails that the wagon \ncould use without too much danger. The cold robbed us of sleep though and \nafter those first days, the once beautiful vistas and rolling peaks of the \nmountains seemed to become jagged and vile – ribs jutting from the carcass of \nthe world and picked clean by vultures. Benjamin became quiet. I became \nsullen. Eustace Wick became more aggravatingly jovial than before and, by the \ntime the first snowflakes began to fall, he was practically hooting with joy. My \nsuspicions about his motives had begun to freeze into an icicle within my chest \n– hard and focused. When we woke up one morning, a week and a half into \nthe journey, to find one of our wagon’s wheels smashed and destroyed beyond \nrepair, I could not find it in myself to be surprised. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 058 – Trail Rations \n \n9 \n \nThe snow was falling thickly by this point and we had already used all our \nreplacement wheels over the many months of the journey. We were trapped \nthere and would surely die. It was then that Eustace Wick appeared, standing \non a nearby rock, that same big grin on his face. He told us that there looked to \nbe a snowstorm coming, but he had found a nearby cave where we could wait \nit out. He didn’t even pretend to dismay at the state of the wagon. Benjamin \nand I followed him and, sure enough, there in the side of the mountain was a \nshallow, but well-hidden cave. \nIt’s hard to say at exactly what point I realised specifically that Eustace Wick \nwas planning to eat us. It may have been that he made no mention of \nretrieving any food from the wagon when he led us to his den. It could have \nbeen the piles of firewood already neatly stacked up against the far wall, cut \ninto logs. It might just have been the way he looked at Benjamin, with his \nsquare white teeth bared in a mirthless smile. But somewhere between the \nwagon and the cave, I became convinced that our so-called guide had lured us \nup here with no intention short of killing us and eating our flesh. \nI had no time to communicate this thought to my husband, however, who still \nseemed woefully oblivious of the situation, and once we were inside the small \ncave, there was no privacy in which to discuss it. So, I just had to sit there, \nwatching Eustace Wick building a fire, as Benjamin tried to suppress his shivers", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 3, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 3772}}
