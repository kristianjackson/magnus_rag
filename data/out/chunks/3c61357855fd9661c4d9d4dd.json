At first I thought it was nerves or even a panic attack at finding \nmyself alone, but it was the heat; this warmth that seemed to start in my \nbones and radiate out through me. I took off my hat and jacket, but I just got \nhotter and hotter until it felt like I was cooking from the inside. I tried to \nscream but I couldn’t find my breath, I couldn’t move. I was burning up. \nThere was a knock at the door and the feeling abruptly vanished. I was cold \nagain, lying on the bare floor. I struggled to my feet as the knock came again. \nMy hand shook as I opened it. By now I didn’t know what to expect. Would it \nbe Raymond again? Agnes? Or some other thing to announce the end of my \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG008 – Burned Out \n10 \n \nsanity. What I did not expect was a Catholic priest. He was short, and a bit \nportly, with close cropped hair and deep smile lines around his mouth. He \nintroduced himself as Father Edwin Burroughs and told me that “Annie” had \nasked him to pay the place a visit. I didn’t know any Annie and told him so, and \nhe seemed slightly confused, said she worked as a nurse at the John Radcliffe \nHospital. This allayed my fears enough that I let him in, and I asked him if he \nwas some sort of exorcist. Father Burroughs smiled and told me yes, that’s \nexactly what he was. \nSo I told him my story as he went around examining the house. He nodded as I \nwent through what happened, occasionally asking a question about what had \nbeen said or how I had felt. Finally he seemed satisfied and said he’d do what \nhe could. He explained that exorcism was really only for demons and it wasn’t \nsomething he could do to ghosts, at least not officially – whether or not ghosts \nactually existed was apparently just as divisive a question within the church as \noutside of it – but he would go through some blessings and see if he could \nhelp. He asked me to wait outside while he worked, so I headed into the back \ngarden and waited. \nAs I stood there in the cold, my eyes fell on the tree. That creepy, damn tree. I \ndon’t know why, but at that moment I felt an intense, maddening anger at that \ntree. I picked up a crowbar that lay on a nearby pile of wood and, drawing my \narm back, I swung it at the trunk, burying it with all my might. I felt something \nwarm and wet spray out where I had hit it. Sap? No, it didn’t feel like sap. I \nturned on my torch to see blood flowing from the wounded tree. It ran down \nthe crowbar and dripped onto the earth, running in rivulets. As it reached the \nroots I saw something else in my torch’s light, curling up from the base of the \ntree were old, black scorch marks. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG008 – Burned Out \n11 \n \nAt that moment I made my decision. It was easy, like destroying this tree was \nthe only thing to do, the only path to follow. I found a long chain among the \nbuilding materials in the garden and wrapped it around the still-bleeding trunk, \nthen attached the ends to my car. It took me less than a minute to pull it down, \nand there was no more blood. When the tree lay on its side, uprooted and \npowerless, I gazed into the hole where it had sat and noticed something lying \nthere in the dirt. \nClimbing down, I retrieved what turned out to be a small wooden box, about \nsix inches square, with an intricate pattern carved along the outside. Engraved \nlines covered it, warping and weaving together, making it hard to look away. I \nopened the box and sitting inside was a single green apple. It looked fresh, \nshiny, with a coat of condensation like it had just been picked on a cool spring \nmorning. I picked it up. I wasn’t going to eat it, I’m not that stupid, but more \nthan bleeding trees or phantom burning, this confused me. As I took it out of \nthe box, though, it began to turn. The skin turned brown and bruised and \nstarted to shrivel in my hand. Then it split. And out came spiders. Dozens, \nhundreds of spiders erupting from this apple that was rotting right before my \neyes. I shrieked and dropped it before any of them could touch my arm. The \napple fell to the ground and burst in a cloud of dust. I backed away and waited \nuntil I was sure all the spiders had left before retrieving the box. I smashed it \nwith a crowbar and threw the remains into a skip. \nFather Burroughs returned shortly afterwards. He told me he’d done his \nprayers and hoped that it would be some help. If he noticed the felled tree, he \ndidn’t ask any questions about it, instead he just handed me his business car", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 6, "chunk_count": 9, "chars": 4499}}
