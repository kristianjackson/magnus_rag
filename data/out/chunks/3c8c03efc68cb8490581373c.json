Episode sixty-one. Hard Shoulder. \n[The Magnus Archives Theme – Intro Continued.] \n[Tape clicks on.] \nARCHIVIST \nYou don’t mind if I record this, do you? \nDAISY \nKnock yourself out. \nARCHIVIST \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 061 – Hard Shoulder \n \n2 \n \nRight. \nDAISY \nCourse, if anyone else ever hears it... \nARCHIVIST \nYou’ll arrest me. \nDAISY \nNo. \nARCHIVIST \nR-right... um, so you came to deliver one of the tapes? \n(Daisy doesn’t reply.) \nARCHIVIST \nFrom Basira? \n(Daisy doesn’t reply.) \nARCHIVIST \nThe, uh, the audio tapes. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 061 – Hard Shoulder \n \n3 \n \n(Daisy doesn’t reply.) \nARCHIVIST \nSo... can I have it? Please? \nDAISY \nI’m thinking. \nARCHIVIST \nUm, right, I thought you needed me to check them? \nDAISY \nYou don’t get it, do you? \nARCHIVIST \nI’m not sure I follow. \nDAISY \nThe tapes. Why she was giving them to you. \nARCHIVIST \nShe, uh... she wanted my help. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 061 – Hard Shoulder \n \n4 \n \n(Daisy laughs.) \nARCHIVIST \nYou, you didn’t have a tape player at your station. \nDAISY \nShe thought you did it. \nARCHIVIST \nWhat? \nDAISY \nWe both did. \nARCHIVIST \nWait, you thought I killed Gertrude? \nDAISY \nYes. \nARCHIVIST \nW-Why? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 061 – Hard Shoulder \n \n5 \n \nDAISY \n(Sigh) Look at you. You’re obsessed with it, jumpy as hell and you’re the only \nperson who benefited from her death. \nARCHIVIST \nI, I mean. I didn’t. \nDAISY \nYeah, I know. \n(Sigh) Finally got IT to clean up the CCTV for the week she disappeared. No \ncameras in the Archive, but we got plenty of footage of you. Watched your \nmovements that whole week. You didn’t kill her. \nARCHIVIST \nI don’t... what does this have to do with the tapes? \nDAISY \nDidn’t have enough to hold you. Basira was worried you were going to run. \nARCHIVIST \nW- so, what, you fed me a couple of tapes to keep me around? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 061 – Hard Shoulder \n \n6 \n \nDAISY \nYeah. \nARCHIVIST \nAnd now you know I am innocent...? \nDAISY \nHm. I reckon we should cut you off. But Basira’s soft. She likes you. No idea \nwhy. Maybe she keeps feeding you tapes – doesn’t involve me. I don’t plan on \nseeing or hearing anything about it. \nARCHIVIST \nUm, well, thank you, Detective Tonner. \nDAISY \nDaisy. \nARCHIVIST \nThank you, Daisy. \nDAISY \nSure. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 061 – Hard Shoulder \n \n7 \n \nARCHIVIST \nIf you don’t mind me asking, how long have you been sectioned now? \nDAISY \nI do mind. Fourteen years. \nARCHIVIST \nI don’t suppose you’d like to make a statement? \nDAISY \nAbout what? \nARCHIVIST \nWhatever you like. Fourteen years – you must have seen any number of \nparanormal things. \nDAISY \nAnd you want me to tell you about them. \nARCHIVIST \nI, I... \n(Pause.) \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 061 – Hard Shoulder \n \n8 \n \nDAISY \nOkay. \nARCHIVIST \nWhat? \nDAISY \nOkay. I’ll give you a statement, about how I got my Section 31. You look \nsurprised. \nARCHIVIST \nI mean, I was largely asking as a formality. Basira didn’t give the impression you \nwere the sharing sort. \nDAISY \nMaybe you caught me in a good mood. \nARCHIVIST \nRight, well, good. Do you need me to go over our non-disclosure policies? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 061 – Hard Shoulder \n \n9 \n \nDAISY \nNot as long you understand my policy. If it gets out, I’ll break every bone in \nyour body. \nARCHIVIST \n(Muttering) There are worse things that could happen to them. \nDAISY \nWhat? \nARCHIVIST \nNothing. Statement of Detective Alice ‘Daisy’ Tonner of the London \nMetropolitan Police. What’s the subject? \nDAISY \nTraffic stop of a delivery van on the M6 near Preston, afternoon of... 24th July \n2002. \nARCHIVIST \nRecorded live from subject, 1st December 2016. Statement begins. \nDAISY (STATEMENT)", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 0, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 4085}}
