So I decided I would keep up the ruse \nuntil the truck was empty, in the hopes I’d have a chance later. But as we \nunloaded the last of the grim cargo, and I carried a heavy, red tongue down \ninto the vault, I saw another truck pull up, almost identical to the first. Then \nanother. Then another. There was no end to them. \nDay turned into night, turned into day again, and still I carried meat and threw \nit into the hole. My back was screaming, my legs were weak, and my mind was \nnumb from terror, but I was spurred on by one thing. The woman with the \nbackwards arms had fallen sometime in the night, and her companions had \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 130 – Meat \n10 \n \nshowed no hesitation. They had gripped her shoulders, hoisted her up, and \nhurled her straight into the gaping maw. I swore it wouldn’t happen to me. \nAll through this, the mouth got closer and closer to the edge of the pit. The pile \nof flesh within it grew larger and larger, sat there in an awful, half-solid slurry. \nChewed and crushed together, it was impossible to tell what had once been \nanimal and what might once have been us. It was all just meat. And as the \nmouth got closer, the smell got stronger. The air became thick and the walls \nbegan to sweat a pinkish liquid, like cutting into a steak. More of those workers \nhad been thrown in, replaced by others brought in the endless procession of \nmeat trucks. I didn’t know what was going to happen when it finally reached \nthe top, but I knew it would be something bad. Something unspeakable. And I \nwould have helped make it happen. \nWhen the explosion came, it was a blessed relief. A deep rumble passed \nthrough the structure of the building, a deafening cry of rage and dismay that \ncame from below, as the roof collapsed downwards, burying it under a torrent \nof rubble and stone. I was lucky. At that moment, I had been stood in the \nbottom of the stairwell, and as the world collapsed around me, I began to \nsprint up the stairs, but I barely made it halfway up before that toppled as well, \nand I felt the foundations of the temple above fall down around me. I thought I \nwas dead. I wish I had been. \nI don’t know how long I lay trapped there before Turkish rescue workers found \nme, certainly long enough that the scent of rot began to waft up from far \nbelow. I was delirious, barely conscious. I tried to warn them, to tell them to \nfinish the job, but all that did was convince them there might be other \nsurvivors. They haven’t told me what they found down there. They paid for my \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 130 – Meat \n11 \n \nflight home, but they haven’t told me anything. I don’t know anything. I just \nwant to sleep. \nThat’s it. That’s all I have. That’s what happened. \nGERTRUDE \nAnd do you feel any better? \nLUCIA \nNo. \nGERTRUDE \nWell, that‘s a shame. Hang on, let me see if I can find you the number for that \ncounselling service. They’re actually quite good. \nLUCIA \nIf you say so. \n[Tape clicks off. Tape clicks on] \nGERTRUDE \nWell, that is a relief. When I heard there had been survivors of the Last Feast, I \nwas rather concerned that one of them might be able to positively identify me, \nwhich could land me in all sorts of trouble. But she doesn’t seem to remember \nme at all. Tom Haan might be a bit more of a problem, as it looks like he also \nsurvived, but I’m hopeful he has been weakened enough by this failure to not \nbe an issue in the near future. Hopefully he’ll fade away or burn out, as they \ntend to when robbed of their purpose. Still, I should keep a watch on him in", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 4, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 3617}}
