It’s faded now. He \nremembers aches and worries and, sometimes, something that might have \nbeen joy, but it’s far away now, like something seen projected on a distant \nwall. \nAnother step forward, and he’s standing at a desk. The person behind it – is \nthat a person? – wears a loose hood of coarse black leather. Below it they wear \na featureless mask of the same material without a gap for eyes or mouth or \neven the shape of a nose. They wordlessly slide a form across to Tyler. \n[Distorted grunts and sounds of paper sliding] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 178 – The Processing Line \n9 \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nHis eyes travel down it: name, age, ethnicity, blood type, eye colour, body \nmass index, the list stretches on and on and on, and he can feel the stares of \nthe thousands behind him burrowing into the back of his skull. He looks \naround, unable to find a pen, a pencil, anything. The thing sat behind the desk \ndoes not respond to his questions. \n[More distorted grunts and paper noises] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nFinally, Tyler takes his fingernail, now long and ragged from his time in the \nqueue, and painstakingly scores the words into the paper. When one nail \nbreaks, he uses another, until finally the information is carved into the thick \nwhite form. The thing behind the desk nods, just once, and points him to \nanother line, as long or longer than the first. Tyler feels his stomach drop as he \nwalks slowly over to join it. \nThis gradual procession of the doomed leads not to a desk, but to a small \nroom, partitioned off from the wider floor of the facility. What happens within \nit is not clear, but the looks of apprehension and despair on the faces around \nhim are even more pronounced than they were before. Once again Tyler \nconsiders briefly trying to run, but there’s nothing for it. Whatever the \nmanagement has prepared for him at the end is what’s coming for him. All he \ncan do is wait for the axe to drop. \nAnd wait he does, as the minutes turn into hours, turn into days, turn into \nyears, which mean nothing in the thick torpor of congealed time. Once or twice \nTyler tries to engage those in front or behind him in conversation, but gets only \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 178 – The Processing Line \n10 \npanicked weeping in response. He is silent; his only companion the heavy \ndread that is gradually expanding through his gut. \nAnother step and he is at the door to the small room. It is riveted iron, not \nrusty, but clean and polished to a sterile shine. The only smell is the smell of \ncleaning products. The door finally opens, and another thing stands there. \n[Grating metal door opening] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nIt is dressed like the one behind the desk, but stood to its full height it towers \nover Tyler in its leather apron. \n[Industrial noises now include an electric buzzing] \n[Distorted grunts] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nIt grips him firmly by the shoulder in hands with the weight and texture of \ngranite, and leads him into the room of clean and burnished metal. He tries not \nto stare at the implements that hang on the wall as he is placed on a wide \nmetal plate in the centre. He feels it yield slightly under his feet, and a weight \nappears on a screen set back into the wall. One of the things adjusting the \nequipment seems to become aware of this, though how it could have seen the \nmeasurement Tyler does not know, and it snatches the forms that he still \ncarries from his hand. \n[Distorted grunts and page-snatching]", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 2, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 3632}}
