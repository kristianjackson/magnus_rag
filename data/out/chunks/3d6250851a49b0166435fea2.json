Drink it. \nARCHIVIST \nI don’t really... Fine. \nBASIRA \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 140 – The Movement of the Heavens \n \n2 \n \nYou look awful. You try drinking with Daisy again last night? \nARCHIVIST \nShe was here last night, as you know. \nBASIRA \nDrinking alone, then? \nARCHIVIST \nIt’s not a hangover. \nWell, not... I wasn’t drinking. \nBASIRA \nDrugs then? You sick? Got some weird monster disease? \nARCHIVIST \nSeriously? \nBASIRA \nWe’ve been over this. You need to tell me stuff. Communication works both \nways, you know. \n(Heavy sigh from the Archivist.) \nARCHIVIST \nYesterday, I tried something and I— I, I deliberately tried to Know something. \nLike I did in the coffin, but there was a lot. Too much. And— \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 140 – The Movement of the Heavens \n \n3 \n \nBASRIA \nWhat did you find out? \nARCHIVIST \n(Scoffs) Nothing. There was too much. \nBASIRA \nYou don’t remember any of it? \nARCHIVIST \nYou drink the whole contents of a bar in three seconds, you don’t remember \nwhat the merlot tastes like. It just hurt. \nBASIRA \nSure. \n[Paper rustles] \nARCHIVIST \nWhat’s that? \nBASIRA \nStatement. You in a condition for it? \nARCHIVIST \nYes. Yes. What’s this one about? \nBASIRA \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 140 – The Movement of the Heavens \n \n4 \n \nTook me a while to hunt it down again, but you remember Maxwell Rayner? \nARCHIVIST \nYes, of course. Your warehouse showdown. \nBASIRA \nYeah, well, whole thing kind of stayed with me. \nARCHIVIST \nMmm, I can imagine. \nBASIRA \nWell there’s more history there than we thought. Capital ‘H’ history \nARCHIVIST \n“John Flamsteed”? Basira, this is from way before the Institute. \nBASIRA \nThe first Astronomer Royal. Had the post until his death in 1720. \nARCHIVIST \n1719. He died on New Year’s Eve. \nSorry, I didn’t— Can’t really help it. \nBASIRA \nWell, either way, he really hated the man who succeeded him. His former \nassistant, Edmond Halley. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 140 – The Movement of the Heavens \n \n5 \n \nARCHIVIST \nAs in Halley’s comet? \nBASIRA \nYep. And Flamsteed had a... What’s the opposite of a pet name? Like a \nnickname for someone you hate? \nARCHIVIST \nUh... \nBASIRA \nWell, he had one of them for Halley. Called him “Raymer”. \nARCHIVIST \n“Raymer”? A-And you think? \nBASIRA \nNames shift over the years, especially if you’re not keen on keeping the same \nbody. \nARCHIVIST \nRight. \nBASIRA \nJust… have a read. Let me know when you’re done. \nARCHIVIST \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 140 – The Movement of the Heavens \n \n6 \n \nYou’re not staying? \nBASIRA \nWatching you do your thing? No. \nARCHIVIST \nI... I suppose I understand. \n(The Archivist clears his throat.) \n[The door opens and closes.] \nARCHIVIST \nRight… \nStatement of John Flamsteed, taken from a partial unsent letter to Abraham \nSharp, 1715. Audio recording by Jonathan Sims, the Archivist. \nStatement begins. \nARCHIVIST (STATEMENT) \nUm… er… But my affliction in writing to you is of a wholly different character, \nand were I not well sure of your firm alliance and counsel I should under no \nextremity impose it upon you. For I have killed a man, and barely do I have the \ncovering of great passion for it, as I was well within my senses at the time. \nYou are familiar of course with my persecutor and tormentor Edmond Halley. \nThe one so oft descending upon me as Nemesis with her sword to avenge upon \nmy hubris.
