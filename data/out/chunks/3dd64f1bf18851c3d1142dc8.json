A cursory bit of research reveals the Fairchilds in question to be an \nexceptionally wealthy family based down in Cornwall. \nNo real business to speak of, but it appears they've invested very wisely in \naerospace technology, shipping logistics and underwater drilling and \nconstruction. Whatever their origin, I feel it's worth keeping an eye on them. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG051 – High Pressure \n10 \n \nEnd recording. \n \n[CLICK] \n[CLICK] \n \nSupplemental. \n \nI had a strange conversation with Sasha earlier today. I have been doing some \nresearch into her, but there's little to go on, save that she worked in artefact \nstorage. I decided to pay it a short visit to acquaint myself with any new \nacquisitions. Not much worth reporting really – a new oak wardrobe light is \napparently unable to penetrate, a carved rock eye they keep in a black velvet \nbag, apparently it interferes with the video cameras otherwise, and a rather \nnasty looking scalpel that is supposedly rife with disease, no matter what they \nuse to sterilise or disinfect it. That one's kept in a hermetically sealed plastic \nbox. \nI stumbled across Sasha staring at that damn table again. Luckily, I had the \nwherewithal to bring my tape recorder and managed to turn it on unnoticed. \nRecording follows. \n \n[CLICK] \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG051 – High Pressure \n11 \n \nIt's fascinating, isn't it? In the literal sense, I mean. \n \nNOT!SASHA \nYes, sometimes I can't pull myself away from it. \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nGiven recent events, I… I've been trying to figure out if it's a fractal. \n \nNOT!SASHA \nNo. No, it isn't. I've always seen it more… like a web. \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nI guess it has caught us, in its own way. \n \nNOT!SASHA \nI don't think we're the first to be caught. \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nNo? \n \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG051 – High Pressure \n12 \n \nNOT!SASHA \nI believe it caught Graham as well. \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nI thought that was… I… whatever crawled through his window. Unless you \nthink they're linked, somehow? \n \nNOT!SASHA \nI doubt it. It didn't sound like the sort of thing that would want to be bound to \nan object. \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nI suppose. And we haven't seen any long-limbed stalkers, so let's concentrate \non the table. \n \nNOT!SASHA \nAgreed. If you'll excuse me. \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nOf course. \n \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG051 – High Pressure \n13 \n \n[CLICK] \nOdd, but not alarming, though I think I may discuss restricting her access to the \ntable with Elias. Oh, and I've found out where she's been going when she takes \nextra-long lunch breaks. It seems harmless enough, but I admit I'm a bit \nbaffled. Every few days, she travels up to Baker Street to spend anywhere from \n10 minutes to a full hour in Madam Tussaud's wax museum. \nEnd supplement. \n \n[CLICK] \n[The Magnus Archives Theme - Outro] \n \nThe Magnus Archives is a podcast distributed by Rusty Quill and licensed under \na creative commons attribution, non-commercial share alike 4.0 international \nlicense.
