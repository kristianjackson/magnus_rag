I could feel the back of her jacket down there, though, and I \nmade a grab for it. \n \nNow, I’m not as strong as I was, maybe, but I held on and pulled. Wasn’t \nenough to get her out, something in there didn’t want to let her go, but I got \nher high enough that her arm broke the surface. She flailed a second, but got \nhold of the doorframe and started to pull herself out. Took her a while, but she \nwere almost there when I heard something moving behind us. Turned around \nto see Darvish stood there, and he did not look happy. I were already holding \nthe knife. I could smell him so thick it tasted like rancid treacle, and whatever \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG109 – Nightfall \n \n17 \n \nhe were shouting was quieter than the blood in my ears. It was going to be \ngood. \n \nI got him once across the chest, through his shirt, but he were a lot faster than \nI gave him credit for and he cracked me once, hard, across the face. I didn’t go \ndown, but I didn’t get him with the blade again before he slammed his elbow \ninto my gut. That time I did go down, and the knife dropped to the floor. He \nwas on top of me, hands around my throat, and I thought that was it, no \nwaiting for the cancer. Not going to lie, I was scared. \n \nJULIA \nI could still feel that dark water sticking to me, tugging at me, pleading at me to \nfall back into it. I pushed it from my mind, and I could just about make out the \nhomeless man that saved me. He was struggling with someone, his torch fallen \nto the ground next to an old pocketknife. I grabbed the light and pointed it at \nthem. Vardan was on top of him, hands around the old man’s throat. I saw \nthose eyes properly and, for the first time, I realised that Vardan’s irises \nweren’t dark, it was just that the pupils were so wide that they swallowed \nthem completely. \n \nThat wasn’t what did it, though. That wasn’t what made me pick up the \nstruggling tramp’s pocketknife and plunge it in again and again to Vardan \nDarvish’s throat. No, what did that was the tattoo, huge and dark on the chest \nbeneath his ripped shirt. The closed eye sigil that was as familiar to me as the \nnightmares of my mother. I have never felt rage like I did then, and I have \nnever felt any sensation as wonderful as the satisfaction of ending his life. \nThere was a shiver in the air as the floor behind me dried in an instant, and the \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG109 – Nightfall \n \n18 \n \nthree silent screamers dropped down dead. Well, I suppose they might have \njust been unconscious when they fell, but they were definitely dead by the \ntime we left. The man on the table had never been alive to begin with. \n \nTREVOR \nI just knew, then. I never even had to explain anything to her. She just gave me \nback the knife and we left together. Wasn’t any question as to who I was or \nwhat I was doing. We just clicked. \n \nJULIA \nAnd we’ve been hunting together going on seven years now. \n \nTREVOR \nShe ain’t too bad at it. \n \nJULIA \nHe’s starting to slow down a bit, though. \n \nTREVOR \nIt’s just the lack of respect that gets me. \n \nJULIA \nAnd he’s going a bit senile, which is a shame. \n \nTREVOR \nLeast I’m not so soft I need a feather bed. \n \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG109 – Nightfall \n \n19 \n \nJULIA \nBeds are a good thing, old man, I keep telling you. So are baths. \n \nTREVOR \nYou see what I’ve got to put up with, Mr Sims? \n \nARCHIVIST \nI, um... Yeah, it’s... What do you do for money? \n \nJULIA \nSorry? \n \nARCHIVIST \nI-I-I j-just … I doubt roaming around killing things pays all that well. What, what \ndo you do to support yourself? \n \nJULIA \nOh, I don’t know, we find ways.
