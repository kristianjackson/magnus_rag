At some \npoint the silence stopped being comforting and began to feel as though it were \npressing down on me. Even the rumble of the train’s movement seemed to be \nmuted, like it was being muffled somehow. \nI tried to take my mind off it. I scanned the adverts pasted above the row of \nchairs opposite me but they were blank. At least, they seemed blank when I \nfirst looked at them. Moving a bit closer I could see that there was something \nbehind the clear plastic. It was dirt. It looked as though each of the adverts had \nbeen covered in a layer of dry, tight-packed soil. I turned to the ones behind \nme, above my own chair, and saw the same thing. I reached up to touch one of \n\nthem, and was greeted with a small shower of grit, but still couldn’t see \nanything behind it. \nNow that I was looking for it I could see that it wasn’t only these signs that \nseemed to be covered in dirt. When I had first got in I had assumed the \ncarriage was just grimy from a full day of commuters, but everywhere I looked I \nsaw now that it was a thin dusting of dry earth. It was on the chairs, the floor, \neven the edge of the windows. Where I had been walking, I could see my \nfootprints clearly on the muddy floor. They were the only pair. \nI decided that I was going to get off at the next station. When I reached \nHighbury and Islington I knew there was a night bus that I could take to get \nhome. It would be slower, but it would get me off this train and that was now \nmaking me feel very uncomfortable. So I waited. \nI had been travelling for about three minutes at that point and I checked my \nwatch impatiently. Five minutes passed. Eight minutes passed. I was sure we \nshould have arrived at the next station by that point, but the train just kept \nmoving. We hadn’t gone through the next station; I was sure I would have seen \nit through the windows, and it certainly seemed to be going as fast as it \nnormally would. Faster, maybe, I don’t really know how to measure something \nlike that. Ten minutes went by, then fifteen, and there was no sign that the \ntrain was stopping, or even approaching another station. It shouldn’t have \nbeen possible, but it was. I just stood there, trying to keep my balance, not \nwanting to sit on the seats or hold on to the dusty handrail. The air had \nbecome thick, and I could smell the cold damp, like an old basement or a cave. \nAfter almost twenty minutes I walked over and pulled the emergency lever in \nthe hopes that it might have some effect. I had to dig out several handfuls of \n\nsticky mud from around the handle before I could even reach it. I gripped it \nfirmly and pulled. It snapped off in my hands and I could see the point where it \njoined the wall had been eaten away by rust. \nThat was when I finally decided to sit down and wait it out. Either it would \narrive somewhere or it wouldn’t, and if I had managed to wander into some \ngrubby ghost train then there wasn’t much I was going to be able to do about \nit. I stopped checking my watch and just sat there. \nAt some point I felt the train beginning to slow. There was no indication of \nwhere we were, and the automatic station announcements were silent. I \nstayed in my seat. It was one of the few times in my life I have regretted being \nan atheist, as I think I would have valued having a god to pray to. By the end \nwe were going so slowly that I didn’t even notice when we finally stopped for \nalmost twenty seconds. I looked at the doors, but they showed no sign of \nopening, and the other side was still just the bare wall of the underground \ntunnel. We were not at a station. \nI had already decided that, whatever might be out there, not being in the train \nwas better than staying put, so I did my best to force the doors open. It was \nsurprisingly easy, and once I had gotten them an inch or two apart, something \nmust have tripped and they slid the rest of the way on their own. The other \nside was the wall of the tunnel. But rather than the normal cables and \nconstruction you would expect from the Underground, this was bare earth. It \nwas slick with damp, and instead of the two-foot gap you would expect to be \nbetween the door and the wall, it came right up to the lip of it. There was no \nclearance at all: the doors seemed to be completely flush with this solid barrier \nof soil.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 1, "chunk_count": 5, "chars": 4324}}
