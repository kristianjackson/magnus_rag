For the Institute serves a being variously known as: The \nEye, It Knows You, The Beholding, The Ceaseless Watcher. It is the fear of being \nwatched, and judged, and having all your secrets known. The Institute serves \nas a way for it to harvest the fears of the other entities, dragging out the \nsuffering of those who come to give statements and claiming their terror. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 161 – Dwelling \n24 \nBut, there is another part of being the Archivist. These beings, these gods of \nfear— their followers believe that they have... rituals. Grand projects which, if \nsuccessful, would allow them to enter our world, reshaping it in unthinkable \nways. Moulding it into a dimension where terror is as natural as gravity. \nYou are now one such ritual. \nI do not know the exact details of it, but be wary of whatever Elias asks you to \ndo. \nOh, yes. On the subject of Elias: Trust nothing he says. He was originally known \nas Jonah Magnus, the founder of this Institute, and I have known him also as \nJames Wright, the previous head of the Institute. \nHe has certain... abilities of clairvoyance, which allow him to perceive out of \nany eye, real or symbolic, so be wary. Play ignorant as long as you can while \nyou expand your own research. \nI’ve managed to keep the Archives in a state of chaos for decades, as I believe \nhis plan would benefit from their organization. But I leave that to your \njudgement. Certainly, the longer he is ignorant of how much you know, the \nbetter. \nAbove all else: be ready. There are many things out there loyal to other powers \nwhich know your importance to the Eye, and will want. You. Dead. \nYou are entering a new world, a place I’ve lived for most of my life. A place... \n(sighs) A place that will often demand a high price from you. Pay it without \nhesitation, because one way or another, the world is now on your shoulders. \n(Sigh) I wish I had more time to explain it to you. But time is short, and \nhopefully my actions tonight will ensure that this tape never needs to see the \nlight of day. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 161 – Dwelling \n25 \nBut if you are hearing it, then- good luck. Do what you have to do. \n(She sighs, heavily) \n[A squeak as the Archivist’s office door opens] \nJURGEN LEITNER \nAre you finished? \nGERTRUDE \nJurgen! I told you to stay in the tunnels. \n[Jurgen walks in] \n[A chair is pulled out] \nJURGEN \nYour message also told me it was urgent. \nGERTRUDE \n(Sharper) If Elias is watching right now— \nJURGEN \nThen your recording all that was meaningless anyway. Besides, I’m not afraid \nof him. \nGERTRUDE \nBravado. Hah-Really? \nJURGEN \nMmmmm- it’s not bravado— \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 161 – Dwelling \n26 \nGERTRUDE \nWe’re wasting time. Do you still have the Ruskin book? \nJURGEN \nI do, though I don’t relish the thought of using it. Makes it rather hard to \nbreathe, like your chest is being— \nGERTRUDE \n(Interrupting) You know the gas main, a little way out in the tunnel? \nJURGEN \nI do. \nGERTRUDE \nI need you to move it. \nJURGEN \n(Hem-and-haw) Iiiii, ummmm. That’s. I mean it’s not just earth; there’s \npipework, and all sorts of— \nGERTRUDE \nFind a way. I need it to be directly under the Institute, or at least closer. \nJURGEN \nI’m more likely to rupture it and fill the place with gas. \nGERTRUDE \nHm, that would also be acceptable. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 161 – Dwelling \n27 \nJURGEN \nMmm. I’ll do what I can. When do you need it? \nGERTRUDE \nIf my guess is right, the Church’s ritual should be collapsing any time now, so— \nimmediately. \nJURGEN \nAnd if you’re wrong? \nGERTRUDE \nThen a bit of gas will be the least of our worries. \nJURGEN \n...Right. What are you going to do? \nGERTRUDE \nPaper burns well. \n[She holds up a container of sloshing liquid] \nGERTRUDE (CONT’D) \nPetrol burns better. \n(Leitner laughs) \n[The container sloshes again as Gertrude sets it down] \nJURGEN \nI always forget your pyromaniac streak.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 4, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 4223}}
