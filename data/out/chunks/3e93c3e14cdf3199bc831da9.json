I realised I had never seen him wear a suit before. Like \neverything else in his death, it seemed utterly alien to the life that had he had \ncreated for himself. I remember going to my father’s funeral when I was very \nyoung. I remember seeing him lying there, after the undertakers had done \ntheir business. My father had looked serene, peaceful, like he had calmly \naccepted the reality of his passing. It had comforted me, as a child, though it \nhad done little to blunt the acute sense of loss I felt. There was none of that on \nEvan’s face. In death he seemed to have that same hardness and reproach that \nI saw on every one of the silent family that claimed him for their own. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG013 – Alone \n9 \n \nI don’t know how long I stood there. It felt like seconds, but when I turned \naround I almost shrieked to see dozens of black-clad figures stood there, \nstaring at me. The rest of the Lukas family were standing, waiting without a \nword, as though I was between them and their prey. Which I suppose, in some \nways, I was. Finally, an old man walked forward. He was small and hunched \nwith age, his black suit hanging off his body like sagging flaps of skin. He spoke, \n“It’s time for you to leave. The burial is a family affair. I’m sure you want to be \nalone.” \nI tried to reply but the words stuck in my throat. They stood there, waiting for \nme to respond or to leave, and I realised the old man was right. I did want to \nleave, to be alone. I didn’t care where I went, but I had to go, to get away from \nthat awful place with its strange quiet watchers. I ran past them and out into \nthe storm. Inside my car, I just turned on the engine and began to drive. I \ndidn’t know where I was going, and could barely see a thing through my tears \nand the driving rain, but it didn’t matter. Just as long as I kept going, as long as \nI didn’t have to stop and think about what had just happened. Looking back, \nthe only thing that surprises me about the crash is that it wasn’t bad enough to \nkill me. \nWhen I became aware of myself again, I realised I was in the middle of a field, \nquite a distance from the road. The tracks behind me showed where I had \nskidded into the dirt. Luckily I hadn’t hit anything or flipped over, but smoke \nbillowed from the engine of my poor old Astra, and it was clear I wasn’t going \nanywhere. It was dark, and the time on my dashboard said twelve minutes past \neleven. My phone said the same thing. I had arrived at Moorland House at 6 \no’clock, as instructed. Had I been driving for hours, or had I spent even longer \nwith Evan’s body than I thought? I hadn’t hit anything, so I couldn’t have been \nknocked unconscious. Had I just been sitting there in my smoking car all that \ntime? \nIt didn’t matter. The rain was beating down hard, and I needed to get some \nhelp. I tried to call the emergency services or use the GPS on my phone, but \nthe screen just said “NO SERVICE”. I took a deep breath, trying to stifle panic, \nand got out the car. I was soaked through in less than ten seconds, as I \nstruggled through the downpour towards the road. I could hear no sound \nexcept for the howling wind, and there were no headlights anywhere to be \nseen. Having no idea where I was, I made the decision to turn right and began \nto walk.
