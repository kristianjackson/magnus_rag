At one point he was hammering directly \nover the light, causing it to sway slightly with each blow. This went on for \nalmost an hour, and all I could do was try to ignore it, as there was nothing I \nwanted to do less than climb those stairs and knock on his door. Even so, by \nthe time it finally finished I was on the verge of doing exactly that. It did stop, \nthough, and after it became clear it wasn't coming back any time soon, I tried \nto put it out of my mind and get back to my preparations. \nThankfully, there was no disturbance from upstairs during my small party the \nfollowing night, just the family from across the hall at one point asking for the \nmusic to be turned down. In fact, I didn't hear anything from him for another \ntwo weeks, when the banging started again. Again it was almost an hour of \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG018 – The Man Upstairs \n5 \n \nhammering, first into the walls, then moving down onto the floor, before \nstopping altogether. I was not happy about this, as I'm sure you can imagine, \nbut I was still reluctant to confront this nameless person who lived over me, so \nI let it slide. From that point on, every two weeks it came, the hammering, for \nan hour or thereabouts. I tried to find someone to complain to, but it seemed \nlike whoever lived there owned the flat outright, so there was no landlord or \nhousing association that I could report him to. \nThe final straw came about six months later; it was actually a very simple thing. \nI got a package delivered incorrectly to my flat. It was addressed to Mr. Toby \nCarlisle, and the flat number on it was not mine but that of my upstairs \nneighbour. The envelope was thick and soft, must have been mainly full of \nbubblewrap or other packing material. It wasn't much, but it gave me another \nreason to go upstairs and, while delivering it, I could politely request that he \nstop his fortnightly hammering. \nIt was harder than I thought to walk up those stairs and I was surprised to find \nthat my legs were shaking slightly as I reached the top. I got another whiff of \nthat dank, rotten smell as I approached. The carpet immediately in front of the \ndoor was stained ever-so-slightly, a darker colour than it should have been, as \nthough something had leaked out from underneath it. The wood was old and \nworn compared to the others in the building, which looked to have been \nreplaced relatively recently. There was no number on it, or any indication that \nit was, in fact, Toby Carlisle who lived there. I knocked, trying to give the action \na confidence that I frankly did not feel. \nThere was no answer, so I knocked again, louder this time, and I heard some \nmovement from inside, gradually heading towards the door.
