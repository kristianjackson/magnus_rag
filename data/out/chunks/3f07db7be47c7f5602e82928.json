Stupid umbrella. Does it think there is a monsoon \ncoming? Does it even remember what a cloud of water vapor looks like? The \nclouds that pass now are oily and stink of sulphur, waiting for you to stop \npaying attention before they climb down your throat and settle in your lungs. \nPerhaps this idiot apparatus thinks it can protect from the relentless heat of \nthe sun, but its fabric is torn and ruined, hanging from the snapped metal \nlimbs, desperate for a breeze to stir it from its, complete stillness. Take a \nmoment to sneer at this corpse of an umbrella, and wish for a moment you \nhad water enough within you to spit on it. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 175 – Epoch \n6 \nLeah can barely tell what she's writing anymore. The catalogue of horrors she's \ncompiling, this report on everything for nobody, but what else is she to do? \nWhat else can even come close to quelling the fear that suffuses her \nexistence? \n[Metal jangles and cawing crows fade away] \n[In the distance starts the strange bellows of an unknown animal; \ncloser there is the sound of slithering and clambering, and a \nrepeated rattling and hissing cry] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nFauna: The thing that lives. \nSomething lives in the Anthropocene age. Not a twisted reflection of a natural \nworld, not a parasite or a scavenger or a cockroach, but a native. Something \nborn in the sloping shells of sagging concrete towers, that tastes the tang of \nrusted iron in the air and knows that it is home. Something that does not know \nor care what a human is, any more than mankind thought of the creatures that \nonce lived in the shells they found on the beach. It moves through the stacks of \ngarbage like a beetle through filth, and its smile is all-too familiar, though its \neyes are dark and empty. \nIt cannot be seen in its entirety, for it keeps itself covered, but its long, \nunfurling tongue may be seen emerging, pink and bristling with long, hairlike \ntastebuds, hunting for something old enough to eat. It whispers to itself in the \ndark, and sounds like snippets of old toothpaste commercials and adverts to \njoin the army. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 175 – Epoch \n7 \nIt is hard to tell if there is more than one, but either there are several of them \nof different sizes, or there is just the one, and it is getting bigger. It is our \nreplacement, and it is welcome to the world. \nEven if Leah had known, if she had had time to warn them, who would have \nbelieved her? Who would not have laughed her out of her life if she had \ndescribed the horrors that were to come in their true and vivid detail? But \nthere is no one left to warn, though that does not slow her hand even a \nmoment. She ignores the burning pain in her forearm, where the thing's rough \ntongue has torn a section of her skin clean off. \n[The distant bellows and rattling cry fade away; leaving just the \nsounds of the air raid sirens, sporadic debris movement and \ndistorted caws] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nItem: A forgotten bone. \nWhose is this? Pale white and stained with thick black tar. \nA human bone, that much is clear; too big to be a child's, at least. Can a bone \nseem familiar? The shape of it echoing through your mind, like a face seen only \nin dreams? It may be followed up to a ribcage, still sticky in places with soapy \ncadaver fat, and closing around a crumpled beer can where the heart should \nbe. There's a skull as well, yellowing in the thick dust of the open air. \nStrange. Everything here is either bone-dry from relentless heat, or damp \nthrough from decomposition and stagnant decay. Lifeless yet decaying. The \nworld we have left behind. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 175 – Epoch \n8 \nLeah considers the bones for some time. Does she know them? Are they hers? \nIf she had been quicker, more forceful in her warnings, might they still be \nalive? Her pencil is broken, but her notes, her warnings from this new world \nare far from complete. \n[Hissing static starts] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nShe snaps off another rib and continues writing. \n(A soft sigh from the Archivist) \n[Hissing static ends] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nRight. \n[Tape clicks off] \n[Tape clicks on] \n[Sounds of distant air raid sirens, distorted crow caws, and trash \nmovement] \n[Martin and the Archivist walk, their crunching footsteps \noccasionally kicking away trash] \nMARTIN \nYou know what? I am sitting down. \n[They stop walking] \nARCHIVIST \nAre… you sure? That thing is... that's not in great shape.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 2, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 4491}}
