Audio recording by \nJonathan Sims, Head Archivist of the Magnus Institute, London. \nStatement begins. \nARCHIVIST (STATEMENT) \nWhy do you need me to live it over again? To recount a story you know well \nenough already. \nYou were there, at least for the parts worth discussing. You want me to tell you \nwhat happened before then? How I met Benoît? His character? How he \nbecame my friend? \nTruth be told, he was not my friend. He was simply a colleague, someone I \nmight describe myself as well-disposed to, but probably not even that. It may \nseem dismissive to you, but in my experience there are two situations where \none finds themselves working behind a bar when over the age of forty. The \nfirst is that you own the establishment yourself, what the English call ‘a \n\npublican’, and see no reason to hire others to perform duties you are quite \ncapable of yourself. \nThe second is when a profound failure in your life has brought you to the \nmiddle of your life with no wealth, no prospects, and no skills that could be \napplied in more lucrative avenues. \nSuffice it to say that Benoît Maçon did not own Le Papillon Blanc. \nIt was not one of the most fashionable spots in Toulouse, sitting just on the \nedge of where the tourist-facing centre meets the firmly residential, and never \nquite settling on either side. It billed as a cafe in the day, but most of its \nbusiness was after dark, when all pretence was dropped, and it became simply \na comparatively cheap place to drink. I worked the bar there with Benoît and a \nfew others, and had done for a couple of years since I left school. Of all the \nothers who worked Le Papillon alongside me, I would probably have said that \nBenoît was the one who interested me the least. There was an air of sadness \nabout him, a melancholy that I found unsurprising, given the position he had \nfound himself in, but distasteful nonetheless. My own life has certainly had its \nhardships, and I cannot help but detest those who indulge in self-pity. \nThough… having seen his fate, perhaps some pity was earned. \nBenoît was, as far as I could tell, all alone in the world, and rather unhappy \nabout the fact. It was rare that the topic of parents or family would be raised \nor discussed without his appearing, as if from nowhere, to quietly volunteer \nthe fact that his parents were dead, or his lack of siblings, or whatever it might \nhave been. Whatever familial bond was the topic of conversation, Benoît \nMaçon did not have it, and expected, no, demanded that you pity him for the \nfact. It will not surprise you to learn he wore no wedding ring. That when a", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 2, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 3522}}
