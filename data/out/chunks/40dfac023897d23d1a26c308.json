But I’m not mad and he’s not seeing any doors. I’m sorry he’s \nso lonely, truly I am. I try to see him as much as I can, but I have my own life \nand I can’t be there all the time. And I don’t like being manipulated. I don’t like \nbeing lied to. \nThe first door I remember seeing that shouldn’t have been there must have \nbeen when I was five or six. I had this skipping rope, bright green, old and ratty. \nI made my mum buy it for me at a car boot sale and I loved it. I could spend \nhours on the playground just stood there, jumping happily.

I don’t remember panicking. I’m not \neven sure I was scared, not at that point, but I didn’t like anyone else except \nmy friends touching my toys, so I got up and hurried to follow. I chased it \nsleepily out of my bedroom and down the hall, past the stairs and towards ... a \ndoorway I didn’t recognise. I was sure that when I’d gone to bed it had been a \npatch of wall with a painting of an old sailboat on it, but now it was an open \ndoorway. A small amount of light leaked from around the edges of the door to \nmy parents’ room, behind me, but it didn’t reach very far at all, and beyond \nthe threshold it was completely dark. That was when I started to feel scared. \nI could see the wooden handle of my skipping rope lying in the corridor, with \nits heavy green cord stretching out and into the door, until it disappeared in", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 1, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 2721}}
