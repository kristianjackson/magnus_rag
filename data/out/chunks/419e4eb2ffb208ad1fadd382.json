It was stood way off in the \ndistance, a long way down the corridor. It seemed almost human from a \ndistance, but as it got closer, I saw that it was anything but. Its body was thin \nand limp and when it moved, it shifted like I was watching it through rippling \nwater. Its hands were swollen and bits of them jutted out at annoying angles. It \nwas... it was moving towards me fast and as I looked, I saw that all the pictures \non the wall now showed this thing, although each distorted it differently, like a \nselection of funhouse mirrors. But all of them... all of them showed the hands \nas bulbous and sharp. \nI looked around in desperation, trying to find any hope of escape. The thing \nwas getting closer and closer and I could hear that weird laugh again. And then \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG047 – The New Door \n9 \n \nI saw it: a mirrored frame that did not contain the creature. I had no reason to \nthink it would help, but I could see no other choice but waiting for death, so I \nthrew myself at this empty mirror. \nAnd just like that I was out. I felt the cold night air on my face and wet tarmac \nunder my hands and knees. It was raining. I’d turned up in Dulwich of all \nplaces. I screamed for about five minutes before someone came to help me. \nI don’t really know what else to tell you. I was hospitalised for a short while \nuntil they were satisfied my dehydration wasn’t going to cause any \ncomplications and I spent a long time at home, not opening any doors. Finally, \nafter the latest bout of nightmares, I decided to come to you and tell you my \nstory. Maybe you can make some sense of this. \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nPerhaps. Leave it with us. We’ll do some digging and see what we can find. \n \nHELEN \nYou believe me then? \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nI... yes. Yes, I think I do. One thing though – you say you don’t remember the \nman’s name? \n \nHELEN \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG047 – The New Door \n10 \n \nI... I think he told me, but I just... I can’t... \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nIt wasn’t ‘Michael’, was it? \n \nHELEN \n(Gasps) Yes! Michael! That was it! Do you know him? \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nMaybe. We’ll make some enquiries and get back to you, Ms Richardson. Thank \nyou for your time. \nHELEN \nRight, well... I’ll just leave you to it then. \n \n[DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES] \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \n(Calls out) Sasha! \n \n[DIFFERENT DOOR OPENS] \n \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG047 – The New Door \n11 \n \nNOT!SASHA \nSorry, did you call? \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nI just had a statement from someone claims they met your ‘Michael’. \n \nNOT!SASHA \nMichael? The distorted Michael? \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nThe very same. I don’t think we re-recorded your statement on him, did we? \n \nNOT!SASHA \nDid we need to? \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nIt was one of the tapes that vanished during the attack. \n \nNOT!SASHA \nOh, well I can give it again if you’d like, but I haven’t seen him since. \n \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG047 – The New Door \n12 \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nAnd you can’t think of any further insight? Nothing you forgot to mention last \ntime? \n \nNOT!SASHA \nI don’t think so, no. \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nHm. What are you doing at the moment? \n \nNOT!SASHA \nRe-organising your ‘Discredited’ section. It’s a bit of a mess. If I may say so, \nJohn, I feel you’ve been a bit less conscientious about it since you got back. \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nNo, that’s fair. Sorry. Let me know once you’re finished. I’d very much like you \non this case. \n \nNOT!SASHA \nYes, will do. \n \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG047 – The New Door \n13 \n \n[NOT!SASHA LEAVES] \n \nMICHAEL \nDo you even know they’re lying to you? \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \n(Surprised voice) I’m... I’m sorry, I didn’t... can I help you? This place is off-\nlimits. \n \nMICHAEL \nI disagree. \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nWho let you in here? \n \nMICHAEL \nLet? \n(Strange laugh) \nI’m afraid that isn’t how this works. \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG047 – The New Door \n14 \n \nYou’re him. \n \nMICHAEL \nYes. \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nMichael. \n \nMICHAEL \nThat is a real name. \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nAre you here to kill me? \n \nMICHAEL \nNo. \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nOh... why are... why are you here? \n \nMICHAEL", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 3, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 4169}}
