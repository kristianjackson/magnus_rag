I have no power to arrest anyone, revoke any licences \nor even issue a fine without a good deal of hassle. That all comes later and \nfrom other people. My job is just to discuss their compliances and policies to \nprevent money laundering, and examine their transactions to confirm that \nthey’re not too suspect. I find it fascinating, but I am keenly aware that the \nmajority of the people I inspect do not share my opinion. \nAs soon as I arrived at The Trophy Room, I could tell that it was going to take \nsome time. The shop had that layer of grime that only accumulates after a \nbusiness has been in place for decades without change. The painted golden \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 054 – Still Life \n4 \n \nletters were now a dirty brown and the edges of the olive-green awning were \nstreaked with muck. The stuffed tiger in the window was so faded by the sun \nthat I had to do a double take to check it wasn’t a lion, so faint were the \nstripes. Its eyes were glassy and one of its teeth seemed to have broken off. \nEven so, there was something about the curve of its mouth that drew me in \nand I got so lost looking at it that I quite jumped when the bell above the door \nsounded its jarring clang. \nI looked up to see a surprisingly young man standing there. I had expected \nsome crusty old gamekeeper type, judging by the look of the place, but instead \nthis fresh-faced 20-something held out his hand for me to shake. I did so. The \nhand was firm and very dry. I asked him if he was the owner and he said he \nwas, introducing himself as Daniel Rawlings. Apparently, the place had \nbelonged to an old friend of his father’s, who didn’t have much in the way of \nfamily, and when he’d passed away a few years before, Daniel had inherited it. \nI asked him if he was even interested in taxidermy and he just shrugged and \ngestured me inside. \nThe smell hit me as soon as I crossed the threshold. It was so thick you could \nalmost taste it, like something had murdered a lily and it was rotting under the \nfloorboards. Dreadful smell. I turned to see Daniel lighting a cigarette, as if in \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 054 – Still Life \n5 \n \nacknowledgment of the odour. He just shrugged again and said it was \nchemicals, casting an eye over the assembled collection of taxidermied wildlife. \nIt was then I became aware of them: hundreds of glassy, dead eyes staring at \nme from all directions. A huge moose in front of me; a shelf full of squirrels \nalong the wall; unmoving ravens attached to an old electric chandelier; and \ndozens and dozens of fish, mounted on plaques or sealed in fake tanks. Fur, \nfeathers, scales… Every manner and type of dead skin surrounded me, each \nfrozen in uncanny stillness, as though they were trapped in a world where time \nhad simply stopped. Everything except their eyes, of course. Their eyes had \nnever been alive, and they all seemed to stare in my direction, so that to look \ntoo close at any of them was to gaze into that unseeing glass. \nI took a moment to compose myself and tried to remember that I had made a \ndecision to not judge the shop or its owner based on the fact that many \nconsider taxidermy unsettling. I could see myself becoming one of these \npeople and I fought very hard against the feeling of wrongness that seemed to \nbe trying to worm itself into my mind. I forced myself to pay Daniel some \nvague compliment about the variety of his pieces as he lit another cigarette. I \nconsidered mentioning the smoking ban, but that wasn’t really why I was \nthere, so I just started talking about money laundering instead.
