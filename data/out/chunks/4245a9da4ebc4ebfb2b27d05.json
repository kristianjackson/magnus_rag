Episode one hundred and fifty-five. \nCost of Living. \n[Tape clicks on.] \nARCHIVIST \nAny luck? \nBASIRA \nNo. If they’re still around, they’re staying hidden. \nARCHIVIST \nNot like there’s any shortage of places to lay low. \n \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 155 – Cost of Living \n2 \n \nBASIRA \nHmm. London’s what, 600 square miles? \nARCHIVIST \n607. \nBASIRA \n(Sighs) Whatever. \nARCHIVIST \nSo I guess we’ll want to look out for a pair of homeless serial killers now. I’ll add it \nto the list. \nBASIRA \nNo sign of Annabelle either. \nARCHIVIST \nYou still on that? \nBASIRA \nYou’re not? \nARCHIVIST \nI mean... I don’t know how much she can predict or manipulate the future, but I \nthink she’s proven she can at least avoid us finding her. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 155 – Cost of Living \n3 \n \nBASIRA \nYeah, well, it makes me feel better. \nARCHIVIST \nI suppose that’s something. How’s Daisy? \n BASIRA \nI don’t know. She’s recovered from your little… confrontation, but she’s still \ngetting weaker. I’m worried she’s - \nARCHIVIST \nYeah. \nBASIRA \nWhy did you call her and not me? \nARCHIVIST \nHonestly, I panicked. Her name came up first on my phone. \nBASIRA \nI’m trying to convince her to go after them. To, uh... Hunt them. \nARCHIVIST \nWhy? \nBASIRA \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 155 – Cost of Living \n4 \n \nBecause I’m not going to lose her. \nARCHIVIST \nShe goes hunting again, you might anyway. \nBASIRA \nAnd if she doesn’t, she might die. \nARCHIVIST \nSomething you’re fine with in certain other cases, and something she’s made \npeace with. \nBASIRA \nBecause of the guilt she feels over the stuff the Hunt made her do. It’s not her \nfault. \nARCHIVIST \nEarlier, when she was still out of it, I... I saw some of the things she was talking \nabout, some of the things she did while she was police. I’m not convinced I \ndisagree with her assessment. \nDo you want me to tell you? \nBASIRA \nNo. No I don’t. \nARCHIVIST \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 155 – Cost of Living \n5 \n \nYou knew, didn’t you? You knew the sort of things she did, and you let her. \nBASIRA \nNo. Not exactly. I thought... It’s not that simple. \nARCHIVIST \nIt never is. But that doesn’t make it okay. \nBASIRA \nNone of us are who we were, Jon. \nARCHIVIST \nNo. I suppose not. In many ways it’s simpler now isn’t it? At least now our demons \nhave names. \nBASIRA \nHmm. \nARCHIVIST \nHave you thought any more about what I said? \nBASIRA \nYeah, I don’t think I can. Daisy wouldn’t come if I didn’t, and I’m not leaving her \nbehind. Besides, both of us being blind would be… anyway, being stuck here isn’t \nexactly her main problem right now. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 155 – Cost of Living \n6 \n \nARCHIVIST \nI suppose not. \nBASIRA \nAnd with those Hunters still out there-- \nARCHIVIST \nNo, I understand. Just wanted to make sure you knew you had the choice. \nBASIRA \nYeah. Anyway, I should go check on her. \nARCHIVIST \nSure. Do you mind closing the door? \nBASIRA \nStatement time. \n[Door swings shut] \nARCHIVIST \n(Sigh) Statement of Tova McHugh regarding their string of near-death \nexperiences.
