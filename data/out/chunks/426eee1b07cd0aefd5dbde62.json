We were all early twenties, \njust graduated and decided to spend a couple of weeks going crazy on the \ncontinent, so you can almost certainly fill in all the blanks yourself. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG002 – Do Not Open \n2 \n \nThere were very few points where I’d say that I was entirely sober and even \nfewer where I acted like it, though I wasn’t quite as bad as some of my friends \nwho had a hard time handling themselves at times. This may have been why I \nheaded out alone that morning – no idea of the exact date but it was \nsometime in mid-May. The others were sleeping off their assorted hangovers \nand I decided to head out into the beautiful sunshine of that Netherlands \nmorning and take a walk. \nBefore graduating from Cardiff with the others, I had been studying \nArchitecture, so was looking forward to spending a few hours by myself to \nwander, and really take in the buildings of central Amsterdam. I was not \ndisappointed – it’s a beautiful city, but I realised too late that I hadn’t taken \nany map or guidebook with me, and an hour or two later I was thoroughly lost. \nI wasn’t particularly worried, as it was still mid-afternoon at this point, and \ngetting lost in the backstreets had kind of been what I was trying to do, but I \nstill decided I’d better make an actual effort to find my way back to where my \nfriends and I were staying off Elandsstraat. I managed it eventually, but my \ninability to speak Dutch meant I spent a good hour riding the wrong way on the \nvarious trams. By the time I got back to Elandsstraat it was starting to get dark \nand I was feeling quite stressed, so I decided to pop into one of the cafés to \nrelax before joining up with my friends. \nI couldn’t say for sure exactly how long I was in there, but I do know it had \ngotten fully dark by the time I noticed I wasn’t sat at my table alone. I’ve tried \nto describe the man who now sat opposite me many times, but it’s difficult. He \nwas short, very short, and felt like he had an odd density to him. His hair was \nbrownish, I think, cut quite short, and he was clean shaven. His face and dress \nwas utterly unremarkable, and the more I try to think of exactly what he", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 0, "chunk_count": 9, "chars": 3091}}
