Not going to turn my \nnose up at the one bit of it that worked out well for me. I hunt monsters; my \nlungs don’t kill me. Seems like a fair trade.

It’s not like you or your tape recorder get to leave here without \nus. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG109 – Nightfall \n \n7 \n \n \nARCHIVIST \nThank you. (Cough) Statement of Julia Montauk, regarding her initial \nencounter with the hunter Trevor Herbert. When did this happen? \n \nJULIA \nAbout six years ago. \n \nTREVOR \nSeven. 2010. \n \nJULIA \nSure. Summer 2010. \n \nARCHIVIST \nStatement taken direct from subject, June 29th 2017. Statement begins. \n \nJULIA \nI tried to live a normal life. I really did. I took jobs working in the back room of \noffices where I wouldn’t need to meet anyone. I had boyfriends who promised \nthey didn’t care. I burned through a half dozen counsellors. None of it worked. \n \nYou see, my father has always remained one of the darlings of the true crime \ncommunity. Articles, documentaries, grisly retrospectives... Wherever I ended \nup, somehow it would always worm its way into my life. One of my co-workers \nor new friends would stumble across a profile of my father and that would be \nthat. Every time I ended up in a relationship, it was only a matter of time \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG109 – Nightfall \n \n8 \n \nbefore I caught them on some true crime blog, or spotted a profile of my \nfather in their search history. Sometimes I’d try to lie about it, say there was no \nrelation, but the damage was done. They’d get distant, throwing me nervous \nglances when they didn’t think I’d notice or, worse, they started to look at me \nlike I was some sort of prize, some small claim to fame: the serial killer’s \ndaughter! \n \nI suppose I could have changed my name. Something always stopped me, \nthough. It was the only connection I still had to my dad, and even if it did keep \nruining my life, I couldn’t bring myself to lose it. The counsellors and the \ntherapists were more understanding, but even they couldn’t quite keep the \neager quiver out of their voice when I started talking about the murders. It felt \nlike every couple of years I was having to start my life over from scratch. \n \nWhat is it, do you think, that makes people so obsessed with horrific things \nhappening to other people? Even now, after all I’ve done, I can’t quite figure \nout what it is that makes people treat actual atrocities like cheap \nentertainment. Maybe we’re all just broken inside, unable to really grasp the \ndifference between fictional people and people we just don’t know. They’re all \njust abstract ideas we’re happy to have suffer for our enjoyment. Or maybe the \nfact it really happened is exactly the point, adding the awful spice of reality to \npeople’s morbid fantasies. When I think of the lurid joy some people would \nfeel if I were caught, the serial killer’s daughter taking over the family business, \nit makes me sick. \n \nBut even back then, with my hands unbloodied, that collective obsession with \nbrutality chased me through my life.
