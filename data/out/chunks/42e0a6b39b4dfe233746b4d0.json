A room. A \ncavern. A way out. It is only as he slides inside so neatly that he realizes what it \nis. Another tunnel. For another worm. And as he falls deeper into it, he finds \nhimself staring at the pale and hairless face of its inhabitant. \nPoor Sam has no way to know his neighbour’s name is Richard, that he once \nstruggled in a life as hard and desperate as his own. That his dreams of the \nlight and painful screaming climb towards it is just as keen and gruelling. All \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 166 – The Worms \n15 \nthat matters is that this new worm is facing up. And Sam, because of how he \nentered the tunnel, is facing down. \n[Squelching worm sounds increase] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nHow do you fight, when you cannot move beyond the slowest inching crawl, \nwithout limbs or weapons or the kinetic force of violence? You do it slowly, \npressing, biting, tearing gradually through each other until at the very end, one \nof you is still. There is no light, for Sam is faced away from it, blocking it from \nhis opponent. But even were it bathed in stark illumination, no one could have \nsaid for sure where the sticky mud ended and the ragged, bloody faces began. \nA cloying mass of teeth and tears and torn skin as two terrified victims slowly \nchew through each other over a distant hope that neither would ever be \nallowed to achieve. \nWhen it is done, Richard is dead, or quiet enough as makes no difference, and \nthe tunnel belongs to Sam. It is identical to the one that he has left, in all ways \nother than that he had to do an awful thing to get it. And still he faces \ndownwards. He rests there for days, with nothing to keep him company but \nthe remains of his opponent, quietly mouldering, until at last he begins the \ngruesome task of turning around. The contortions that he undergoes, the \nbending and the breaking that he subjects his pale wormish body to, is a \ngreater pain than any he has thought possible, and the snap and pop of bone \nand sinew echoes to the surface far above. \n[Squelching worm sounds slow down, singing fades out] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 166 – The Worms \n16 \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nBut at last Sam has his victory: he has claimed another tunnel, and he can see \nthe light. Perhaps this one will be better, will let him squirm up higher. But \nunderneath is still that lurking fear that maybe, it is worse. \n[Wind, rain, and muffled screams begins to fade in, replacing the \nsquelching and underground noise] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nThe truth is plain enough, though, even as he fights so hard not to know it. \nThere is no difference, and as the rains begin to fall once again, he knows the \nworld will never let him escape the depths to which he has fallen. Better to \nkeep him buried, neatly away. \n(He sighs shakily) \nGod, I hate the Buried. \nEnd recording. \n[Tape clicks off] \n[Tape clicks on] \n[Wind and rain, with muffled screams and cries] \n(Martin sighs) \n(Beat) \nMARTIN \nKinda wish the apocalypse had some magazines. A-actually no, second \nthoughts, probably not. Ooh. Def-definitely not. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 166 – The Worms \n17 \n[He changes his posture] \nMARTIN (CONT'D) \n(Sigh) Come on, John. How long does it take to describe scary mud? \n[There is a wave of howls and screams from below] \n(Martin breaths shakily) \nMARTIN (CONT'D) \nOh, oh, o,okay, okay, okay— sorry, sorry! Sorry. \n[The wave subsides, the distant screams remain] \n[There is a faint electronic vibrating sound turning on and off; \nMartin turns] \nMARTIN (CONT'D) \n(Under his breath) Oh, god— (normal) What now? \n[He walks towards the noise, which buzzes at regular intervals; he \nstops; there is muffled musical notes accompanying the buzzing] \nMARTIN (CONT'D) \nWhat, seriously? A spade? \nIs that not kind of, I don't know, insensitive? Given where you are? \n(He sighs) \nFine. Fine, fine. \n(He sighs)", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 4, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 4049}}
