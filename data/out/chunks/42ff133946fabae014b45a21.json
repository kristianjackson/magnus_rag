It just sat there, and stared at me. I didn’t like staring back at it. It \nmade me feel strange, like it was sorting me into cuts of meat. There was more \nin those eyes than I’d ever seen in another pig; hidden among the rolls of pink \nflesh, they had malice in them. The pig wanted to hurt me. I’m sure of that. \nI-I didn’t know what to do. I just— I asked around to see if anyone knew where \nit had come from, but no-one had any idea. They were just as baffled as I was. \nThough they could see it, which was, you know, a relief. \n\nOr not, since it being real meant it had to be fed. Part of me did consider \nimmediately trying to send it for slaughter, but… but something about the way \nit looked at me, almost daring me to try it, a thin trickle of pink saliva glistening \naround its mouth. I’m absolutely sure if I’d asked Manawa, or any of the \nothers, to bring it out for that, they would be dead. In fact, the more I think \nabout the whole situation, the more certain I am that the monster pig wanted \nnothing more than to kill and eat me. It just didn’t want the hassle of breaking \nout of the sty. Though I’m sure it could have if it really wanted to. \nI tried to feed it, but it was so huge, it ate so much, and there wasn’t enough \nfor all the others as well. It wouldn’t need to be violent. It would just shift its \nmass towards the trough, and the other pigs would just be moved aside. When \nit ate, I got a closer look at that mottled body. It was covered in small lumps \nand marks that at first I thought might have been ticks or some other sort of \nparasite. But as I got closer, I saw that they were scars. Shot scars, most of \nthem, with some that looked like they might have been from spikes or axes. \nOne of them… looked like finger marks. As I stared at it, still stood in the pen, \nmy eyes darted again to the gate and the lock that was now looking far too \nflimsy. It could just leave and-and attack; there was nothing I could do to stop \nit. I just watched it eat all the food. \nNot enough food, apparently, since after a few days of this, it decided to \nsupplement its diet with poor Toby. I’d looked after Toby since he was born. I’d \nhelped birth him. He was my friend. So when I saw what was left of him lying in \nthe pigpen on that damp Tuesday morning, I’m not ashamed to say that I cried. \nHe was the first of my pigs to go, but I was sure he wouldn’t be the last. I tried \nto get the other pigs out a couple of times, move them to another pen, but the \nmonster would start to shift its weight towards me with alarming speed, and I", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 1, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 2797}}
