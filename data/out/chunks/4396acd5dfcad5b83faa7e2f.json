With every tale of love or society I feel more \nkeenly the absence of both. \nI went to Egypt once with the Royal Society, to the temple of Ramses the \nSecond in Abu Simbel. The place was remarkable, of course, but what sticks so \nkeenly in my mind is the journey. Two days earlier, on the road from Aswan, I \nfound myself separated from my fellow travellers. I do not know how it \nhappened, but I spent two hours alone there, under the blazing sun, staring \nacross the vast empty expanses of that ancient country. I revelled in the \nsilence, then, embraced the loneliness like an old friend. But now that friend \nhas devoured me, and I shall not emerge from its jaws. Not without your help. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG092 – Nothing Beside Remains \n5 \n \nAnd you must help me, Jonah. If anyone knows of what might break me from \nthis dreadful place, it is you. I know that what is done by those I cannot see \nmight be felt here – I have found glasses broken and pages torn that were not \nso the night before. It is my hope that if I leave a letter here, in your institute, \nyou might find it, you might be able to save me. I have no other hope. \nPlease, Jonah, if you have any compassion within your heart, you will not leave \nme in this place. \nYour loyal servant, \nBarnabas. \nELIAS \nJonah Magnus did leave him in that place, John. He got the letter, oh yes, and \nwas on good terms with Mordechai Lukas. He could have interceded, perhaps \neven saved him, but he did not. And it was not out of malice, or because he \nlacked affection for Barnabas Bennett: he retrieved those bones sadly enough \nwhen the time came. Bones that you can still find in my office, if you know \nwhere to look. No, it was because he was curious. Because he had to know, to \nwatch and see it all. \nThat’s what this place is, John, never forget it. You may believe yourself to \nhave friends, to have confidantes, but in the end, all they are is something for \nyou to watch, to know, and ultimately to discard. This, at least, Gertrude \nunderstood. \nLet us begin. \nMARTIN \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG092 – Nothing Beside Remains \n6 \n \nUh, sorry to interrupt, er, J-John’s here! And he’s – well he’s – He seems – He \nseems angry. Um, I actually think he’s brought a coup- \nDAISY \nBouchard. \nBASIRA \nEasy. \nARCHIVIST \nHello, Elias. \nELIAS \nGoodness, John. Whatever happened to your hand? And your neck? \nDAISY \nThat one was me. \nELIAS \nYou look a mess. \nARCHIVIST \n(Laughs) I’ve had a hell of a week. \nELIAS \nMartin, would you be so good as to fetch Melanie and Tim. I think it would be \nworth their time to be here. \nMARTIN \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG092 – Nothing Beside Remains \n7 \n \nEr. R-Right. Okay. I’ll just… what, go then? \n[The door closes.] \nDAISY \nOkay. Let’s do this. \nBASIRA \nEr, John? Do you… You want to get this on tape? \nELIAS \nNo need, Basira. I’ve already got one running. \nNow, you have something to ask me? \nBASIRA \nGo for it. \nDAISY \nBefore I strangle the grinning bastard. \nARCHIVIST \nElias. Did you kill Gertrude Robinson? And Leitner? \nELIAS \n(Sighs, like he’s enjoying himself) That’s… That’s quite nice, actually. Tingly… \nbut sort of freeing. (Laughs) You know, even Gertrude never properly tried to \ncompel me. I always wondered – \nBASIRA \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG092 – Nothing Beside Remains \n8 \n \nJust answer the question. \nDAISY \nOr don’t. \nELIAS \nOh, no need to worry about that. I just feel it’s only fair to wait for your \ncolleagues, John. They’ll want to hear this too. Uh, it’s also very important to \nme, in a personal capacity, that you understand I’m answering you of my own \nfree will. \nARCHIVIST \nI don’t care! \nELIAS \nI know, but I do. There’s so much of this place, of ourselves, twisted by forces \nfar beyond us. I just wanted you to know – \n[The door opens again] \nMARTIN \nUh, okay, okay, so I’ve got everyone, but I’m honestly kind of lost as to what’s \nhappening. \nTIM \nYeah, I… Oh, Christ, what is it now? \nMELANIE \nEr, yeah, same question, please.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 1, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 3978}}
