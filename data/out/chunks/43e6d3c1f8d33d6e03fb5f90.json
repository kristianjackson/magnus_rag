Well, this was the second, although I’m not \ngoing to pretend that I’m not glad to see the back of the place. It’s cos I kept \nasking about Samson, you know? And what I saw. And they really, really don’t \nwant me to make a stink about that. Because if he just disappeared one day, \ndidn’t come into work, that’s fine. I mean, not fine for his family, obviously, or \nfor the police who have to find him, but fine for the company. If he \ndisappeared at work, though, if what I think happened is even close to what \nactually happened, then that’s real bad news for them, and opens them up to \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 148 – Extended Surveillance \n \n12 \n \nall sorts of lawsuits and liability. I mean, it’s fine. I can get other jobs and it’s \nnot like I really want to be working there after what happened, but I just wish \nsomeone would take it seriously. It’s messed up, and I’m having a real hard \ntime getting it out of my head. \nSo, I work security, right? Used to be that a company or shop would have its \nown little security force they put together that did all the in-store and CCTV \nvigilance stuff. These days, it’s all centralised, though. You tend to have a \nbuilding, or a shopping centre, that will contract all the security work out to a \nsingle company, who’ll then cover all the businesses or shops. It’s easier from a \ncentralising point-of-view, and cheaper, which is what the owners like, but it \ndoes mean there tends to be a lot less stability in how it’s all structured, \npersonnel-wise at least. If you’re lucky, you’ll be assigned to a post and stay \nthere for years, getting to know the place, the systems and your co-workers. If \nyou’re unlucky or there’re contract difficulties, you could easily end up moving \nthrough two or three different places in as many months. \nThat was kind of the case for me and Samson. We were the odd men out in a \nlot of ways. We’d originally been brought in for a big corporate office block \nnear Liverpool Street, but there’d been some big problem and the whole place \nhad to be closed up for months. Samson said they found asbestos, I heard it \nwas a lease issue, but it doesn’t really matter. Point is, they’d hired us for a job \nthat no longer existed. I expected they’d just get rid of us, but I mean, to their \ncredit, they did try to do right. They did their best to fit us in with other \nsecurity teams. Over the last two years, we did a couple of data centres, a \n“digital marketing hub”, whatever that is, and three different office buildings \nnear Kings Cross. Trouble was, every time, almost as soon as we got there, \nthere’d be some personnel changes or expiring contracts or some other", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 2, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 2763}}
