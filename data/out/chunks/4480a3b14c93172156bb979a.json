Knowing Gertrude, I’m sure she had a backup \nplan if she had miscalculated — but she had not. The ritual failed. And all at \nonce, I realized what needed to be done. \nYou see, the thing about the Fears is that they can never be truly separated \nfrom each other. When does the fear of sudden violence transition into the \npanic of hunted prey? When does the mask of the Stranger become the \ndeception of the Spiral? Even those that seem to exist in direct opposition rely \non each other for their definition as much as up relies on down. To try and \ncreate a world with only the Buried makes as much sense as trying to conceive \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 160 – The Eye Opens \n \n14 \na world with only down. Every ritual tied itself so closely to a single power as to \nrender itself impossible. They could bring their patron close, but could not \nsever it from the others, and eventually it would be violently pulled back to the \nplace next to reality where they dwell. The solution, then, is simple: A new \nritual must be devised that will bring through all the Powers at once. All \nfourteen, as I had hoped I could complete it before any new powers such as \nExtinction were able to fully emerge. All under the Eye’s auspices, of course. \nWe mustn’t forget our roots. \nAnd there was only one being that could possibly serve as a lynchpin for this \nnew ritual: The Archivist. A position that had so recently become vacant, \nthanks to Gertrude’s ill-timed retirement plans. Because the thing about the \nArchivist is that, well, it’s a bit of a misnomer. It might, perhaps, be better \nnamed: The Archive. \nBecause you do not administer and preserve the records of fear, John. You are \na record of fear, both in mind as you walk the shuddering dread of each \nstatement, and in body as the Powers each leave their mark upon you. You are \na living chronicle of terror. Perhaps, then, if I could find an Archivist and have \neach Power mark them, have them confront each one and each in turn instil in \nthem a powerful and acute fear for their life, they could be turned into a \nconduit for the coming of this nightmare kingdom. Do you see where I’m \ngoing, John? \nIt does tickle me, that in this world of would-be occult dynasties and ageless \nmonsters, the Chosen One is simply that; someone I chose. It’s not in your \nblood, or your soul, or your destiny. It’s just in your own, rotten luck. \n[A clap of nearby thunder] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 160 – The Eye Opens \n \n15 \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nI’ll admit, my options were somewhat limited, but my god, when you came to \nme already marked by the Web, I knew it had to be you. I even held out some \nsmall hope you had been sent by the Spider as a sort of implicit blessing on my \nwhole project and, do you know what, I think it was. Of course, I had to bide \nmy time, get a measure of you before I began to push, learn how you worked; \nso I decided I would wait until something came for you, and see how you \nreacted. Attacks upon the Archives were not uncommon during Gertrude’s \ntenure, and, while she was always prepared, I made sure you would not be. I \nreasoned if you couldn’t survive a single encounter, you were unlikely to make \nit through all fourteen. So, when Jane Prentiss attacked, I watched eagerly, one \nhand on the gas release from the start. You acquitted yourself well enough, so \nI decided to see how much further you would get, though I waited until the \nworms were in you to pull the lever. I needed to make sure you felt that fear \nall the way to your bones. \nThe discovery that one of the Stranger’s minions had infiltrated the Institute in \nthe aftermath was certainly a pleasant bonus. Even if that sliver of paranoia, \nthat vague wrongness you couldn’t quite place wouldn’t count as a mark, it \nwas only a matter of time before it confronted you in a far more direct and \naffecting matter. Admittedly, given the advent of the Unknowing, I needn’t \nhave bothered. But what’s the old saying about hindsight? More important to \nme was Sasha’s encounter with the Distortion. If it had taken an interest, then I \nvery much wanted it to cross your path. \nSo I found one of its current victims and convinced her to make a statement. \nPoor Helen. I actually had to put her in a taxi myself, she was getting so lost on \nthose narrow London side streets. It worked, though.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 4, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 4406}}
