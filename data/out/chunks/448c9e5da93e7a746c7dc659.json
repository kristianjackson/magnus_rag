They wanted what we have, our \nperfect peaceful life, and so they dragged their sickness here and damned us \nall. The patrons speak quietly, as who can say for certain whether the face \nbehind a mask is a good, honest village face, or a sickness-bearing harbinger \nfrom beyond. \nAnd people do still come to the village, for however thick the paranoia, \nhowever terrible the disease, there are worse things beyond. They are \nstopped, of course. Beaten and stripped and checked head to toe for signs of \ninfection. The village council sees to that. Most are uncontaminated, though \nthat does little to save them, while others are already laced right through with \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 164 – The Sick Village \n4 \nfungus of their own. A few are spared brutality, and treated with such cordial \npoliteness you must have thought their inquisitors old friends. Though there \nseems on the surface no rhyme to such decisions, were you to look beneath \nthe coats, you might see the patterns of their mould were matched. \nIt is, alas, those who are unblemished that suffer worst. So incomprehensible is \nit that any from outside could be clean, that there might be another source or \nvector, the inspectors devise another theory. An invisible infection, a hundred \nTyphoid Marys spreading mildew and decay. They keep them in the post office, \nwrapped in chicken wire, prodded and jeered and watched. Should they begin \nto show signs of the rot, then maybe, just maybe, they can stay for now, \nthough nobody will doubt that it was they that brought the illness. But if they \nstay clean, if they continue to act like they are better, like they are above the \nsickness that it is certain they must have brought to the village, then that \ncannot be endured. So they are taken to the village green, and the scorch \nmarks at the base of the maypole get darker. \nThe villagers stand on the green to watch, ignoring the bending of the grass as \nit tries to worm its way through their boots. They watch the screaming \noutsider as the fire purifies them, and inside feel the gnawing panic of their \nown secrets. For how long ago did they really come to the village? How deep \ndid their roots go? Do any of them truly remember? What if they are an \noutsider? What if they’re found out? \nNo. Such fears are to be quashed and swallowed; they must stand strong; they \nmust stand together as one body against the mass of those beyond the village \nwho would see them degraded and destroyed. They cannot allow such secret \nterrors to break their unity. And the maypole watches over all. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 164 – The Sick Village \n5 \nThere is no house in town that has not found itself marked with the red cross \nof plague, but paint is fleeting and the villagers are so desperate to hide their \nstate. Night still falls here, if only to give those that wish it a chance to try and \nhide their frantic denials. As the weak dawn breaks, you may count the doors \nnow painted white, and see who is more conscientious in covering their spongy \nskin. The deception is pitiable, and yet deep down every villager knows the \nmould has marked them deeper than any of the others, and carries it as their \nmost secret shame. \nForemost in their denials are the village council, those loud and hardy souls \nwho have taken it upon themselves to police this place, to safeguard their \ntraditions and denounce the infection that is the right and proper punishment \nof those who would allow the village borders to be breached, and their ancient \nway of life to be compromised. Their masks are blue and red and white, and \ntheir coats are the colour of fresh ivory, stained sometimes with streaks of \ncrimson from their dutiful ministrations. None would dare accuse them of \ninfection, and to cross them or draw their eye is to invite the strongest \ndiagnosis. \nHead of the council is Jillian Smith. Her father’s father’s father’s father’s father \nbuilt the maypole, carved from a jackalberry tree and painted in the colours of \nthe village. This place is her home and her right and her duty, and woe to any \nfungus-riddled outsider who might believe it otherwise. For no one would \nspeak up if Jillian Smith were to mark you infected or declare you foreign. No \none would lift a finger as they dragged you to the green. Her gloves are purest \nwhite and never sullied, and they hide a cerulean mould that covers every inch \nof her, through skin, muscle, and organ, though she has no idea it ru", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 1, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 4500}}
