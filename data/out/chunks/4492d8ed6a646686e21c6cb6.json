Either billions suffer and life goes on, or billions suffer and life doesn’t. In \nthe grand scheme of things it’s all much of a muchness. \nMARTIN \nRight. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 151 – Big Picture \n21 \n \nSIMON \nSorry. Too big picture? I get that a lot. \nMARTIN \nNo, it’s… thank you. This has actually been quite helpful. \nSIMON \nI’d say any time, but honestly, if you see me again I may just throw you off \nsomething for a joke. How do you feel about roller coasters? \nMARTIN \nUm… neutral. \nSIMON \n(Disappointed) Oh. You’re no fun. \n[Footsteps walk away] \nBASIRA \nWho was that? \nMARTIN \nBasira, please, I don’t have time. \nBASIRA \n(Interrupting) I know you don’t. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 151 – Big Picture \n22 \n \nMARTIN \n(Warning) Basira, let go. \nBASIRA \nI don’t think so. Three weeks I’ve been waiting to catch sight of you, and now I \nfind you chatting with Simon Fairchild. No, you’re not pulling your little vanishing \nact on me. \nMARTIN \nHow did you know about- \nBASIRA \nYeah, Jon’s not the only one who listens to statements. \nMARTIN \nIt’s none of your business. \nBASIRA \nNo? because it seems to me like you’re panning around are two very dangerous \npeople right around the time you’re cutting all of us out. That makes me worried. \nIt makes me suspicious. Tell me I’m wrong. \nMARTIN \nYou’re wrong. \nBASIRA \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 151 – Big Picture \n23 \n \nSo what’s going on then? Talk to me. \nMARTIN \nIt’s. Complicated. \nBASIRA \nWhat, they’re just here out of the goodness of their hearts helping you save the \nworld from Extinction? \nMARTIN \nYou know about that? \nBASIRA \nYeah, Jon found the tapes you made for him - \nMARTIN \n(Frantically) Shh, shh! \nBASIRA \nFound a stash of them a while ago. I made sure he shared with the club. \nMARTIN \n(Frustrated) Well, there you go then. \nBASIRA \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 151 – Big Picture \n24 \n \nJohn may be going through the whole “we have to trust Martin” thing, but I’m \nnot. As far as I can see you’re either compromised or you’re being played, and I \nwant to know which. \nMARTIN \nI didn’t know Jon had listened to them already. \nBASIRA \nWell, he has. He seems to think you’ll come to him when you need him. I think \nyou’re feeding him what he needs to hear so he doesn’t bother you. \nMARTIN \nLook, I don’t have time for this. I don’t like that I have to work with Peter any \nmore than you do, and I didn’t know that Simon was involved until today. But I \nwould hope that you and Jon understood the importance of preventing an \napocalypse. \nBASIRA \nI guess I’m just a bit burned out on the end of the world. \nMARTIN \nYeah, well, that’s your problem. \nBASIRA \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 151 – Big Picture \n25 \n \nAnd if you really think this whole Extinction thing is it, why not come to us for \nhelp? \nMARTIN \nI can’t. Peter’s the one with the plan, and... it needs me to be alone. \nBASIRA \nAnd you don’t see anything suspicious about that? \nMARTIN \n‘course I do, but it might be the only way and... so far at least he’s been honest \nwith me. Awful, but honest. \nI need to do this. For everyone. \n(Long pause.) \nBASIRA \nYou’re not expecting to come out of this, are you? \nMARTIN \nI’ll do what I have to. If I’m right, no one else needs to get hurt. \nBASIRA \n(Sigh) Okay. You want to do whatever grand sacrifice you think is going to save \neveryone, go ahead. But you’d best be sure you’re not just playing their game. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 151 – Big Picture \n26 \n \nMARTIN \nI know what I’m doing. \nBASIRA \nWe’ll see. Don’t make me regret this. \nMARTIN \nYeah. \nDon’t tell Jon. Please. \nBASIRA \nFine. I can’t promise you he won’t just Know it, though. \nMARTIN \nHow is he? \nBASIRA \nHungry. But he’s keeping it together. \nMARTIN \n(Exhales) that’s good. Can I go now? \nBASIRA \nSure.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 5, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 3761}}
