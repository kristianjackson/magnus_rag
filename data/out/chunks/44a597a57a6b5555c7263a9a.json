His office surprised me, though, as it was almost \ncompletely bare, save for a desk and two chairs in front of it. There were no \ntables or bookshelves or filing cabinets or anything like that. He asked us to sit \ndown, and though he spoke with a very faint accent, his English was perfect. \nWe made small talk, but he seemed impatient, eager to talk about whatever it \nwas he wanted us to do. \nI asked him what the job was, and he stopped and looked at us closely. Then \nhe said he simply wanted us to dig a hole. An unusual request, but not an \nunreasonable one, so I asked him where it whereabouts this was going to be. \nHe rose, walked over to the corner and pointed at the floor. He said he needed \na hole put through the floor. I thought there would have been a basement \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG035 – Old Passages \n5 \n \nunder there, and he said no, the building’s basement didn’t go under these \nrooms. He smiled an odd little smile as he said it, which put me a bit on edge. \nNow, there was no way we could do a job like that without the building \nowner’s permission and I told Leitner this. He began to get shifty, then, and \ntried to tell us that he already had that permission. When we told him we’d \nneed to confirm it with the commercial landlord, he got very defensive, told us \nthat it was fine and he’d need to discuss it with some other contractors first. \nWhen we told him we’d just need to have a quick phone call with the owner, \nhe started screaming that we didn’t understand what we were talking about, \nthat he didn’t need to explain himself to the likes of us, and there were some \nthings that were too important, too powerful to be owned. Then he just \nstarted yelling at us in Norwegian until we left. We didn’t bother contacting \nthe owners of 100 Pall Mall in the end. \nIt was without a doubt the weirdest interview with a prospective client that \nwe’d ever had, and being so close to the site of it had Rachel and I reminiscing \nwhen this teenage burnout turned up. I asked him if he’d been eavesdropping, \nand he shrugged, and again asked what we had found. I was just about done \nwith this kid, and started to tell him that he was going to have to leave, when \nRachel interrupted me and asked what there was to find. The kid laughed, as \nthough he and Rachel were in on some private joke. “Can you smell it?” he \nsaid, and for a brief moment, I could smell something. Damp old stone and \nmusty paper, just a faint whiff. It took me off guard, and I think that was why I \njust stood there as he walked past me and picked up the hammer. He strode \nover to one of the walls and, with a swing stronger than I would have thought \npossible from his age and skinny frame, he buried it into the wall. I heard a \nscream, high-pitched, but it definitely didn’t come from any of us.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 2, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 2827}}
