Episode one hundred and two. \nNesting Instinct. \n[Tape clicks on.] \nELIAS \nLook, John, I understand you’re upset. \nARCHIVIST \nA month, Elias. And you did what, nothing? \nELIAS \nI was doing everything in my power to locate you. \n(The Archivist snorts.) \nELIAS \nEveryone was working on finding the ritual site. \n\nARCHIVIST \nYou didn’t tell them I’d been kidnapped, though, did you? \nELIAS \nIt wouldn’t have helped matters. Martin’s research, at least, would have been \nsloppier. \nARCHIVIST \nAnd imagine what might have happened if your rescue had been slower. \nELIAS \nSarcasm isn’t going to help, John. \nARCHIVIST \nThe only thing here that “isn’t going to help” is you. I am sick of relying on the \nkindness of things whose stated intention is to kill me. \nELIAS \n(Annoyed) I am sorry, John, that my powers have not yet reached the level of \nomniscience. And I am sorry that I have to spend so much time trying to help \nyou develop your own faculties, rather than explaining everything to you like a \nchild. But you have a job to do, and I cannot fight your battles for you. \nARCHIVIST \nAs far as I can tell, the only battles I’ve been fighting have been yours and \nGertrude’s. \nELIAS \n\nI should have thought preventing the horrific transformation of our world is \nnot solely my concern! \nARCHIVIST \nFine. At least we now know you’re of zero practical use here. So aside from \nsending me other people’s statements, what can you actually do to help? \nELIAS \nI have been trying to give you the information you need. \nARCHIVIST \nSure, when you’re not bashing its head in with a pipe. \nELIAS \nLeitner was... I will admit I possibly… overreacted to his sudden re-emergence. \nARCHIVIST \nHe could have helped. \nELIAS \nYou? No. To you he offered nothing but the crutch of simple answers. If I \nhadn’t stepped in he could have significantly stunted your development. Left \nyou defenceless. \nARCHIVIST \n(Sarcastically) Yeah. I can’t imagine what it must feel like to be defenceless. \nELIAS \n\nI do regret... Gertrude’s notes on the Unknowing are... lacking. I only shared \nthe statements for a reason. \nARCHIVIST \nS— You didn’t even know why you were sending me them to me, did you? Just, \nwhat, a box of random files she labelled? You were hoping I could figure out \nthe reason Gertrude chose them! \nELIAS \nThere is a possibility some of them were misfiled. \nARCHIVIST \nSo what do we actually know? \nELIAS \nJohn— \n[The Archivist hits the table.] \nARCHIVIST \nDon’t you dare “John” me. If you want my help, I’m going to need that crutch. \nELIAS \nGertrude believed that the Unknowing was going to take the form of a dance. \nIt required a great deal of intact human skin to clothe what she referred to as \nthe, er, the “corpse de ballet”, though I suspect that’s just her sense of \nhumour. There is also one, the “Danseuse Étoile” that requires a costume of \n\nspecial power or distinction. Gertrude believed that Orsinov and his circus \ncreated a dancer specifically for this role. \nARCHIVIST \nI-I’ve met it. Calls itself Nikola. \nELIAS \nThere’s also something else in the notes she calls the Choir, but no real detail \non that. As far as where it will happen, it’s a, a— \nARCHIVIST \nA wax museum. Old, mostly a-abandoned, I think. I-I don’t know exactly where, \nbut— \nELIAS \nThat still narrows it down significantly. I’ll, I’ll have the others start digging. \nARCHIVIST \nHow do we— How do I stop it? \nELIAS \nGertrude seemed to think that once the dance begins it’s tied to its location. \nSufficiently disrupting that might be enough to derail the ritual. She mentioned \nshe had acquired... something, for this purpose, but she gave no detail as to \nexactly what that might be. \nARCHIVIST \nAnd you can’t just... See where she put it. \n\nELIAS \nShe was... She got very good at hiding things from me. \nARCHIVIST \nHow embarrassing for you. Is there anyone else who might know what it is, or, \nor where? Aside from Leitner, or Gerard? \nELIAS \nSorry, Gerard Keay? \nARCHIVIST \nUh… yes? \nELIAS \nHow did you... Who, who told you he was working with Gertrude? \nARCHIVIST \nNo-one, I-I-I just... I read it in one of the statements. \nELIAS \nI don’t think you did. \nARCHIVIST \nBut… ah... \nELIAS \nYou just knew it.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 0, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 4376}}
