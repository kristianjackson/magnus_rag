It’s been \nover a year just to get it like this. I mean, I think the database was on John’s \nlist, but… \nMELANIE \nSo how do you track someone down? \nMARTIN \nOh, oh well, y’know, we’ve a few contacts in various record offices around the \nplace. Aside from that it’s just… just a bit of detective work, really. Er, Tim used \nto do a great line in impersonating people to utility companies. Ah, the number \nof times he got them to give him ‘his own’ address… \nMELANIE \nRight, right… Um, this one, the name is “Jude Perry”. Doesn’t mean anything to \nyou, does it? \nMARTIN \nUh… no. Did she give a statement? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG088 – Dig \n14 \n \nMELANIE \nNot yet. \nMARTIN \nWell. Sorry I can’t be more help. \nMELANIE \nSure. Oh, er, one other thing. Who do I talk to about Artefact Storage? \nMARTIN \nOh, er, depends what you need, probably Sonja. Why? Are you sure you’re \nready for it? \nMELANIE \nWhat’s that supposed to mean? \nMARTIN \nNo, no, I just, just… Y’know, it’s… There’s a lot of weird stuff in there. \nMELANIE \nI’m not an amateur, Martin. I know the sort of thing that’s in there. I just need \nto know who I talk to about missing pieces. \nMARTIN \nYeah, prob-probably Sonja. \nWait, why? What’s gone missing? \nMELANIE \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG088 – Dig \n15 \n \nAn old calliope organ. It’s there in the inventory, but no-one can find it when I \nask. \nMARTIN \nHuh. I mean, that’s not… great. Er, did you need it for something? \nMELANIE \nJust following up a statement. Trying to get a few answers, you know? \nMARTIN \nHuh. Well, if you find any, let me know. \n[Tape clicks off.] \n[The Magnus Archives Theme - Outro] \nThe Magnus Archives is a podcast distributed by Rusty Quill and licensed under \na creative commons attribution, non-commercial share alike 4.0 international \nlicense.
