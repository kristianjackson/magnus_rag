Al-Although I was just going to have a talk with Elias, so, uh, \nmaybe I can convince him to cut you some slack. \nMARTIN \nI wouldn’t hold my breath. \nMELANIE \nRight. Fair. Listen, you really look like you could use a drink. Um, me and Basira \nwere just about to pop out. So… do you want to join us? \nMARTIN \nIt’s like one in the afternoon. \nMELANIE \nAre you afraid of getting fired? \nMARTIN \nHuh. I’ll get my coat. \nMELANIE \nGreat. Just, um, gimme, gimme an hour or so. I, I just have a few things to take \ncare of… first. \n[Door opens] \nMARTIN \nHuh. (Deep sigh) Oh, um, er, end recording. \n[Tape clicks off. Tape clicks on.] \nMELANIE \nKnock, knock. \n\nELIAS \nAh, Melanie. Can I help you? \nMELANIE \nOh, not really. I, I just went out for some coffees, and, and thought I’d get you \none. \nELIAS \nHow very thoughtful. \nMELANIE \nI don’t know how you take it, but John likes his black, so… I, I thought that was \na fair assumption. \nELIAS \nIt was. However, I think I’d rather you drink it. \nMELANIE \nOh... er, what? \nELIAS \nThe coffee you brought me. \n[The sound of the cup being slid across a table.] \nDrink it. \nMELANIE \nN…N…No. Y-You’re okay. I’ve, I’ve got my own actually. It’s a… a decaf one… \n(Nervously chuckles). \nELIAS \nI assume you don’t believe me, then? That murdering me would also kill you? \nMELANIE \n\nI- I- I don’t know what you’re… \nELIAS \nCoffee is not as good for disguising tastes as you might think. And it’s even \nworse at disguising texture. Dissolved pills always leave such a, um, chalky \nresidue. \nMELANIE \nLook, Elias, I never— \nELIAS \nI assume this is your first time attempting to poison someone? Do you actually \nknow how many painkillers it takes to kill someone, or were you just hoping I’d \ntake enough to get sick, and you could finish the job... manually? \n[A clock ticks] \nMELANIE \n(Deep breath) Why…? Why bother asking then? Why bother if you know \neverything? \nELIAS \n(Chuckles slightly) I don’t know everything, Melanie. Do know how exhausting \nthat would be? I’ll tell you one thing I don’t know, and that’s how to convince \nyou that I’m trying to help. Honestly, you’re one of the lucky ones. But not if \nwe’re all dead thanks to an... overzealous attempt at independence. \nMELANIE \nI don’t need you to— \nELIAS \nLet’s have no more clumsy assassination attempts, alright? And we’ll say no \nmore about it. Consider this your first warning. Next time I shall have to \nescalate matters, and that won’t be a pleasant process for anybody. \nUnderstood? Melanie? \n\nMELANIE \nYes. \nELIAS \nGood. \nMELANIE \nDid…? Did you turn that on? \nELIAS \nHmm? Oh. You get used to it. \n[Tape clicks off.] \n[The Magnus Archives Theme – Outro] \nJONATHAN SIMS \nThe Magnus Archives is a podcast distributed by Rusty Quill and licenced under \na Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Sharealike 4.0 International \nLicense.
