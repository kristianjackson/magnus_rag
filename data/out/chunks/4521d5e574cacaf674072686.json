It’s not a bad job, really, as \nlong as you can handle the smell and the early mornings, not to mention that \nwhen winter really gets going it can be pretty unpleasant. I’ve had to chip ice \noff more than a few bins in my time, just to get them open. Still, the pay’s \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG005 – Thrown Away \n2 \n \npretty decent; at least it is once you throw in the overtime and the bonuses, \nand once you’ve done the rounds you’re usually off for the day, so you’re \nworking fewer hours than your average office monkey; it’s just that those \nhours tend to be a lot less pleasant than anything you’re likely to find staring at \nsome accounting spreadsheet. But I didn’t come here to talk about the \nbenefits and problems of working in waste collection. At least, I guess I came \nto talk about one very specific problem that I encountered last year, when \ndoing the rubbish collection for 93 Lancaster Road. \nNow, you encounter weird things in this job all the time. People have an odd \nmental block – this idea that as soon as they put something in the bin it’s gone. \nIt’s officially been made rubbish and no-one will ever see it again. The fact that \nsomeone had to take it from your bin to the landfill or the recycling centre \ndoesn’t really enter their heads, and nobody ever seems to realise that up to a \ndozen people might be seeing what you throw away before it finally disappears \nforever. But no, as far as the rest of the world thinks about it, once it’s been \nthrown away, it’s gone, far beyond all human understanding. This leaves those \nof us who work in waste collection seeing kind of a strange side to humanity, \nbut an honest one at that. If you’re a bit of a boozer, there’s every chance that \nyour bin men know how much you drink better than you do because we empty \nall the bottles. And yes, we do remember, and we also get quite judgemental \nat times, although not about the things you might think – you can throw away \na mountain of grotesque porn and, as long as you’ve tied it into neat bundles, \nwe’re fine with it, but if you throw away cat litter without properly bagging \nthat, you’d better believe that you’ve earned the hatred of every bin man that \never slung a sack. Still, I’m getting off topic.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 0, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 3055}}
