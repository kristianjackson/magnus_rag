I can’t honestly see how strapping \nyourself in to sleep or drinking your juice with a space foil pack on a straw can \nhave much effect on isolation, but I wasn’t going to be the one to bring it up. I \nbelieve some people would have been more disturbed than others by its \nlocation orbiting Earth, but it didn’t feel markedly different to me from any of \nthe other isolation studies they conducted over the last few decades. If \nanything, the silent, rolling green and blue of the Earth far below was another \nsource of comfort, in the sure knowledge of the billions of other people making \ntheir way through life who had no idea what was right above their heads. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 057 – Personal Space \n \n6 \n \nBoth of these comforts lasted me almost six weeks. That was when I was \naware I should start to experience some of the more distressing side effects. \nI’d already passed through listlessness and a bout of insomnia, and I hadn’t \nbeen using my exercise machine properly for almost a fortnight, but I still \ndidn’t expect the severity of the hallucinations when they began. Twice I was \nwoken up by the sound of the door opening, only to find it as tight as it had \never been, and throughout the daytime, I would occasionally hear footsteps, \nwhich shouldn’t even have been possible in zero gravity. There was also a \nblackout for about 20 minutes at one point that may or may not have been \nreal. Certainly, we didn’t seem to lose power in any other systems, except the \nlights. \nSo, this was all reasonably distressing, but at least it had the advantage of not \nbeing unexpected. No, the first warning I got about how bad things were going \nto get was the spacesuit. The clocks read it as 14.30 UTC and I was re-watching \n28 Days Later, one of the better films that had been provided for my \nentertainment, when a movement in the window caught my eye. At first, I \nthought it might have been some orbital debris moving past, but then I spotted \nit, still at the edge of the domed window. It was a hand. The white, bulky, \ngloved hand of someone wearing an EVA suit. \n \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 057 – Personal Space \n \n7 \n \nIt started to float slowly across the window, followed by the rest of the arm, \nthen the torso, until almost the whole suit was slowly floating across. I was \nexcited by the idea of seeing another human being at first, even if it was only \nbrief or might compromise some of the work, but as the suit made its \npainstaking drift across the space outside, it rotated enough that I could see \nclearly through the suit’s visor. There was nobody inside. The floating suit was \ncompletely empty, and I started to suddenly get very scared. \nAt last it had passed right across and off into the night the other side and I \nstopped to try and calm myself in the face of what had been a deeply strange \nthing to watch. I managed to do so, but only until I looked again out of that \nwindow. There were no more empty, floating clothes, but I noticed something \nthat for some reason hadn’t dawned on me when watching the empty suit. It \nwas, to put it quite simply, impossible, and I must have approached it from a \nhundred different angles trying to make sense of it. The Earth was gone. \nAt first, I assumed it must have been an orientation change, but that didn’t \nmake any sense. The planet below had never been hidden from my position \nbefore and if we’d shifted that radically, I would have felt it, I was sure. But \nstill, the fact remained that where the earth should have been there was \nempty, dark space. I must have watched for hours, waiting to see the sun. We \nwere definitely still moving and, from what I could tell, we still seemed to be", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 2, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 3730}}
