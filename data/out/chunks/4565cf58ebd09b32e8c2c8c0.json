He made it clear we shouldn’t \nstop if we were followed or challenged by the authorities, and we should all be \nprepared to defend the ship should anyone attempt to board or stop us. \nThe three hours I stood on the deck after they left on the little boat may well \nhave been the longest of my life. It was night, of course, and we had no lights \nshowing, nothing that would give us away. The island was completely dark as \nwell, and if it hadn’t been for the bright moon shining down on the dense trees \nand sandy beach, I might not have been able to see it at all. The \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 141 – Doomed Voyage \nsound of the boat’s engine died quickly, and I was left standing there, \nsurrounded by silence, waiting for something to happen, full of fear over what \nit was I had agreed to be part of. I longed to have a drink, to close my eyes, and \nrest for only a second, but every nerve in my body was on alert. \nWhen they returned, only two of the four crewmembers Salesa had taken \nwere still with him. \nQuestions as to what happened were met with dark looks and shaken heads. I \nfelt the rumble of the ship beneath me almost immediately, and only got the \nbriefest of glances at exactly what it was we were all risking our lives for. \nI’ve gone over that memory so many times, trying to think what I might have \nmissed, but even now, whenever I think of it, it just looked like an old camera \nwith a broken lens. And then Salesa closed and locked the metal box, and \ncarried it down into the hold as we started to sail away. \nAs he did so, I saw a flash out of the corner of my eye. I was on watch, so I \nhurried to the stern to see what was happening. There was a storm over the \nisland. I don’t know where it came from, it can’t have been more than a \nminute since I’d last looked at it, an-and the skies were completely clear. But \nnow it was covered in lightning, the rolling clouds above it dark and angry. The \nforked flashes came quickly, less than a second between them, and as the \nthunder started to hit my ears, I could see the trees of the island beginning to \ncatch fire and burn. But there was something else. \nIn the light of the flashing storm I could clearly see the waters around the \nisland, and there was something there. A huge shape, a shadow surrounding it \non all sides; getting darker, getting closer, coming up from deep, deep below \nthe surface. It must have been huge, so large that the edge of it almost \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 141 – Doomed Voyage \ntouched the ship, and had we been a few minutes slower I have no doubt \nwhatever awful thing emerged that night, it would have taken us as well. \nSomething began to break the surface as I realised the deep rumble was no \nlonger the thunder, and I closed my eyes and fell to the deck, gripping the rail \nwith all my might as a wave hit us from behind, propelling us away from it. \nWhen it had finally subsided, and I could bring myself to look back, the island \nwas gone and ocean was still. \nOur journey back was a long one, but Salesa was in a far better mood than I \nhad ever seen him. \nHis step was light, his smile was easy, and the deep circles under his eyes \nseemed to be gone. He didn’t talk about what had happened on the island, nor \nof Christoph or Adreas, the two who had not returned. When we finally arrived \nat Southampton, he insisted on throwing a ridiculous party to celebrate our \ngood fortune. The drinks flowed freely, and he walked around and shook each \nof us by the hand, telling us how much he would miss us in retirement and \nhiding his insincerity well. I do not believe there was a sober person on the \nDorian when the night was over, and we slept easily. Well, the others slept \neasily, but they had not seen what I had seen. \nI didn’t hear the explosion myself. Dantez told me about it, as it had apparently \nwoken him and a few others of the crew. A big explosion, they said, further \ninto the port. We staggered onto the deck and, sure enough, smoke could be \nseen a little way off, its source hidden behind a wall of shipping containers. \nThere was no reason at that point to suspect it had anything to do with us, but \nI think somehow we all knew what it meant. That something had gone terribly \nwrong.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 3, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 4352}}
