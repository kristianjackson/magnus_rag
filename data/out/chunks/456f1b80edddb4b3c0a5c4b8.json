I was in a really bad \nplace. \nThen a friend recommended a meditation course to me. I thought I’d give it a \nshot. Obviously the meditation course didn’t mention anything about the \norganization behind it. I had no idea it was anything other than a standard \nevening class, and it had exactly the right level of pseudo-mystical nonsense to it \nto get me comfortable. A little bit of tarot imagery here, some misinterpretation \nof chakras there, a touch of sweet-smelling incense to tie it all together and you \nhave a meditation class that is exactly my level. I mean, let’s put it like this - I \ndon’t believe in the power of crystals but I still have plenty dotted around my \nbedroom. I don’t believe in astrology but I do have my birth chart on my wall, and \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 153 – Love Bombing \n4 \n \nlike to check my horoscope, sun sign and ascendant every day. Just for fun, of \ncourse. \nAnyway, the meditation part of it was actually really good. I’d never had much \nluck silencing my mind, but Joyce - the lady running it - was really good at bringing \nyou to that space. It was surprisingly freeing. I started attending regularly. One \nthing she insisted on was the start of each session, we would all sit in a circle and \ntell the others what we liked about each other. Only compliments, only truth. The \nfirst few sessions, no one really knew the others well enough to offer anything \nmore than general niceties, but as it went on and we became closer the \naffirmations became more personal. More meaningful. And it felt really good just \nto have all that positivity, that affection uncritically directed at you. I thought it \nwould be cheesy, but it was just this incredible feeling of being wanted and \nappreciated. \nYou know, every comedian goes on about how they love the business, how great \neveryone is. Every one of them is lying. It’s horrible and everyone in it is horrible, \nand being there, having people be genuinely lovely to me, I didn’t \nknow what to do with those feelings. Apparently in organizations that monitor \ncults, this method is called love bombing. I think I’d even heard of it somewhere \nbefore, but that didn’t make it any less effective. \nI went to the meditation group for about three months, before Joyce mentioned a \nspiritual retreat she wanted us all to go on. It was in America, \na small community out in rural Arkansas, and all our expenses would be taken \ncare of. That should have sent alarm bells ringing, but by that point I trusted her \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 153 – Love Bombing \n5 \n \nso implicitly that I was just excited I wouldn’t have to buy my own ticket. I won’t \nbore you with the details of the rest of my indoctrination, once I got to the Divine \nChains community - or compound, to use the classic term, though there weren’t \nany fences or watchtowers. Suffice to say that there was more friendliness, \nsupport, meditation, and you know what? Really good food. I’m told that Arnold \nused to be a chef before they recruited him and well very much helped their \ncause. \nI also met the leader of the organization, Claude Vilakazi, and he was so nice. \nPeople talk about charismatic dictators or cults of personality, but honestly you \ndon’t even know what charisma is until you meet someone like Claude. \nEverything you say is valid and important, you are always worthy of his time, and \nyou know what? Deep down, you just think the same way. I mean, even now, \nafter everything I still miss listening to him talk. \nThe Divine Chains philosophy was pretty simple. Throughout history there have \nbeen ten great links, holy figures of divine wisdom who were the manifested will \nof humanity to understand and better itself. All the heavy hitters you’d expect on \nthe list: Buddha, Jesus, Muhammad, Ramakrishna - you get the idea. They weren’t \nreincarnations, per se, but the same divine impulse for human elevation \nmanifested in different people. Claude Vilakazi was definitely not claiming to be \nthe Eleventh Link, oh no. But he had had a vision that the Eleventh was soon to be \nborn, and that he was to be their herald and guardian. The actual practices were a \ngrab bag of all sorts of occultism, exactly what you’d expect from a group who laid \nclaim to basically every major religion.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 1, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 4263}}
