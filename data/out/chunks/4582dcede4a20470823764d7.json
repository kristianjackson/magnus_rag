I mean, a first from Corpus \nChristi, Cambridge, a masters in Biological Sciences – you’d think that would be \nenough to get a decent science job. But as it turns out, the competition these \ndays is legitimately ridiculous, and trying to get a position based on my \nacademic record seemed to be a complete waste of time. Then I applied to the \nAnglo Brazilian Amazon Trust, and do you know what actually got me the job? I \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 149 – Concrete Jungle \n2 \n \nhad a half blue in modern pentathlon and another in orienteering from my \nundergrad days. Apparently, most of the science positions were generally \napplied to by the sort of people who pursued academia specifically to avoid \never having to climb up a hill, and the job required a certain degree of \noutdoorsmanship. It didn’t even matter that I didn’t speak Portuguese (well, \nnot back then). It was enough that I had the knowledge, fitness and, most \nimportantly, was willing to basically chuck in my entire life in England with no \nnotice to fly off to Brazil for who knows how long. Strange how things work out \nsometimes, isn’t it? \nThe job title was technically Ecological Specimen Technician, but working with \nthe ABAT was basically nothing like any lab tech job I’d ever had before. For a \nstart, there wasn’t a lab, not really. They’d built this facility just on the edge of \nthe Caracaraí Ecological Station and, from a distance, you’d think it was just \nthis big wooden hut, and it kind of was, just full of incredibly high-tech kit. \nThere was basically no testing done on site, though. Aside from the computers, \nthe visiting researchers used to just make whatever notes or observations, or \nrun whatever models, they needed. Basically, everything on-site was designed \nfor quick storage and processing any specimens for travel. Keeping a lab \nenvironment up and running in the middle of the Amazon was never really an \noption, so most of our job was focused on retrieving whatever they wanted \ntesting and making sure that it got to the actual lab intact, wherever that might \nhave been. \nI was part of the facility's permanent staff, and we were generally hired out by \ncorporations or universities who wanted to use our services for some project \nor piece of research they were conducting. My specific job was to head out \ninto the jungle, usually babysitting some weedy wannabe explorers who", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 0, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 2958}}
