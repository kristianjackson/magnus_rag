He'd be \ncoming down alone on a solo parachute. It all started well enough, the flight up \nwas fine and the old man, who said his name was Simon, appeared to be \nhaving a great time, making jokes and quite frankly a lot more eager to throw \nhimself out of a plane than almost anyone Robert had ever met before. \nFinally the climb finished and the door was opened to the rush of air. Harriet \nFairchild, the instructor, readied herself to jump, with Simon strapped to her \nchest. It was at this moment, Robert said, that the old man turned to him, \nshouting something. He didn’t hear it clearly, but thought it had been “enjoy \nsky blue”. He’d felt dizzy all of a sudden, almost falling to the floor as Harriet \nhurled herself and her passenger out of the plane. It passed in a moment, \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG021 – Freefall \n5 \n \nthough, and he pushed himself out of the door, and was greeted by that \nfamiliar plunging feeling in his stomach as he began his freefall. \nHe knew something was wrong almost immediately. He was jumping, he said, \nfrom about ten thousand feet, so should have been falling for almost thirty \nseconds before opening his parachute, but he was having trouble keeping \ncount. The clear blue sky was so bright it seemed to blind him, and the \nnumbers were all jumbled in his head. His balance seemed to be all turned \naround and he said he had had to shut his eyes tight against the brightness, \nconcentrating to keep his count. Finally, he reached what he thought was thirty \nseconds, and went to pull his ripcord, but as he did, he said, he opened his \neyes again and froze. The ground was gone. \nI asked him what he meant, had he got turned around, maybe. He just shook \nhis head, and told me again that the ground had gone. All that there was, he \nsaid, was that vast, empty blue sky, stretching off before him, but still he was \nfalling into it. It was bright, he kept saying, it was so bright, although there was \nno sun in that sky and no clouds for it to hide behind. Just the empty, blue sky \nin all directions as he fell into it. He wanted to pull the ripcord, to unfurl his \nparachute, but his hand wouldn't close over the grip. So he just fell. \nRobert was shaking badly at this point, so I got him a blanket and made him \nanother cup of tea. I wasn't sure I believed all what he was saying, but he'd \ncertainly been through something dreadful; I could see that. I asked him how \nlong he'd been falling like that, and he said he didn't know. His watch had \nstopped, but it had felt like hours. Days even. He had been so hungry, he said, \nbut had just kept falling. He didn't know which direction; there was just that \nempty sky all around, so it was impossible to tell.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 2, "chunk_count": 5, "chars": 2744}}
