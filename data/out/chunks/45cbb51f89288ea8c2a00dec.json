To be \nhonest, I didn’t believe him. Even if a gorilla’s hide could be preserved for more \nthan two millennia, it seemed an unlikely thing to be found in the back of a \nshop in Barnet. It was clearly very old though and I didn’t challenge him on it. \nI was just about to make my excuses and go, when the bell rang out at the \nfront of the shop and a pair of obnoxious Cockney voices started to call out for \nDaniel. His face went blank at this and he asked me to excuse him one second, \nabruptly leaving me in the back room alone. I heard the men say something \nabout unloading a van and then the bell rang again, taking Daniel with it. I was \nalone. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 054 – Still Life \n10 \n \nI was just packing up and making some final notes for my report when I heard \nsomething. It was muffled, but definitely seemed to be words. It sounded like \nit was coming from beneath the floor. \nI looked and saw a ring-pull connected to a small door I hadn’t noticed, which I \nassumed led to a basement. The sound came again. \nI cast a look into the main shop to see if Daniel had returned, but it was quiet. I \nknew opening the door was a stupid thing to do. I can’t imagine a single \nscenario where it would have ended well for me, but the whole place was so \nstrange that part of me couldn’t resist seeing how deep the rabbit hole went, if \nyou’ll pardon the joke. So I opened the door. \nIt did indeed have a flight of stairs disappearing down into what seemed to be \na basement. If there was a light switch, I couldn’t see it, and it was impossible \nto see anything beyond the first dozen steps or so. The light that filtered \nthrough from the dim bulb behind me did illuminate one thing though: a face. I \ncouldn’t make out any details, but it was pale and swayed ever so slightly from \nside to side. The body below it was shadowed and hidden, but it seemed to \nstare up at me as it moved. It spoke, the cadence identical to what I had heard \nthrough the wooden door. \n“We’ve got one down here. Come on, I’ll show you.” \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 054 – Still Life \n11 \n \nIt was so flat, almost mechanical, it felt about as much like genuine speech as \nthe wind flowing through a cracked rock sounds like a flute being played. \nWhich is to say, they may sound identical, but only one of them is made by a \nliving human. I started to say something, to call out, but my voice died in my \nthroat slightly as the face retreated back into the basement. \n“We’ve got one down here. Come on, I’ll show you.” \nI turned and walked very briskly into the main shop. I was now fully terrified \nand could feel the cold sweat dripping off my forehead. In the doorway stood \nDaniel. He asked if I was all right with a smile that made my stomach drop and \nat last he looked me in the eyes. I recognised the glassy stare. The same eyes \nthat gazed at me from a hundred sawdust filled sockets around the room. \nWhen they all began to move, I nearly broke down. If I had, I have no doubt \nthat I would be dead. Or maybe far worse. Instead, I had a sudden rush of \nadrenaline and charged into Daniel, knocking him sprawling to the floor in \nsurprise. It was like hitting a sandbag. His two Cockney friends were too slow \nto grab me before I was off down the road. I may not look like it, but I can \nmove at a fair pace when I need to. And I did so for almost an hour before I \nfinally felt safe enough to stop.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 4, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 3455}}
