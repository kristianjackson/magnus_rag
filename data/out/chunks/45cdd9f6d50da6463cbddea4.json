They clearly had enough on their minds, eyes \nnarrowed against the glare and mouths pressed tight. We didn’t talk about the \nwar. There was no question I could have asked that did not risk breaking the \nfragile solidarity of our small band, but as I walked alongside them, I knew that \neach of them was dwelling on ghosts and stories of their own. \nThe first sign we saw of our quarry was a thin column of smoke ahead of us, \nclear against the deep blue sky. It was a mountain cabin, not uncommon in \nthese parts, with a well-built chimney stack gently announcing its warmth. In \n\nfront of the door sat a woman with coarse, dark hair, built almost as solidly as \nthe chimney, and quietly mending a thick, woollen shirt. As we approached she \nlooked up and we saw, in the middle of her throat, a ragged bullet hole. Her \neyes were cloudy and unfocused as she got to her feet and began to walk \ntowards us, blood still trickling from her throat. \nI heard a scream, and it was so hoarse and inhuman I assumed for a moment it \nmust have come from this half-dead thing with its ruined throat. But it was \nAntonio. His face was ashen, and for a second it seemed he was about to drop \nhis weapon and run, but instead he barrelled past me, tackling the woman to \nground. There was an awful snapping sound, but her limbs still moved and \nflailed weakly as Antonio stood, and began to stomp down with all his weight. \nThe others joined in, shouting or screaming, kicking and beating until the \ncorpse was still. I was the only one left standing at the side, staring down at the \nbeaten and bloody mess of... something. None of us said a word. \nThe silence lasted for about four seconds. Then there was the gunshot. It \nechoed around the mountain for far longer than it had any right to. We \nscattered immediately, instincts triggering to find cover. Too late for poor \nAlfredo, a small man whose sister I had once courted long ago. He remained \nstood exactly where he’d been when the bullet went clean through his skull. It \nwas almost five minutes before he finally collapsed, but we watched for far \nlonger to see if he got up again. He didn’t. \nThat was the turning point. Not the dark-haired spectre of death, but that \nsudden, unseen death. \nUncaring savagery that could be neither foreseen nor avoided, only awaited. \nFrom that moment the mountain was no longer the place where we hunted. \n\nBut neither was it somewhere we were prey. It was simply the place we were \ngoing to die. \nWe continued like this for several days. We saw no other signs of life, or \nwhatever passed for it up there on the mountain. The only indication we saw \nthat we weren’t utterly alone would be the periodic sound of a gunshot, as \nanother of our number fell. The stark terror was evident on every face, but \nnone of us even considered turning back. Something in us just knew that we \nwere far beyond anything we could control, and if we were leaving this \nmountain alive, it would not be through our own decision. \nBy the time we found the cave, it was only myself, Antonio, and a young lad \nfrom the village, who should not have joined us in the first place. I never \nlearned his name, but he’d been a drummer in the fanfara, or so he said. \nJudging by how he held his rifle, I believed him. I would have laughed, told him \nhe would have fared better with his drumsticks, but the joke died on my lips. \nThe smell that came from that cave was far beyond anything I had experienced \nin the war. The jagged hole into the cliff face oozed bitter, icy cold, and to call \nit the smell of death would miss the point of it entirely. It was the smell of our \ndeath. Antonio turned to me without a word, gripped my hand in his, and \nkissed me once on the forehead. Then he walked to edge of the cliff and hurled \nhimself over the edge. I didn’t look down after him. Truth be told, I envied him \nhis resolve. \nI walked into the cave. The drummer boy might have followed after me, or he \nmight have joined Antonio. I never turned around; he was the last thing on my \nmind. The cave was a long way from natural, forming a smooth but uneven \ntunnel heading deep into the mountain. It narrowed slightly as I descended,", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 2, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 4301}}
