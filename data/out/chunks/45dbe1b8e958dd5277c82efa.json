Um, so were walking, walking along just – er, Jackie just loves to \nrun off the lash and just run, scour around the fields and— \nBASIRA \nOkay. So you were walking, a couple of weeks ago— \nROBIN \nEr, that’s right, yes. \nBASIRA \n—it was about noon— \nROBIN \nIn the South Downs, yes. \nBASIRA \n—yes, in the South Downs. \nROBIN \nAnd… off in the distance, something just caught my, something just caught my \neye, and I, I have pretty good eyesight. I, er, I had them… had, had an eye test a \nfew days ago— \nBASIRA \nYes. \nROBIN \n\nY’know, one of those free ones that you get, you go along just for the sake of \nit— \nBASIRA \nWhat… What did you see? \nROBIN \nOkay, right, so, I, I thought to myself that, that stone circle, that wasn’t there \nbefore. At least, I thought it was a cir— a stone circle. So, so, me and Jackie \nwent off to investigate – Jackie’s quite a curious dog. Um, it’s quite a normal \nthing for Jack, er, Jack Russell terriers to be curious animals— \nBASIRA \nSo you went to investigate that? \nROBIN \nRight, yes. So, so, we, we were, we were walking towards this, er, this, what I \nthought was a stone circle. So, I was, sort of, walking towards it, and I, I really \nnoticed it got, it got quite a lot chillier. \nSo it was quite a sunny day— \nBASIRA \nOkay \nROBIN \n—erm, I hadn’t, I hadn’t taken a jacket. Y’know when you sort of look out the \nwindow and you’re like ‘Today’s a jacket day’— \n\nBASIRA \nSo you thought… you saw this stone circle? \nROBIN \nOh yes, yeah. \nBASIRA \nStarted walking towards it? \nROBIN \nThat’s right. \nBASIRA \nAnd then..? \nROBIN \nOkay, so, so, yeah, it’s like I said, it was definitely, definitely a bit, definitely a \nbit chillier. Um, I don’t think there was any wind or anything that day, but it, \nyeah, just sort of, as I was walking towards it, felt, felt the chill. And I felt \nJackie, sort of, start to walk closer to me. She started to run off a lot less, as if \nshe sort of – I don’t know, maybe I just sort of noticed th— y’know when you \nsort of get a feeling for what mood a dog’s in, um, when you sort of spend a lot \nof time around them— \nBASIRA \nSo, what about this stone circle? \nROBIN \n\nOh, the stone circle. So, so, I got closer, and I realised that, although I hadn’t \nseen, I hadn’t seen the stone circle before, but the, the, sort of texture of the \nrocks and, maybe a bit of, er, I dunno, they looked quite old. They, they \ndefinitely looked like they had been there for a long time, but that they, but I \nrecall them definitely not being there, ‘cause, ‘cause, I’ve taken that route \nmaybe five or six or… (mumbles) a few times now. When was the first time I \ntook that route? I think that was with— \nBASIRA \nSo you don’t remember seeing this before, but the rocks looked old? \nROBIN \nLet me start again. \n[Tape clicks off. Tape clicks on.] \nMELANIE \nAlright then. Statement of… Brian… er… ‘Fentinson’? \n(Brian stammers significantly throughout. He and Melanie’s dialogue often \noverlaps.) \nBRIAN \nOh, um, it’s, it’s, it’s… it’s Fin- Finlinson. \nMELANIE \nAh, right, sorry. That’s the… the handwriting here. So. Statement regarding… \nBRIAN \n\nSp-Spiders. B-B-But, I mean, lot, a lot of spiders! \nMELANIE \nAh. Good. A spider one. \nBRIAN \nWhat? \nMELANIE \nDate: May 26th. And, er, go on… ah, let’s, let’s get this over with. \nBRIAN \n(Confused) Is… Look, is everything okay? \nMELANIE \n \n(Sighs) Yes. Yes, it’s, it’s fine. Sorry, I just, I just don’t hold out a lot of hope \nfor… coherence. \nBRIAN \nWhat? \nMELANIE \nOur Archivist is on leave. \nBRIAN \nI don’t really. Look.
