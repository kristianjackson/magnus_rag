It’s hard to say exactly when \nwe first met or even started talking, as we were taking a class together at the \ntime. I’m sure there was plenty of discussion or interaction before we learned \neach other’s names, but I started my course in September of 2005, so yeah, \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG003 – Across The Street \n2 \n \nabout two years. I had decided to take a Criminology course at Birkbeck \nUniversity as a way of getting out of the rut with my office job – I’m an \nAssociate Compliance Analyst at Deloitte, and if you think that sounds boring, \nwell… yeah. It is. I knew a night course in Criminology wasn’t going to go \nanywhere, of course, even if I’d finished it. I just had to do something to find a \nbit of interest in my life, and it was either that or become an alcoholic, so… \nSorry, I’m going off topic. I initially found Graham a bit off-putting, to be \nhonest. He was a chain smoker and wore far too much deodorant to try and \ncover the smell. He was a bit older than me, maybe ten years or so. I never \nasked his age, I mean, we weren’t that close, but he was starting to grey at the \nedges of his hair, and you could see that the tiredness on his face wasn’t just \nfrom missing a single night’s sleep. That’s not to say he was bad looking – he \nhad a round, open sort of face and quite deep blue eyes, but very much not my \ntype. He was well-spoken in group work, at least when he did speak, and I \nthink it came up once that he’d been to Oxford, though I don’t know what \ncollege. \nI’d noticed earlier that during lectures he always seemed to be scribbling \nfuriously in a notebook even when the lecturer wasn’t speaking. At first I just \nthought he was thorough, but I swear I watched him fill a whole A5 notebook \nin one lecture. I remember it was a talk on youth and the justice system where \nthe speaker was so slow that it wouldn’t have filled that book even if Graham \nhad been writing down literally every word. Not to mention I asked to borrow \nhis notes once for an essay, and he gave me this weird look and said he didn’t \ntake any notes. \nSo yeah, point is, I wouldn’t have called him a friend, but we got on alright. It \nwas about four months into my course that I first encountered Graham outside", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 0, "chunk_count": 9, "chars": 3084}}
