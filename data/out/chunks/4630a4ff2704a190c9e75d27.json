I tried to have a couple more viewings \nin that time, but the stain on the ceiling was becoming more obvious, and the \nsmell had begun to pervade my whole flat, to the point where I was thinking \nabout staying in a hotel until the plumber arrived. I was starting to doubt it was \na leaking water pipe. As it grew, it started to turn a dark yellow in colour and \nglistened ever so slightly when the light hit it. I knew it was something to do \nwith the flat upstairs, though when I went up to ask this time, my knocking \nwent unanswered. \nFinally the plumber arrived. He wrinkled his nose when he entered, though \ndidn't make any comment about it. I assume unpleasant smells are just a part \nof his job. I pointed him towards the stain on the ceiling and he looked \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG018 – The Man Upstairs \n8 \n \nmomentarily confused, before telling me what I already knew – that this didn't \nlook like a problem with the pipes. Still, he said he'd need to knock through the \nceiling to have a look, and I'd need a contractor to come and redo that bit of \nceiling anyway. I stood back when he put up his stepladder and climbed up to \nhave a look at it. He put on a pair of rubber gloves and gingerly touched the \nspot, testing it with his fingers. It collapsed almost immediately, buckling and \ntearing like wet cardboard, and the fluid that oozed out of it was a sickly yellow \nin colour, with viscous white lumps glistening in it. The plumber looked like he \nwas going to throw up. I did throw up. He made his apologies, and said he'd \nhave to call someone. I didn't try to stop him leaving. \nI was furious, and the anger that surged through me overcame any \napprehension I might have felt from approaching the flat upstairs. I stormed up \nand began to hammer on the door, shouting and threatening that I'd call the \npolice if he didn't answer. On my third knock the door swung inwards ever so \nslightly, and I realised it was not locked. There is… little in my life that I regret \nquite as much as going inside. \nI pushed the door open as much as I could but it didn't open very wide, as \nthere seemed to be some sort of resistance behind it. The smell would have \nbeen overpowering, but by this point I was almost used to it, and fought down \nthe nausea. There was no light coming from inside, and I fumbled on the wall \nfor a switch. I found it, and the instant before I flicked it on, I realised I felt \nsomething soft and wet on the wall next to it. Unfortunately, before I had a \nchance to fully comprehend what I was feeling, I had turned on the light and \nsaw Toby Carlisle's flat in its entirety. \nThe light that came on was weak and tinged with red, but it was enough to see \nby.
