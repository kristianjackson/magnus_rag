But I know longer think of \nsuch things. \nThe core of their hatred was for anything they saw as ‘unnatural’. To them, \nGod’s creation was perfect, and all things in nature were right and proper \naccording to His will. Of course, there was little consistency in what they \nconsidered to be ‘natural’, and it always seemed to fall along the lines of their \nown petty jealousies and pride. Anything they did not understand became \nunnatural, and I found myself crossing that line from an early age, although \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 135 – Dark Matter \n \n3 \n \nstrangely, out of everything I was, it was always my desire to pursue a scientific \ncareer that they railed against with the most energy. I saw it as studying the \nnatural world, learning how it worked, mapping it. They saw it as devil-inspired \npride that tried to know and master forces that were rightfully beyond us. \nRegardless, I broke with them as soon as I could, and only returned when they \nwere dying. Did I come to gloat? Maybe. Though more than that, I wanted to \ntell them of my own Church, to spread the Gospel that I had found, so that \nthey might die with the fear of darkness on their lips. \nYou see, I do not disagree with my parents’ thesis that the true virtue of the \nworld is in its natural state. But the natural state of the universe is darkness. \nThose rank, pompous balls of fire and light, vomiting their radiation out into \nthe nothing, they cannot stand against the overwhelming reality of it. We talk \nabout light and dark being opposites, but they are no more opposites than a \ngaudy paint is the opposite of the wall upon which it sits. Without light, there is \ndarkness, but without darkness, there is nothing. We sit upon our tiny spinning \nball of dirt, desperately building our own tiny suns, our own illuminating \nshelters, from the truth of existence, clustering around them like insects, never \nrealising that they rob us of the revelations that come in the dark, that our \nwretched eyes bind us to this grotesque world in which we live. \nBut Manuela, they would say, all life comes from light, the energy that sustains \nus is drawn from the sun, from its warm, beautiful radiance. And I tell them to \nlook again at ‘life’, at the pain and suffering and misery that it brings with it. \nThe nature that light gives us is corrupt and base, tearing itself to pieces, \nspinning to its own sick destruction. The life that is given to us by the stars, by \nthe sun, can barely sustain itself for a century.
