I kept taking those old familiar turnings, moving \ninevitably towards that sick, old building. When I arrived, it was quiet. The \nwhole building looked filthy now, even from the outside, and the plants that \nbordered it had started to take on an unhealthy whitish colour. There was one \nother car in the parking area, a faded white Transit van I didn’t recognise. I got \nout and started to walk towards the front door. The smell was noticeable even \nfrom out here, and by the time I got close enough to reach the buzzer, it had \nbecome so strong as to be unbearable. I tried to bring myself to press the \nbutton. But instead I turned and half-sprinted back to my car, desperate to \nbreath clean air again. \nI stood there, torn between wanting to flee and needing to know. Then in the \nsilence, I heard it. Tap, tap, tap. Someone banging rhythmically on a window. I \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG036 – Taken Ill \n11 \n \nscanned all the ones I could see, but they were dark. Tap, tap, tap. It showed \nno sign of stopping. I began to make a wide circuit of the building. It was on the \nother side that I saw it. A large, ground floor window showed what I think \nwould once have been the lounge. The walls were dark, stained and smeared \nto almost black, but the windows were clear. Stood the other side of the glass, \nweakly banging her fist against it, was Alenka Kozel. Her skin was mottled, \ncovered with that leaking yellow rash. She saw me, and as her eyes locked with \nmine she opened her mouth, and the buzzing of the flies that spewed out was \nalmost as loud as her scream. \nI turned and began to sprint back towards my car. I had to get away, to get out. \nThen, without warning, I felt something heavy hit me in the side and I lost my \nfooting, falling to the ground. I looked up to see an old man pinning me to the \nground, his long, white beard matted and filthy. I screamed and tried to \nescape, but his age seemed to have done nothing to diminish his strength, and \nhe kept his grip easily. \nThen he spoke in a thick Mancunian accent and told me to keep my voice \ndown. I noticed that his skin was unblemished pink, and behind him stood a \nyoung woman, tall and lean with closecropped hair and a deep scar over her \nright eye. She carried a large canvas bag, and was shaking her head, telling the \nold man to leave me alone. After a few suspicious glances, he got up. I could \nswear I recognised him from somewhere, but when I asked the two of them \nwho they were, they just shook their heads and told me to leave. I asked them \nwhat was going on, and the old man looked at his companion, as if asking \npermission, said something about knowledge being a good defence here. She \nshook her head and said that leaving quickly was a better one. I didn’t need to \nbe told a third time.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 5, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 2788}}
