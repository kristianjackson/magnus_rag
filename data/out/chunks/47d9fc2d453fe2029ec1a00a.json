I tried to call his phone so many times, but \nwhenever it actually connected, all I heard was the sound of rushing wind. \nI know that man with the scar took my brother. I don’t know how he took him, \nor where, but I know he’s gone. I haven’t seen either of them since, and I don’t \nthink I will. It never felt like I was what he wanted. I really hope Grant is dead. \nBecause, if not, I have a horrible feeling deep inside that he’s still on that \nladder. \nARCHIVIST \nStatement ends. \nMichael Crew. The man with the lightning scar. A fractal pattern burned into \nhis flesh, chased by the manifestation of that pattern and then jumped out a \nwindow. So what is he now? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG075 – A Long Way Down \n11 \n \nIt strikes me that whenever a person gains any sort of power from these books, \noften they change, not just their actions, but who they are. It almost seems as \nthough the power uses them, rather than the other way round. Did Leitner’s \nbook do something to Michael Crew? Others who encountered it reported \nsimilar feelings of vertigo to those reported by Mr. Walker, but it also puts me \nin mind of the fate of Robert Kelly, the skydiver who fell for far longer than \nhe... \n[The door to the office opens] \nHello? Basira, what are you doing here? I thought... \nBASIRA \nHere. \n[A box is put on the table] \nARCHIVIST \nAre those the tapes? \nBASIRA \nAs many of them as I could get. \nARCHIVIST \nI don’t understand. You said we were done. \nBASIRA \n(Exasperated) They’re covering it up. Altman’s death. Saying he was dirty. That \nhe got stabbed in a botched drug deal. \nARCHIVIST \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG075 – A Long Way Down \n12 \n \nWait. So the operation you went on... \nBASIRA \nDoesn’t exist. I mean, I didn’t know Leo well, but... it’s not right. And they \nseemed happy enough to get me out the door. \nARCHIVIST \nI still don’t understand why this leads to me getting the tapes. I mean, not that \nI’m ungrateful. \nBASIRA \nWell they're sure as hell not going to solve Gertrude’s murder, so you might as \nwell have them. \nBefore... I don’t know, maybe I still had enough police in me not to just steal \nfrom Evidence, but now... \nARCHIVIST \nThey’ve rather lost your loyalty. I thought they were watching you? \nBASIRA \nNo, not since the Brodie op. Everyone’s been too busy. Daisy knows, and she’s \nfine with it. There shouldn’t be any problem until next inventory, and even \nthen it’s only if they can be bothered with the sectioned stuff. You should be in \nthe clear. \nARCHIVIST \nI... I don’t know how to thank you. \nBASIRA \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG075 – A Long Way Down \n13 \n \nWell, if I never see you again, or hear about any of this... that’ll be thanks \nenough. Take care. \n[Basira leaves and the door closes] \nARCHIVIST \nRight. I wonder where to start... \n[Tape clicks off.] \nThe Magnus Archives is a podcast distributed by Rusty Quill and licensed under \na Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Sharealike 4.0 International \nlicence. \nToday’s episode was written by Jonathan Sims and directed by Alexander J \nNewall.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 5, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 3084}}
