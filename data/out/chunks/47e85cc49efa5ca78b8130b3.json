About spiders. Huh. Glad John didn’t have to read this one \nanyway; I know he’s not a fan. Although this one wasn’t too bad, actually, I— \nAh, anyway. \n \nThis is, I suppose, one explanation for the disappearance of Dexter Banks, \nalong with almost a hundred cast members, back in 2012. There’s not a lot I \ncan really add that hasn’t already been dissected by a hundred different \ntabloids, magazines and mystery shows. Even the, um, arachnid angle has been \ncovered, as it seems that when we weren’t a lot of help, Alexia Crawley told \nher full story to the press. She was not treated kindly and refuses to discuss the \nevents any further. Poor thing. \n \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG110 – Creature Feature \n \n13 \n \nAh, but Basira did manage to get hold of a few things from recent LAPD files \nthat haven’t been released to the public yet, though she’s a bit cagey as to how \nshe got them. Apparently, over the last five years, every February, a corpse is \nfound washed up on Redondo Beach. It’ll be a shrivelled husk, with all \nmoisture and internal organs apparently removed. These corpses are usually \nunidentifiable, but the one that washed up last year was confirmed to be \nChadwick Fraiser – an aspiring actor who went missing in 2012, and whose \nIMDB page lists a final credit for Widow’s Weave. \n \nUm, that’s it. \n \n(Click) \n \n(Click) \n \nMARTIN \nThat doesn’t make sense; can he even do that? \n \nBASIRA \nI don’t know, I guess so? \n \nMARTIN \nI mean, so what, he can just reach into your head and put something in there? \n \nBASIRA \nI don’t know. I guess so. \n \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG110 – Creature Feature \n \n14 \n \nMARTIN \nI mean, does it even have to be a true thing? Do, do we know for sure he’s not \nlying, like, like, magically lying? \n \nBASIRA \nI. Don’t. Know. \n \nMARTIN \nR-right, sorry. I’m just... It’s a lot to take in, you know? \n \nBASIRA \n(Sharply) Mostly for Melanie, yeah. \n \nMARTIN \nOh, of course, yes. Sorry. \n \nBASIRA \nLook, I’m not the one you need— [Sighing] We can’t just ignore it. \n \nMARTIN \nWell yeah, but what do we— We didn’t even know that was something he \ncould do. What if there’s other stuff he could do to us? \n \nBASIRA \nWe are not letting him get away with it. \n \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG110 – Creature Feature \n \n15 \n \nMARTIN \nI didn’t say that. \n \nBASIRA \nLook, Martin, I know you care. I know you do. But caring isn’t enough. You \ncan’t just stand next to someone with a cup of tea and hope everything’s going \nto be alright. \n \nMARTIN \nThat’s not fair. You don’t even know me. \n \nBASIRA \nProve it. We need to do something, because if we just let him— \n \nMARTIN \nOh! Hi, hey, hey Melanie. I, I— Can I get you a... cup of tea? \n \nMELANIE \nSo she told you, then. \n \nBASIRA \nWe need everyone if we’re going to have any chance. \n \nMELANIE \nRight. \n \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG110 – Creature Feature \n \n16 \n \nMARTIN \nWhat about Tim? \n \nBASIRA \nTim is... Elias is watching him too closely. \n \nMELANIE \nHe’s probably watching me too. \n \nMARTIN \nWe could try the tunnels. John says they might help? \n \nMELANIE \nRight. \n \nBASIRA \nOr maybe when he’s not paying attention, distracted, like during your, um, \n‘performance review’? \n \nMELANIE \nWait, what do you mean? \n \nMARTIN \nYeah, what? \n \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG110 – Creature Feature \n \n17 \n \nBASIRA \nWell, I was heading out, and Martin, you remember you knocked over that \nhuge stack of papers? \n \nMARTIN \nThey shouldn’t have been there in the first place! Besides, I cleaned them up. \n \nBASIRA \nBut not in the right order. And when I brought them up to Elias yesterday, he \nasked why they were messed up. \n \nMARTIN \n(Slightly alarmed) Y-you didn’t tell him it was me? \n \nBASIRA \nNot the point, Martin. The point is— \n \nMELANIE \nHe wasn’t watching you. He was busy. \n \nBASIRA \nYeah. \n \nMARTIN \nHang on...", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 6, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 3838}}
