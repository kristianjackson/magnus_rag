I am. \nMARTIN \nWhy?! \nARCHIVIST \nYou know why. I can’t let them out. \n(Martin sobs) \nI can’t! Not again. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 200 – Last Words \n17 \nMARTIN \nOh, what have you done, John! \nARCHIVIST \nGo tell the others. It’s over. \nMARTIN \nN-No… you don’t understand! \nARCHIVIST \nWhat? \nMARTIN \nI’m sorry, John. I’m, I’m so sorry... I, I saw you had gone and… and I knew that \nyou-you couldn’t help yourself. You never could! I knew you’d lied to me, that \nyou were going in alone... \nARCHIVIST \nMartin? What did you do? \nMARTIN \n(Shaking) I told them to go early. To do it straight away and... I’d keep you \ntalking. Until they were done. \nARCHIVIST \n(Calm) Oh Martin. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 200 – Last Words \n18 \nMARTIN \nI didn’t think you’d go through with it! Not without me! I can’t believe you’d do \nthis! That you’d leave me like this! You swore to me! You swore to me, you \nbastard! \nARCHIVIST \nMartin! I’m still here. \nMARTIN \nAre you!? How much of you is even left now? \nARCHIVIST \nIt’s still me, Martin. I’m still here. \nMARTIN \nHow would you even know? \nARCHIVIST \n…I’m sorry Martin, I am, but it’s done. You can hate me, you can scream at me, \nbut it won’t change anything. I had to do this. And you promised. \nMARTIN \n(Angry trembling) Don’t you dare say that. Don’t you dare! \nARCHIVIST \n(Calm) I’m sorry. We can still be together, here. Until it’s over. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 200 – Last Words \n19 \nMARTIN \nYou’re not listening! You never listen! They are down there fighting those \nthings and lighting it right now! \nARCHIVIST \nIt’s fine, Martin, I’ll call off the servitors. \nThey can’t light it if they don’t have… they don’t... \n[Pats clothing] \n[Hissing static start] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nW-wait a— \nOh… Oh no. \n[Hissing static ends] \n[A high-pitched wave of ringing then an enormous, distant \nexplosion, and the creaking of distressed metal] \n(The Archivist screams in distorted agony) \nMARTIN \nJohn! \nARCHIVIST \nMartin, I— AH! AH! \nMARTIN \nJohn, we have to get out of here! \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 200 – Last Words \n20 \nARCHIVIST \n(Gasping) I… I can’t. Martin, I’m part of this place. \n[Static distortions and crumbling building, creaking distressed \nmetal] \n(The Archivist winces in pain) \nMARTIN \nGoddamn it, John! \n[Another wave of distant destruction] \nARCHIVIST \n(Enduring) Aaaaaaargh! \nI can… withstand it. I just need to hold... on... \n[A closer, clear explosion resounds] \nMARTIN \n(Gritted teeth) Come on, John! Come on! \n[Sound of tapes rewinding; building in distress; static screeching] \nARCHIVIST \n(Struggling) No! I can feel the pull… The Web, the tapes, it wants— \nNo! I won’t let it! \nMARTIN \nFor god’s sake, John, move! \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 200 – Last Words \n21 \nARCHIVIST \nI can’t! \nMartin get out of here! \n[A nearby collapse] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nWhat’s going to be left of me after this, you can’t see that. \n[Distressed metal creaks] \n(An inhale of pain from The Archivist) \nMARTIN \nNo! \nARCHIVIST \nI can’t protect you from this. Go! \nMARTIN \nI’m not leaving you trapped here killing the world while I watch! \nARCHIVIST \nIf you stay, you’ll die! \nMARTIN \nThen I’ll die! \nARCHIVIST \nNo! \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 200 – Last Words \n22 \n[A high-pitched tone; crumbling stone and building as another \nexplosion rips through; fires in the background] \n(Martin cries out, then starts sobbing) \n[A glitching noise] \nARCHIVIST \nMartin please! I can’t lose you. Not like this… \n(Martin sobs) \nMARTIN \nTough! Okay? Where you go, I go! \nARCHIVIST \nThat’s the deal... \n[Panopticon continues to collapse and burn; a sharp static whine] \nOkay. \nMARTIN \nWhat? \nARCHIVIST \nDo it! The knife’s just there. Let them go. \nMARTIN \n(Tearful) I’m not going to kill you! \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 200 – Last Words \n23 \nARCHIVIST \nCut the tether. Send them away. \nMaybe we both die. Probably. But maybe not. (Emotional) Maybe, maybe \neverything works out, and we end up somewhere else. \nMARTIN \nTogether? \nARCHIVIST \n(Emotional) One way or another. Together. \n(Martin takes sobbing breaths) \n[A metallic clink as Martin picks up the knife] \nMARTIN \nI don’t think I can... \nARCHIVIST \nIt has to be you. The Eye won’t let me do it. \nMARTIN \n(Sobbing) Are you sure about this? \nARCHIVIST \n(Humourless laugh) \nNo. \nBut I love you.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 5, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 4300}}
