And it did turn on in a \nsudden flash of brilliance and the singing stopped. \nIn the silence I shone the makeshift torch in front of me and saw a broken pew. \nThe floor was once again covered in junk and I could see the doorway behind \nme, leading out into the night. I ran, calling Kathy first, and then the police. \nThey didn’t find anything, of course. They gave me a telling off about \ntrespassing and took down a missing person report about Natalie. Nothing was \nfound, and as far as I know she’s still gone. I didn’t tell Kathy exactly what \nhappened for a few weeks, but when I finally did, she made me come here and \ntalk to you. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG025 – Growing Dark \n12 \n \nI think that’s everything. Can I go now? \n \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nStatement ends. \nThe last section, naturally, is the one that invites my scepticism, but let us \ndisregard that for now and discuss the other aspects. Sasha has confirmed that \nNatalie Ennis was reported missing by Mr. Bilham on March the 11th 2015. \nThere were no leads regarding her location beyond the piece of paper \nmentioned in the statement, and no traces of any church or cult was found \nwithin the Hither Green Dissenters Chapel or the graveyard surrounding it. \nWhen we contacted Mr. Bilham and Ms. Harper to follow up, neither of them \nhad heard from her in the intervening year, nor did they have anything to add \nto the statement. \nThe symbol upon the piece of paper does indeed resemble a stylised, closed \neye, and there are enough other parallels to statement 0020312 to make me \nsuspect – and a suspicion is all that it is at present – that the People’s Church \nof the Divine Host may still be in existence. Also of note, the words “Ny \nAlesund”. I don’t know for sure if Mr. Bilham remembered them correctly, but \nTim pointed out that Ny-Ålesund is actually a small town in Norway. In fact, \nexcept for research installations, it is the most northerly human settlement on \nEarth, located at a latitude of North 78°55′30″. It is a company town, owned \nand operated by Outer Bay, but what it has to do with Mr. Bilham’s account is \nanyone’s guess. Assuming it isn’t all… coincidence. That far north… during the \nwinter… nights can last for a very long time \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG025 – Growing Dark \n13 \n \nMartin found one other thing while combing through police reports for the \nHither Green area. About a month after this statement was given, on May 15th \n2015, police were called out to once again investigate the chapel. Neighbours \nhad apparently heard screams from inside, just after 11pm, but when officers \narrived they found nothing to indicate any sort of incident or foul play. I’d be \ncontent enough to ignore this… if it wasn’t for the fact that, according to the \nofficial file, May 15th 2015 was day Gertrude Robinson, my predecessor, \npassed away. \n[Post statement] \nRecording Ends. \n[The Magnus Archives Theme - Outro] \n \nThe Magnus Archives is a podcast distributed by Rusty Quill and licensed under \na creative commons attribution, non-commercial share alike 4.0 international \nlicense.
