I knew it was you! I knew it! \nMARTIN \nBasira... \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 177 – Wonderland \n7 \nARCHIVIST \nI didn’t mean to. Elias was... \nWe were all playing out this big ritual for him. With me as the lynchpin, the \ngate. \nBASIRA \nOh you didn’t mean to! Oh that’s all right then. Christ! I should’ve known... I… I \nshould’ve just let Daisy take you out at the start. \nMARTIN \nYou don’t mean that. \nBASIRA \nNo? \n(Exhales) I don’t know. Maybe. If I had... it would have stopped all this, \nwouldn’t it? \nARCHIVIST \nPerhaps. \nPerhaps not. \nBASIRA \n(Sarcastically) I thought you knew everything? \nMARTIN \nHe can’t do hypotheticals. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 177 – Wonderland \n8 \nBASIRA \nAnd if I killed you now? \nMARTIN \nWhat did I just say? \nARCHIVIST \nYou couldn’t. And even if you could, it wouldn’t be enough to undo what’s \nhappened to the world. \nBASIRA \nSo… what? You’re the immortal god of this messed up little hellscape now? \nARCHIVIST \n‘God’ might be stretching it. (deep breath) But I am more powerful now, yes. \nBASIRA \nBrilliant. \n(Beat) \nMARTIN \nOkay, well since we’re talking, I-I was wondering… I don’t know if, if I missed it, \nor if you both just assumed that I knew, since you knew it already, but, well... \nBASIRA \nSpit it out. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 177 – Wonderland \n9 \nMARTIN \nWhat was the deal with Trevor? Why was he... I mean, I’m not really sure what \nhappened back there? \nBASIRA \nSeriously? You brought him here, and you didn’t brief him, Mr All-Seeing-Eye? \nMARTIN \nOh, he just keeps being vague and ominous. \nBASIRA \nWell, some things don’t change then. \nARCHIVIST \nIt was a courtesy. I wasn’t sure what you’d be comfortable with me sharing. \nBASIRA \nOh how generous. \nMARTIN \nBasira… \nWe want to help you. \n(Long beat) \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 177 – Wonderland \n10 \nBASIRA \nSo, when everything went sideways at the institute, I lost track of Daisy and \nJulia Montauk. I know Daisy managed to kill her, but I don’t know the details. \nDidn’t find any sign of them in the Archives, at least. \nARCHIVIST \nIt was about a week later. They’d been stalking each other through the tunnels \nbeneath the city. Daisy managed to corner her in an old subway access, and \ntore out her throat. Trevor found the body three hours later. \nBASIRA \n(Irritated) Do you want to tell it? \nARCHIVIST \nSorry. I thought you’d want me to fill in on the missing details. \nBASIRA \nI don’t. \nAnyway, seems like since then Trevor was tracking Daisy. Wanted revenge, you \nheard him. I was still in the Institute when everything went to hell outside, so I \nguess that protected me from the first wave. Once I saw what had happened... \nthat we’d lost... \nDidn’t feel like there was anything left worth doing, except keeping my \npromise to Daisy. So I went looking. Found Trevor’s trail eventually and started \ntailing him. Hoped I could follow him as he tracked Daisy, but… then you had to \nblunder your way in as always, and I had to step in. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 177 – Wonderland \n11 \nMARTIN \nSorry. \nBASIRA \nIt’s his fault. He used you to bait Trevor, to bait me. \nMARTIN \n(Turning to the Archivist) Wait, I’m, I’m sorry, you used me as bait? \nARCHIVIST \nI used us as bait. I didn’t know which one he’d go for. \nMARTIN \nYeah, sure, but… only one of us was aware of the plan. \nARCHIVIST \nI’m, I’m sorry. I was going to tell you, but then I-I got distracted and… then we \nwere within earshot of him, and I couldn't say anything and... I-I mean, you \nwould have agreed, right? \nMARTIN \nThat’s not the point, John. \nARCHIVIST \nI’m sorry. \nMARTIN \n(Sighs)…It’s okay. I understand. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 177 – Wonderland \n12 \n[Fabric rustles as they embrace] \nBASIRA \nYou done? \nARCHIVIST \nCan we not have a moment? \nBASIRA \nNo, John, we can’t. This is a chase, remember? Time is a factor. \nARCHIVIST \nLess than you might think. \nSo what happens next? \nBASIRA \nWhat do you think? You just cost me my only lead to Daisy. All I have now is \nyou, and you owe me. \nARCHIVIST \nSo I guide you to Daisy. \nBASIRA \nIs she close? \nARCHIVIST \nWhen did I become everybody’s satnav?", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 1, "chunk_count": 10, "chars": 4155}}
