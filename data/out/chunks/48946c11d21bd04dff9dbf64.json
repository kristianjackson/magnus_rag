Episode one hundred and thirty-\none. Flesh. \n[Tape clicks on.] \n(There’s a deep breath. The breathing intensifies, before a determined \nexhalation.) \n[Thunk.] \n(There’s a whimper.) \n[A wet ripping, as of extracting a blade from flesh.] \n(The Archivist makes a pained noise. Then grumbles as his breathing evens.) \n[The tape crackles.] \n(The Archivist clears his throat as a second cleaving is attempted.) \n\n[Thunk] \n(The Archivist whimpers again.) \n[Fleshy extraction and tape crackling again] \nARCHIVIST \n(Pained frustration) Oh, come on… Everyone else can carve up the Archivist, \nbut when he actually needs it... \n[Noise of frustration as metal clatters to the ground] \nMELANIE \nWhat’re you doing? \nARCHIVIST \n(Surprised) Oh! Uh… \n[Closes desk drawer] \nMelanie, I-I’m… S-Sorry, I didn’t, er… I didn’t know you were there. \nMELANIE \n(Enunciating carefully) What are you doing? \nARCHIVIST \nI’m... Would you believe I’m… trying to save Daisy? \nMELANIE \n(Sharply) With more bullshit surgery? \n\nARCHIVIST \nOh I... Melanie, I-I-I’m so sorry. \nMELANIE \n(Weary) Oh, fuck off! \nARCHIVIST \nI was trying to save your life. \nMELANIE \nYes, well… you did. I think. But I also, y’know, see your face now, when I wake \nup screaming. I feel you digging into my leg. Chalk it up as a win for Team \nArchive, I guess. \nARCHIVIST \nI wanted to ask you. \nMELANIE \nAnd if you had, we wouldn’t be talking right now. I’d have said no, and I’d \nprobably have hurt you. Basira was right. The only way to do it was to \ncompletely betray my trust, and destroy any remaining sense of safety. \nSo, yes. Thank you. \nARCHIVIST \nYeah, I-I’m... I’m surprised you can stand to see either of us. \nMELANIE \n\n(Frustratedly) Who else is there? I mean, Basira is... heh. She’s been the only \none for a long time and, yes, I, sort of, maybe, hate her now. I don’t know. I \ncan’t look at her without my leg hurting. But what else am I going to do? I \ndon’t want to be on my own, and I’m stuck here. \nSo… \nARCHIVIST \nBasira said you were doing better. \nMELANIE \n(Distressed) Would you just stop? (Getting agitated) This isn’t better. I’m not \ndying, and I don’t want to kill you. It’s-It’s… it’s just different! Yes, it’s sort of, \n‘better’, maybe, but… but I can’t— \nARCHIVIST (BACKGROUND) \nNo… Right, no I— Y-Yeah, Melanie— Melanie… \nMELANIE \nDon’t tell me to calm down! Don’t you dare! \nARCHIVIST \nYes, I… \n(Melanie exhales, regathering composure) \nMELANIE \nBasira is... um. Basira deals in ‘intel’ these days, in usable data, assets. Not \nfeelings. Not people. \n\nCrying, shaking, nightmares... that is better. It doesn’t feel like it, but as far as \nBasira sees it... I'm not ‘compromised’ anymore. And… that… is better. \nARCHIVIST \nAt least it’s out. Maybe... maybe It’s enough to start healing? Start letting go of \nthe anger. \nMELANIE \nOh, just stop! Just stop and listen! \nARCHIVIST \nOkay. \nMELANIE \n(Charged tones) Yes, the bullet was bad, right, but it didn’t make me angry. \nAnger is... Anger’s been all I’ve had for a very long time. Years. Maybe since... \noh, I, I don’t know. But everything I’ve done, everything I pushed for was \nbecause I was angry. Angry at being passed over, being disrespected, ignored. \nThat sort of anger, it-it powers you. Right up until it slips out and hurts \nsomeone. I hurt someone. And then one day, I suddenly have this thing that \ntakes all that rage, and it holds it, tells me it’s right, that it’s me. It didn’t stay in \nmy leg because of some ghostly masterplan. It stayed because I wanted it. \nARCHIVIST \n(Realising) Shit. \nMELANIE \n\nYes. \nARCHIVIST \nMelanie, I— \nMELANIE \nSo, why are you trying to chop off your finger? \nARCHIVIST \n(Awkwardly) Oh! I… I um... I nee-need a... I've been thinking of it a-as an \nanchor. I think. I... know. Something I have a connection to, th-that I can use to \nfind my way out of the Coffin when I reach Daisy. I-I figured the strongest \nanchor would be… part of my own body. \nMELANIE \nOkay. So… just cut it off. \nARCHIVIST \nI’m doing my best. \nMELANIE \nHmph. Can’t go through with it? \nARCHIVIST \nOh, th-the blade keeps going in. And… it hurts. Hurts plenty. But then it heals \nup. Pretty much the moment I take it out. No wound, no scar, nothing. \nMELANIE", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 0, "chunk_count": 5, "chars": 4414}}
