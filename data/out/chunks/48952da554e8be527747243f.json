Episode ninety-eight. Lights Out. \n[Tape clicks on. There’s the sound of shuffling papers.] \n(A long exhalation.) \n[A door opens.] \nTIM \nOh. \nMARTIN \nOh, er… \nTIM \nSorry, didn’t know you were here. \nMARTIN \nNo, it’s-it’s-it’s alright. Kind of glad, to be honest. Need a distraction. Got \nanother statement to record. \nTIM \nStill doing those? \nMARTIN \n\nYeah. Yeah. I did ask Elias if I could stop. \nTIM \nAnd he said no for a mysterious reason? \nMARTIN \nI don’t know. I mean, he kind of explained. I think? John’s “too inconsistent” at \nthe moment. He needs to make up for the shortfall. Which, I guess means me. \nUnless... \nTIM \nNo. \nMARTIN \nHe did suggest I try to get you involved and— \nTIM \nAnd I suggest he not be a scary, magic psychopath. Whoops! Too late. \nMARTIN \nYeah. \nTIM \n(Sighs) Sorry. \nMARTIN \nNo, I- I get it. Heh. They’re not exactly much fun. \nTIM \nLook, it’s not that. I... (Sighs) This place is evil, Martin. And I think doing what It \nwants, probably makes us evil. And It wants those things to be read. I mean, \nI’m not going to stop you, but at the same time… \nMARTIN \nI- I get it. \n\nTIM \n(Sigh) Look, have you talked to John about them? \nMARTIN \n(Flustered) Erm… not…. I don’t know, he always gets so weird about the \nstatements, and I… I guess I... I didn’t want to make him jealous? \nTIM \nJealous. \nMARTIN \nI don’t know! Sort of? I mean… Look, it didn’t come up, alright? Have you seen \nhim since...? \nTIM \n(Grunts) Kind of. We tried to talk, but he, he reached for that— Ah, he, he \nwanted to turn on his recorder. I freaked out a bit, and I said some stuff: if he \nwanted to talk, no tapes, I just, I just hate that thing. \nYou? \nMARTIN \nYeah, we talked. Not long, he— Y’know, I think he thinks that the distance \nkeeps us safe, you know? Like, like, if he just makes sure that we’re not \ninvolved, we’re somehow fine. \nTIM \nHe’s an idiot. Look, we didn’t know what that door was, and it still trapped us. \nIgnorance isn’t going to save anyone. \nMARTIN \nNo, I mean, you’re right, I guess. He was… Y’know, we know about Sasha now, \nand… he said he doesn’t want to lose anyone else. Like, y’know, it’s his fault. \nTIM \n\nIsn’t it? \nMARTIN \nNo! No, it isn’t! I mean, you heard Elias... We never really stood a chance. \nTIM \nYeah. Maybe. But Elias wasn’t actually the one who offered me the job down \nhere. \nMARTIN \nNo, I— Sure. \nTIM \nL-Listen, I, I’ve gotta go. I’ve got... stuff to do. \nMARTIN \nSure. \n[Door closes] \n(Martin sighs, gathers papers. There’s a pause as he notices a tape recorder.) \nHuh. Yeah, y’know, y’know what? A little privacy would be nice sometimes, \nokay? Not everything’s for you! You don’t need to listen to everything that \nwe— \nAlright, you know what? Y’know what… If you’re that eager, fine. \nMartin Blackwood, Archival Assistant at the Magnus Institute, recording \nstatement number 8640514. Statement of Doctor Algernon Moss, given May \n14th 1864. \n(Clears throat) \nMARTIN (STATEMENT) \nMy story, such as is, should not be long in the telling, though there is much you \ncould understand of the circumstances surrounding it. I come to you not to \nwallow in my condition, or pour out my soul like a papist in the confessional,", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 0, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 3387}}
