We lash out at each other without ever really \nknowing why. I think Gertrude knew this, knew to focus her attention on those \nparts that could be understood and, well, and killed. But I’m really starting to \nworry there aren’t any answers, not like I want there to be. There aren’t any \nanswers at Ny-Ålesund. There aren’t answers in the past. I’ve been inside the \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 145 – Infectious Doubts \n \n17 \n \nBuried, and there were no answers there. Elias always seemed to know what \nwas going on, to have a plan, but I sometimes wonder just how orchestrated \nsome of it really was. \nWe’ve been back in London for just over a week now. I’m more or less \nrecovered physically. It’s just this nagging sense of unease that won’t leave me. \nI was so sure I’d find something up there, but instead it was just another \nbroken person trying to come to terms with the wreckage of their life. And \nhere, I reached out, took another tape, hoping for a bit of guidance, but to be \nhonest, this hasn’t helped. \nI did some more digging into Eugene Vanderstock. I thought he was still alive \nand working at the steel plant, but it looks like he’s just listed on one of the \ndirectory pages on their website. I really miss having people who know their \nway around a computer better than I do. A bit more digging found a rather \nbizarre case. Apparently, he disappeared in late 2009, leaving behind only one \nthing: a life-sized statue of himself, crafted from candle wax and sawdust, \nmissing its head. I wish I didn’t know how painful it must be to be alive while \nyour whole being is infused with agonising grit, but as I was investigating, it \ncame to me. Eugene is still alive, frozen in place by the razor-sharp particles \nthat are mixed up into what he chose instead of flesh. I don’t know where \nGertrude stored his head, but I do know it desperately wants to scream. \nPerhaps I— \n[Knock at the door. The door opens.] \nGEORGIE \nKnock, knock. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 145 – Infectious Doubts \n \n18 \n \nARCHIVIST \nOh, G-Georgie? What are you— \nGEORGIE \nOh, sorry, I thought, um ... Is Melanie about? \nARCHIVIST \nMelanie? Uh, yeah, I saw her a couple of hours ago in the other office. I can \nshow you? \nGEORGIE \nOh, I’m sure I can find it. Don’t worry yourself. \nARCHIVIST \nAll right. Why are you, uh, well, here? If it’s not too personal a question. \nGEORGIE \nIt is a bit. It’s not really my place to discuss it. \nARCHIVIST \nTherapy! You’re taking her to therapy? \nGEORGIE \nShe told you, then? \nARCHIVIST \nUh, yes. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 145 – Infectious Doubts \n \n19 \n \nGEORGIE \nWell, you don’t need to sound quite so psyched about it. She gets nervous \ntravelling there alone. \nARCHIVIST \nYes, of course. I forget you two know each other. \nGEORGIE \nSo, how are you doing? \nARCHIVIST \nI’m ... I’m alright. I’m trying to, uh, rest up a bit, take it easy. \nGEORGIE \nReally? Cos I’m pretty sure I heard you talking about a screaming headless \ncorpse just now. \nARCHIVIST \nOh, were you listen— \nGEORGIE \nOh, um, didn’t mean to. You know, these doors are not that thick. \nARCHIVIST \nFine. I’m deep in it. Had some close calls. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 145 – Infectious Doubts \n \n20 \n \nGEORGIE \nI’m sorry to hear that. You should probably get some therapy too. \nARCHIVIST \nWould you go with me as well? \nGEORGIE \nNo. \nARCHIVIST \nYeah, I thought as much. \nGEORGIE \nThe other office, you say? \nARCHIVIST \nYeah. \nGEORGIE \nYeah, thanks. Take care of yourself. \nARCHIVIST \n(Sighs) You too. \n[Door closes] \nARCHIVIST (Cont.) \nEnd recording", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 5, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 3864}}
