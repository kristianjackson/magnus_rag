It was rare that the topic of parents or family would be raised \nor discussed without his appearing, as if from nowhere, to quietly volunteer \nthe fact that his parents were dead, or his lack of siblings, or whatever it might \nhave been. Whatever familial bond was the topic of conversation, Benoît \nMaçon did not have it, and expected, no, demanded that you pity him for the \nfact. It will not surprise you to learn he wore no wedding ring. That when a \n\nyoung couple would enter the café to pass their time in wine and affection, he \nwould simply stare at them, his face a mask of ill-concealed envy. I am deeply \ngrateful it was rare that we had children in Le Papillon, as the one time they \ncame in while he was on shift with him, he vanished for almost twenty minutes \nand, when he returned, it was clear he’d been crying. All told, he was a \npathetic, lonely man desperate for any human connection. A connection I had \nno intention of offering him. \nQuite frankly, I believe I have spoken more words about Benoît Maçon in the \nlast five minutes than I did in all the many months we worked together. I \nwasn’t even the one that noticed the changes in his behaviour. That was our \nmanager Lucille. About five weeks ago, she off-handedly asked me if I knew of \nany “alteration” in Benoît’s personal or home life. He had, so she told me, been \nsignificantly more cordial with her over the previous few days. He had been \nsmiling, laughing, generally not acting like himself. I told her I didn’t know and \nhadn’t noticed, but the next shift I saw what she meant. It was as though a \ndifferent man were wearing the skin of Benoît, a man who had always known \nthe deep joys of life. \nI watched this new person go about their happy life for almost an entire night \nbefore I finally decided that I simply had to ask him what had happened. At \nfirst he appeared puzzled by my question, but when I told him how much \nhappier he seemed, his smile grew wide. He leaned in close to me and looked \naround playfully, as if pretending to check for eavesdroppers. “A woman,” he \nsaid at last, “François, I am in love. And she loves me!” And then, without \nwarning he grabbed me with both arms and pulled me into a short embrace, \nwhich I was simply too stunned to resist. \n\nUp close, I could not help but notice the faintest of odours from his skin. It was \na damp smell, like decaying wood, and it wasn’t until I had a chance to shower \nand change my clothes after work that I finally managed to rid myself of it \ncompletely. It was not a pleasant smell, certainly, but it was not awful. What \nbothered me was its presence at all. I knew Benoît to be a clean, almost \nfastidious man, prone to wearing slightly too much cologne. This was new, and \nbeyond that there was… something to the smell itself, some memory of a \nchildhood spent in the country around Lyon, of wandering out in the damp \nheat after a summer rain, of turning over logs slick with moisture, to reveal the \ncrawling underbelly beneath them. But for the most part I ignored it. \nAfter all, if I could remain unconcerned about Benoît when he was miserable, \ndoing so when he was happy hardly seemed like a challenge. \nAnd indeed, he continued to be happy, almost to the point of bliss, for almost \nthe entire month following. The smell was growing ever so gradually stronger, \nto the point where I would occasionally see my colleagues wrinkle their noses \nwhen he went to talk to them, but it never quite reached the stage where it \nfelt worth bringing up with Lucille. Benoît’s hygiene more generally also started \nto noticeably decline. At first, his shirts would be wrinkled when he arrived for \nwork, when before I had only ever seen him wear them crisply ironed. Then \nthere were small stains or tears that could be spotted, as his clothes seemed to \nbe washed less and less regularly. \nAgain, none of this was glaringly obvious, and if his behaviour hadn’t drawn my \nattention, it’s likely I never would have noticed it at all. Certainly, none of the \npatrons of Le Papillon Blanc ever seemed bothered by his appearance or \ncleanliness.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 3, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 4345}}
