I don’t know who she is. \nEveryone else says that she’s my mother, and gives me looks of alarm when I \ntell them she’s an impostor. I don’t know what to do. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG077 – The Kind Mother \n2 \n \nMy mother and I have always had our differences. To be honest, it’s only been \nin the last five years or so that we really began speaking again. She was always \na strong-willed woman, never one to blunt her opinions, and throughout my \nchildhood it gradually got worse. Nothing I ever did was quite good enough, \nand any hint of pride I might have taken in myself or my achievements was \nalways undercut by some cutting little critique. Even on those rare occasions \nthat I succeeded at something highly enough to actually warrant her praise, it \nwas always appended with doubt. I remember when I was fifteen I came first \nin an inter-school athletics competition. I was two seconds ahead in the \nhundred metre sprint, and all she could say was, “Make sure being the best \nrunner doesn’t distract you from your exams”. \nIt didn’t really come to a head until I got engaged to Laurence, though. We’d \nbeen dating on and off through university, and I’d sat through enough \nawkward family dinners to know that my mother didn’t like him, but her \ndisapproval was nothing new, so I ignored it. When he proposed to me after \nour graduation, I’d assumed she would simply tolerate it as she had every \nother one of my decisions. I was wrong. When I told her, she got angry. Not the \nchill, disapproving anger I was used to from, but a genuine shouting rage. She \naccused me of throwing my life away, told me I’d regret it, and that Laurence \nwas good-for-nothing scum who’d drag me down and stop me achieving \nanything. I answered her in kind, and the argument that we had that night was \nthe last time I saw her for almost ten years. I’d try to convince myself that our \ndifferences were just that: we were simply two very different people. But \nsometimes I worry that the reason we could never get on was that we were far \ntoo much alike.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 0, "chunk_count": 5, "chars": 2864}}
