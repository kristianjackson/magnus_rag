It nests in the rusted-out \nhollows of fleeing cars, constructing intricate shelters for its young out of \ncorpse-hair and wiring. Its eggs are rusty, covered in slime, and its chicks are \nborn with plastic rings around their necks. They smell like ammonia and salt, \nand their name is meaningless, as there is no longer such a thing as the sea. \nLeah hides behind a cracked vending machine, waiting for the thing to pass. \nShe knows it can hear the rapid scratch of her broken pencil, but it is all she \ncan do to get it down, get it all down on paper, another futile warning of a \nfuture that is already here. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 175 – Epoch \n4 \n[Clattering becomes distant; strange papery and nibbling noises \nstart] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nItem: A history book. \nHardback. Eight-point-five by eleven inches and approximately an inch and a \nhalf thick, although the number of pages is impossible to discern. Its dust \njacket has long since been lost, and what remains is wrinkled maroon cloth \nover soggy book-board. The faded letters of a partial title can be seen \nembossed into the spine. The words ‘A Brief History of’ can be made out \nclearly, but the rest has been burned away. \nThe spine is cracked and broken, but the volume itself cannot be opened. The \nbook has clearly been submerged in some sort of fat or binding agent, and the \npaper within it has fused together into a single, indistinguishable lump of pulp. \nThe wet mass within it retains sufficient moisture that if the covers are pressed \nupon, a thin rivulet of clear liquid will run like tears down the book's cover. If \nyou do this, the book will scream. \n[A strange hissing cry; more follow] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nIt is a stupid thing, a long-dead trinket that was of no use to anyone even when \nit puffed itself up with the fatuous intellectual dribblings of those who believed \nthe past was any defence against the future, bloated as it was with the \nhagiographies of war criminals and smugly grinning murderers. Now it serves \nas a suffering reminder of everything that has been lost; which is to say, \nnothing of value. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 175 – Epoch \n5 \nLeah hates the book. She cannot shake the feeling that once, long ago, she \nread it, seeing within its pages the stark importance of taking action, of trying \nto change the world for the better and avoiding the dead, nightmare future \nthat kept her awake at night. \nBut it was doomed from the start, and those that salivated at the thought of a \nplace in history had secured nothing except its end. \n[Crying fades away; every so often now is the sound of metal wire \njangling] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nItem: A laughable umbrella. \nLook at it. What does it think it's doing here? Lying there, broken, skeletal. \nThere hasn't been rain in fifty years. The soil is cracked and parched. Any \nvegetation that claws its agonized way up out of it, is maggot white and dry as \ndust. The only moisture is from the wet rot of the junkpiles that stretch thirty \nfeet above the ground in all directions, spilling out into the sandy, sloping basin \nthat was once a seabed. Stupid umbrella. Does it think there is a monsoon \ncoming? Does it even remember what a cloud of water vapor looks like? The \nclouds that pass now are oily and stink of sulphur, waiting for you to stop \npaying attention before they climb down your throat and settle in your lungs. \nPerhaps this idiot apparatus thinks it can protect from the relentless heat of \nthe sun, but its fabric is torn and ruined, hanging from the snapped metal \nlimbs, desperate for a breeze to stir it from its, complete stillness. Take a \nmoment to sneer at this corpse of an umbrella, and wish for a moment you \nhad water enough within you to spit on it.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 1, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 3825}}
