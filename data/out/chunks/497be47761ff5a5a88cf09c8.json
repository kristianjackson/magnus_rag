It was \ncoming for us with such a speed that there was a part of me that immediately \nknew, despite all logic, that it was trying to kill me, and me alone. It was the \nworst dust storm I had ever seen, and it promised to blot out everything. I ran \nback inside to warn Stefan, and ask if he had anywhere we could wait it out, \nbut I found him lying on the ground. He was face down, a thin trickle of dirt \noozing slowly from his mouth and nose. I called to Harry, told him Stefan \nneeded help, but he could barely hear me over the wind, which was now so \nfierce that it seemed to drown everything else out. \n\nWhen I finally made him understand, he seemed none too keen to drive \nthrough the storm, and warned me the engine would clog before we got half \nway back to Boise City. I said we had no choice but to try. If we didn’t, then \nStefan was already dead. \nWe covered his face with a cloth, and carried him out and into our small car, \nlaying him into the back as gently as we could. The wind was so sharp it felt like \nit was trying to strip the flesh from my skull; I had to hold my hand in front of \nmy eyes to keep out the dirt that was whipping around at forty miles an hour. \nEven with my handkerchief covering my mouth, I could feel the dust creeping \nin, forming a damp, cloying paste between my teeth. And the storm hadn’t \neven hit yet. \nI climbed into the driver's seat, while Harry scuttled round to the passenger \nside, and with Stefan laid across the back we turned and began the drive back \ntowards town, trying to convince ourselves we had any hope of outrunning the \nstorm. \nWe did not. \nIt bore down on us like the judgement from Heaven, and in less than a \nmoment the sun was gone and the sky was black. I tried to keep driving, but I \ncould hear the engine choking, sputtering, and finally coming to an end. \nIt’s hard to describe just how dark it is in the middle of a dust storm. It’s not \njust the lack of sun but that no light can penetrate more than a few feet, \nbefore the swirling opaque cloud kills it dead. It’s loud, with the wind and the \nsound of those dry specks of earth blasting against the car, but it’s the sort of \nloud that, after a while, starts to feel a lot like silence. We did our best to plug \n\nup any gaps in the windows or the frame, and keep as much of the dust \noutside as we could, and then we sat there, feeling for all the world like we \nwere the last people left alive, entombed within our metal coffin. \nI tried to say something to Harry, to reassure him, but opening my mouth just \ninvited more dust, and I was already coughing more than enough to panic. So \nwe just sat there, in what felt like silence for over an hour, trying not to think \nabout the storm, or the poor Oklahoma farmer dying on our back seat. We just \nwaited. \nAt some point Stefan must have finally died. I know this because when he \nstarted talking to us again, there was no way he could have made those noises \nunless his lungs and throat were fully packed with sediment. The words were \nsoft, insistent and spasmed out of his dirt-clogged body like an earthquake. I \ndon’t remember what he said, not really. It only comes back to me in those \nquicksand dreams, where I feel the earth swallowing me forever. He was \nmaking promises, I think. Promising us that when the sky fell and became an \neternity of mud, he would carve out a place for us in the heart of the forever \nburied. He would show us… the love of ‘Choke’. \nI still couldn’t see anything, but I felt his hand on my face, hot and dry and \nrough, and I tried to scream, but it just let in more dust. Harry did scream, \nthough, and I could hear a struggle going on beside me, grunts and the sounds \nof flesh striking soil, then the sound of a car door opening, and the sudden rush \nof wind and grit. And then it closed abruptly, and I once again sat in the \nunmoving quiet of the car. Except this time, I was alone. \nI never saw Harry Eisenhard again. When the storm finally passed, I spent \nhours searching for him, but he was gone. I did find the body of Stefan, though,", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 2, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 4161}}
