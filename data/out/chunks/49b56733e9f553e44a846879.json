This is … This is forever \ndeep below creation, where the weight of existence bears down. This is the \nBuried, and we are alive. There isn’t even an up. What have I done? What have \nI done? \nDAISY \nNot alone, though? \nARCHIVIST \nNo. No, not alone. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 132 – Entombed \n \n10 \n \n[Music begins to play softly, then fades out] \nDAISY \nJohn? \nARCHIVIST \nStill here. \nDAISY \nGood, I … Good. I want to talk. \nARCHIVIST \nOkay. Um, and what do you want to talk about? \nDAISY \nDon’t … I don’t care. I, I, I just want someone to hear me. \nARCHIVIST \nWell, I’m not going anywhere. \n(Daisy laughs shakily.) \nARCHIVIST \nDaisy? \nDAISY \nOh. I want to, but it’s difficult. \n \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 132 – Entombed \n \n11 \n \nARCHIVIST \nWould it help if I … ask? \nDAISY \nY-yes, alright. Do your thing. \nARCHIVIST \nUm, er, how are you feeling? \nDAISY \nScared. I’m scared. I’ve been scared the whole time here, not just when it’s \ncrushing, when it fills your mouth with dirt. It knows when to stop, or when to \nease back so you don’t lose it or grow numb. Leaves you terrified for when it \nstarts again, and when it does, you’re scared it’ll never stop. I thought I’d never \nsee the sky again, n-never see Basira, b-but now ... You’ve got out of other \nstuff like this. Maybe you’ll get out of this and t-take me with you. But I don’t \nknow what I’ll be o-outside. Th-the Hunt can’t reach me here. I’m s-scared that \n… that I feel more me than I have for years. Maybe all my life. The hunt was \nme, but I don’t think I liked it. I think it just made me need it. I hurt a lot of \npeople, and some who I shouldn’t have. \nDid you ever hear the story Elias told me? About what I did, how I am. He \ndidn’t get a detail wrong. The hunt, the hunger, was in me all my life, telling \nme who to chase and how to hurt them. I never needed to think who I was \noutside of that. But down here, where I can’t hear the blood anymore, I don’t \n… I don’t know who I am without the chase. I just know that I don’t like who I \nwas back outside. I don’t want to be her again. I want to be better. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 132 – Entombed \n \n12 \n \nYou know what I thought when I woke up here? I thought this was Hell. I was \ndead and was in Hell. And I knew I deserved it. I don’t want to be a sadistic \npredator again, but I don’t want to hobble around like some pathetic, \nwounded prey here. I don’t know which would be worse. And I’m scared now \nthat I won’t ever get the choice. \nARCHIVIST \nOne thing I’ve learned, Daisy, is that we all get a choice. Even if it doesn’t feel \nlike one. \nDAISY \nI was going to kill you. You know that, right? \nARCHIVIST \nI definitely got that impression, when you dragged me into the woods for an \nexecution. \nDAISY \nN-no, no, no, after the mission. I was planning to kill you. \nARCHIVIST \nI ... I did not know that. \nDAISY \nI realised you were in my dreams. R-reliving the ... this. The coffin. You were \nthere. \nARCHIVIST \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 132 – Entombed \n \n13 \n \nYes. \nDAISY \nDidn’t think it was real, not really, just my mind putting you there because I \nhated you, but no. One night, you turn up in a new shirt. Didn’t fit you. Not \nyour style. I didn’t think much of it – just a dream. Then you come back from \nthe States, and guess what you’re wearing. \nARCHIVIST \nOh. \nDAISY \nRealised what was happening then. Realised you weren’t human. Needed to \ndie as soon as it was safe, never mind Elias and his insurance. \nARCHIVIST \nAnd now? \nDAISY \nDon’t know. I miss dreaming. You don’t sleep down here. \nARCHIVIST \nDaisy, you should know I’m ... If I wasn’t human before, I’m even less human \nnow. \nDAISY \nYeah, well. At the moment, I don’t care. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 132 – Entombed \n \n14 \n \nARCHIVIST \nAnd if we get out? \nDAISY \nBut we can’t get out. \n[The Earth shifts.] \n(The Archivist grunts in pain.) \nDAISY \n(Pained) I’m sorry. I’m sorry, John. I’m sorry. \n[Tape clicks off. Tape clicks on. The sounds of shifting earth and pained \nbreathing.] \nARCHIVIST \nDaisy. \nDAISY \nI’m here. \nARCHIVIST \nI can ... It’s closer. \nDAISY \nWhat is? \nARCHIVIST", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 2, "chunk_count": 4, "chars": 4094}}
