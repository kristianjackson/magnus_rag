At first I just \nthought he was thorough, but I swear I watched him fill a whole A5 notebook \nin one lecture. I remember it was a talk on youth and the justice system where \nthe speaker was so slow that it wouldn’t have filled that book even if Graham \nhad been writing down literally every word. Not to mention I asked to borrow \nhis notes once for an essay, and he gave me this weird look and said he didn’t \ntake any notes. \nSo yeah, point is, I wouldn’t have called him a friend, but we got on alright. It \nwas about four months into my course that I first encountered Graham outside \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG003 – Across The Street \n3 \n \nof the university. I was riding the night bus home, having gone for a couple of \ndrinks and missed the regular service. I live in Clapham, so there’s a pretty \nregular night bus service headed there. Of course, regular also means drunken \nangry vomiters, so yeah, I generally try to be unobtrusive, sitting in a seat at \nthe back of the top floor. It was there that I saw Graham. He was sat right at \nthe front, staring out of the window. People-watching is one of my guilty \npleasures, so I decided not to say hello, at least not right away. I wasn’t \ndisappointed, either – he was stranger alone than he had ever been during \nclass. It was the middle of winter at this point, so the windows were solid with \ncondensation, but he almost obsessively wiped it away from the one in front of \nhim the moment it started to obscure his view. He seemed to be intently \nscanning the street for something, except that at times he would crane his \nneck to stare at the roofs of the buildings passing by. He seemed nervous, as \nwell, and was breathing way faster than normal, which fogged up his window \neven more. It was slightly alarming to watch, to be honest, and I finally made \nup my mind to tell him I was there. \nHe jumped a bit when I greeted him, and I asked him if he was alright. He told \nme he didn’t usually stay out so late and found night time public transport \nunsettling. I sat next to him, and he seemed to get much more relaxed, so I \ndidn’t push the issue. We talked for a while about nothing in particular, until \nthe bus started to approach my stop. As I rose, I noticed that Graham had \nstood up at the exact same time as I had, and I realised with some discomfort \nthat we must live at the same stop. \nI liked the guy fine, don’t get me wrong, but I still didn’t really feel ok with \nhimknowing where I lived. But yeah, it was obvious that I’d gotten up to get off \nthe bus, so I couldn’t really ride on to the next stop, and it wasn’t even that I", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 1, "chunk_count": 9, "chars": 2719}}
