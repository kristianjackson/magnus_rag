I, I’ll look after it. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG087 – The Uncanny Valley \n2 \n \nGEORGIE \nWha – No, I don’t – You can blow it up for all I care. It’s been in the loft for, \nlike, twenty years. If I need tape hiss, I’ll add it in post. \nARCHIVIST \nSo, what’s the problem? \nGEORGIE \nWith playing an unmarked tape from your stalker? \nARCHIVIST \nUh… Look, you just have to trust me, okay. \nGEORGIE \nYeah, and I want to do that, but how can I when you still won’t tell me what’s \ngoing on? \nARCHIVIST \nYou wouldn’t believe me! \nGEORGIE \nTry me. \nARCHIVIST \nYou’re right. It’s… It’s alright. I can just go. \nGEORGIE \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG087 – The Uncanny Valley \n3 \n \nCome on, I’m not throwing you out, John. I know you wouldn’t be here if you \nhad anywhere else to go, and I… I do want to help, but… y’know, you’re a good \nperson. You were, at least. But whatever this is, it’s messing you up! \n(Sigh) Look I’ve, I’ve got work to do. You listen, or don’t listen, or cross-record, \nor whatever you want, just… just think about it first, okay? You can choose to \nleave it alone. \n[The door closes as Georgie leaves. The Archivist sighs and puts a tape in the \nplayer.

Committed to \ntape 4th of April, 2015. Gertrude Robinson recording. \nGERTRUDE (STATEMENT) \nEveryone always tells me I don’t notice things. “Sebastian,” they say, “you \nwouldn’t notice if you grew a second nose.” And I suppose in many ways that’s \ntrue. It’s not that I’m forgetful or stupid, you understand, just that I’m not very \ngood at spotting things that are out of place. The mind has a way of filling in \nthings it’s not concentrating on; just wallpapering them over with what you \nexpect to see. I rather think that part of my brain is more powerful than in \nmost people. I’ll never notice if you got a new haircut or piercing, and it’s a bit \nof a gamble whether I notice when you’ve had a baby. \nYou’d think that’d get in the way of being a plumber, but it really hasn’t, to be \nhonest. The thing you’ve got to remember is, if I know what I need to focus on \nI spot things just fine. And plumbing’s great for that – depending on the", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 0, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 2993}}
