What would \nhappen to her? Should I have destroyed it? \nThat last thought was quickly pushed away. I wasn’t sure I had it in me to \ndestroy a book, even one with such a strangeness to it. It surprised me just \nhow easily I accepted that The Boneturner’s Tale had dark powers, but I \nsuppose I’ve always felt that books have a sort of magic to them, so it was \nreally just a confirmation of what I had suspected, deep down, for a long time. \nIt was two in the morning when I decided that I couldn’t just leave it there \novernight. I got up, dressed and, quietly, headed out into the rain towards the \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG017 – The Boneturner’s Tale \n10 \n \nlibrary, making sure to take my gloves. My coat was supposed to be water \nresistant but still managed to soak in the twenty minutes it took me to walk \nthere. I had the key from locking up that night, and deactivated the alarm as I \nentered. \nIt was almost pitch black inside, and part of me wanted to keep it that way, but \nI turned on as many of the lights as I could without it being immediately \nobvious outside the building. It wasn’t many, and I still had to half-feel my way \nthrough the foyer and into the library proper. As I approached the desk and \nthe book returns cart where I had left The Boneturner’s Tale I began to step \nless cautiously. It was darker in that corner of the library and I put a hand out \nto steady myself against the handle of the small metal cart. I’d taken my gloves \noff at that point and my hand came away wet. I quickly fumbled for the torch I \nhad snatched before heading out and turned it on. Red dripped and pulsed \nfrom the cart, soaking the pages and forming a small pool around it. The books \nwere bleeding. \nI laughed at that. It seemed so appropriate somehow, so utterly correct that \nthose neighbouring books should suffer, should be contaminated by it. Just as \nit seemed right and proper that, when my torch found The Boneturner's Tale, it \nwas dry, unmarked by the gory scene around it. \nI put my gloves back on and carefully took out that sinister volume and placed \nit on the desk. Perhaps I should have fought harder against the temptation to \nlook inside but my curiosity was too strong. The thick gloves made turning \nindividual pages almost impossible, and I still had enough good sense to keep \nthem on, so I just opened it on a few random pages and started reading. \nPerhaps I was being paranoid. After all, I touched the book with my bare hands \nwhen it was first given in to the library, and had no problems, but the image of \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG017 – The Boneturner’s Tale \n11 \n \nJared's mother wouldn't leave my head. How her arm had twisted when it \nmoved. I decided to keep the gloves on. \nIt was written in prose, and certainly seemed to be a story of some kind. The \npart I read dealt with an unnamed man, at various points referred to as the \nBoneturner, the Bonesmith or just the Turner, watching an assembled group of \npeople as they made their way into a small village. It's unclear from what I read \nwhether he is travelling with them, or simply following them, but I remember \nbeing unsettled by the details he observed in them: the way the parson would \nmove his hand over his mouth whenever he stared too long at the nuns or how \nthe cook looked at the meat he prepared with the same eyes that looked at \nthe pardoner. It was only at that point that I realised the book was describing \nthe pilgrims from The Canterbury Tales. \nNow, this certainly wasn't some lost section of a Chaucer classic. It was written \nin modern English, with none of the archaic spelling or pronunciation of the \noriginal, and besides that the writing itself was of questionable quality. There \nwas something compelling about it, though. The debate about how finished \nThe Canterbury Tales were… well, it's a very real debate. In the Prologue, over \na hundred tales are promised, but the most complete surviving version doesn't \neven reach two dozen. The book just sort of ends, with Chaucer adding a short \nepilogue imploring God for forgiveness. A plea that is generally read as \nsarcastic or rhetorical. \nI flicked ahead a few pages, and found the Bonesmith had apparently crept up \nto the Miller while he slept. It described him silently reaching inside him, and... \nit's a bit hazy. All I remember clearly is the line “and from his rib a flute to play \nthat merry tune of marro", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 5, "chunk_count": 9, "chars": 4500}}
