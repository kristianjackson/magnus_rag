I think I was still gassed, and it was dark, but... I found \na room. \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nGo on. \n \nTIM \nI didn’t stay long, ‘cause it had a lot of worms in, and they weren’t \nacting like the others. They were sort of... wrapping around each \nother, like they were trying to form a... thing, like a structure or \nsomething. A ring. \nI was probably still out of my skull, and half-hallucinated the whole \nthing, but it looked like they were trying to make a doorway. \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG040 – Human Remains \n13 \n \nA doorway? Is it still there? \n \nTIM \nNo. I pumped two full extinguishers into that room. Nothing was \ngetting out. \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nGood. Good. Go home, Tim. Get some sleep. \n \nTIM \nHeh. \nYeah. \nSure. \n{CLICK] \n[CLICK] \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nStatement of Sasha James, archival assistant at the Magnus \nInstitute, regarding the invasion by the entity formerly known as \nJane Prentiss. Statement recorded direct from subject, 29th July \n2016. In your own time. \n \nNOT!SASHA \nYes... Where do you want me to begin? I was with you until I ran out \nto save Tim. Then we were separated, and I fled into the Institute \nproper. I pulled a fire alarm, because the worms were following me, \nand I didn’t want anyone else to get hurt. I went to Elias. We talked. \nWe were going to save you, but the worms came, and I fled into the \nArtefact Storage room. You know I hate the Artefact Storage room, \nso it must have been bad. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG040 – Human Remains \n14 \n \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nYou used to work there, didn’t you? \n \nNOT!SASHA \nYes, for three months. It was dreadful. I used to think that it was the \nmost dangerous place in the Institute. \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nNot anymore. \n \nNOT!SASHA \nYes, not anymore. It was safe enough. The worms didn’t get in, and \nI stayed there until the fire system deployed, then I ran out to get to \na window. I saw the worms in the main Institute. They shrivelled \nand died. I don’t think I’ll ever forget that scream though. I could \nhear Prentiss screaming even from there. \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nWell, it’s thanks to you, to be honest. If you hadn’t met that \n‘Michael’ thing... \n \nNOT!SASHA \nYes, Michael... With the bones in his hands. We still don’t know \nmuch about him, do we? \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nNo, not yet. Sorry, getting… distracted. You got as far as Jane \nPrentiss’ death. \n \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG040 – Human Remains \n15 \n \nNOT!SASHA \nYes, I returned to the Archives, and all the worms were dead. You \nand Tim were lying there, but you weren’t moving. You just lay \nthere, the dead worms still half inside of you. The trapdoor was \nopen next to you, and more were inside. I went over to check, and \nyou were alive, so I pulled you back to where there was more air, \nand began to remove the worms. \nAre you alright? \nJONATHAN SIMS \nSorry, just... difficult to hear, you know. \n \nNOT!SASHA \nYes, I understand. That was when Elias arrived with the fire brigade \nand doctors and the hazmat people. They talked to me for a long \ntime, and I did my best to explain the situation. They checked me \nfor worm-marks, but I was fine. They took you away, so I waited \nwith Elias. He was looking at me strangely, but we were both quiet. \nIt had been a very strange day. After an hour or so, we heard cries \nfrom the trapdoor. It was Martin. He was shouting about a body. We \ngot him out, and Elias tried to get him to calm down and explain. He \nsaid he’d found the body of the previous Archivist, Gertrude \nRobinson, and that was when Elias called the police. I tried to calm \nhim down, but he was in bad shape. The police arrived, and I gave \nthem pretty much this same statements. \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nRight... Right. What about the tape? You had the tape recorder, the \none I’d just recorded Mr. Ramao’s statement on, but when you gave \nit back, it was empty. \nNOT!SASHA", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 4, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 4053}}
