Leave it alone! \nMARTIN \n Oh no, no, no, no… \nSASHA \n Turn around. Just turn around. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG039 – Infestation \n8 \n \nMARTIN \n Oh god. There she is, there she is. \nJONATHAN SIMS \n There’s nothing we can do. \nSASHA \n Ah, screw this. \nJONATHAN SIMS \n What, Sasha, NO! \n[DOOR OPENS] \nSASHA \n Tim, look out! \nJONATHAN SIMS \n Watch out for the tape… \n[CLICK] \n[CLICK] \nTIM \nstill working? Ah, okay. Test, test. What are you doing on the floor? Huh. [Imitates Archivist voice] \nStatement of Joe Spooky, regarding sinister happenings in the downtown old… \n[DOOR OPENS] \nSASHA \n Tim, look out! \n[WORM SOUNDS INTENSIFY] \nTIM \nSasha? \nSASHA \n Behind you! Run! \nTIM \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG039 – Infestation \n9 \n \nOh… \n[A CHORUS OF WORM SOUNDS] \nPRENTISS \nDo you hear their song? \nSASHA \n TIM! \n[IMPACTS, WORM SOUNDS AND FIGHTING] \nSASHA \n [BREATHING HEAVILY AND STUMBLING THROUGH DOORS] \nSASHA \n Damn it! \n[CLICK] \n[CLICK] \nJONATHAN SIMS \n Right. There we go. Martin, what do you see? \nMARTIN \n Hm? What? \nJONATHAN SIMS \n I can’t really stand up yet. I need you to describe what’s going on. For the record. \nMARTIN \n Ah, yeah. Sure. So, um, Sasha tackled Tim and there was kind of a struggle, but she made it out of \nthe Archives. That, that was about two minutes ago and she’s gone to get help. P-Probably. I mean, \nshe, she couldn’t... she wouldn’t just run so... \nJONATHAN SIMS \n Did it look like any of the worms... got her before she left? \nMARTIN \n No. I don’t think so. Tim neither, I think. It was hard to tell after she tackled him. There was just a lot \nof movement and, and shouting and, and wriggling… \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG039 – Infestation \n10 \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \n Stay with it, Martin. Tim. What happened to Tim? \nMARTIN \n They got split up and he ran into the office. You said that’s where you made the hole. When you \nwere recording. And they all came through, so... he’s dead. He’s dead in there and he’s covered in \nworms and that’s it. \nJONATHAN SIMS \n We don’t know that. \nMARTIN \n …Maybe Maybe, maybe he found the spare CO2. \nJONATHAN SIMS \n Spare? What? Where? I never saw any. \nMARTIN \n Oh, I, er... I, I hid them in old casefile boxes. \nJONATHAN SIMS \n What, why? \nMARTIN \n Well, so the worms didn’t know they were there! Look, I know it’s stupid. \nJONATHAN SIMS \n Yes. Yes it is. They’re just... they’re just unclassified parasites. They don’t have consciousness, they \ncan’t plan, they’re just an unthinking infection. \nMARTIN \n Seriously?! \nJONATHAN SIMS \n What? \nMARTIN \n Why do you do that? \nJONATHAN SIMS \n Do what? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG039 – Infestation \n11 \n \nMARTIN \n Push the sceptic thing so hard!? I mean, it made sense at first, but now? After everything we’ve \nseen, after everything you’ve read! I hear you recording statements and y-you just dismiss them. \nYour tear them to pieces like they’re wasting your time, but half of the “rational” explanations you \ngive are actually more far-fetched than just accepting it was a, a ghost or something. I mean for \ngod’s sake John, we’re literally hiding from some kind of worm… queen… thing, how, how could you \npossibly still not believe!? \nJONATHAN SIMS \n Of course, I believe. Of course I do. Have you ever taken a look at the stuff we have in Artefact \nstorage? That’s enough to convince anyone. But, but even before that... Why do you think I started \nworking here? It’s not exactly glamorous. I have… I’ve always believed in the supernatural. Within \nreason. I mean. I still think most of the statements down here aren’t real. Of the hundreds I’ve \nrecorded, we’ve had maybe… thirty, forty that are... that go on tape. Now those, I believe, at least \nfor the most part. \nMARTIN \n Then why do you… \nJONATHAN SIMS \n Because I’m scared, Martin!. Because when I record these statements it feels... it feels like I’m being \nwatched. I... I lose myself a bit. And then when I come back, it’s like... like if I admit there may be any \ntruth to it, whatever’s watching will... know somehow. The scepticism, feigning ignorance. It just felt \nsafer. \nMARTIN \n Well... It wasn’t. \nJONATHAN SIMS \n No. No, it wasn’t. Still, it’s not my fault we’re going to be eaten by worms. Speaking of, can you see \nanything? \nMARTIN \n Not much. They’re just... there. \nJONATHAN SIMS \n How many?", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 2, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 4306}}
