That’s two heads we’ll need to keep cool. My odds \naren’t looking good. \nMARTIN \nOdds don’t matter if you’ve stacked the deck. \nANNABELLE \nTrue. Now settle back. Try to look... intentional. \nMARTIN \nWhat does that mean? \nANNABELLE \nThey’re going to expect a suitably elaborate scene when they arrive, a \nmonstrous tableau. I’d hate to disappoint them. \nMARTIN \nRight... \n[Martin gingerly tries to adjust his position] \nSo, w-were you thinking something like this, or—? \n[Annabelle releases a burst of webbing, gagging Martin and \nwrapping him firmly] \n(Muffled indignancy from Martin) \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 197 – Connected \n17 \nANNABELLE \nMy apologies for the inconvenience, but appearances are everything, Martin. \nNow, if you’ll excuse me, I need to change into something more suitable. \n[Extended sounds of visceral arachnoid transformation: Bone \ncracks and flesh tears, accompanied by a twisted glitching static \nthen stops] \n[Annabelle’s voice is deeper] \nANNABELLE (CONT’D) \nIt is so very important to prime your audience. \n[Visceral arachnoid transformation continues] \nARCHIVIST \nAnnabelle Cane! \n[Annabelle’s transformation completes: her voice is even deeper; \nher breaths have a growl to them, and her talking ends with small \nchitters; whenever she moves it sounds chitinous yet fleshy] \nANNABELLE \nHello, John. Basira. \n[All the tape decks playing statements stop at once] \n(Muffled agitation from Martin) \nANNABELLE (CONT’D) \nCalm down Martin. You wouldn’t want to slip off, would you? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 197 – Connected \n18 \nBASIRA \nLet him go! \nANNABELLE \nNot just yet. \n(Muffled anxiety from Martin) \nARCHIVIST \nCeaseless Watcher, see this scuttling thing. Take it— \n[Annabelle hoists Martin up] \nANNABELLE \nAh. Ah. Ah! \n(Martin’s muffled anxiety increases to muffled terror) \nYou know better than I do if I could actually kill him, but we both know that if I \ndrop Martin from here, he’s gone. \nSo, let’s all settle down. \n(Muffled sadness from Martin) \n(Beat) \nBASIRA \nWhat do you want? \nANNABELLE \nTo give you… all of you, a way out of this. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 197 – Connected \n19 \nBASIRA \nAnd you couldn’t just, I dunno, tell us? \nANNABELLE \nI could, but I needed him to believe me. And for that, I needed him to feel this \nplace, this opening beneath us. \nARCHIVIST \nPut. Him. Down. \n(Muffled demand for release from Martin) \nANNABELLE \nVery well. \n[Annabelle lowers Martin gently] \nBASIRA \nMartin, are you okay? \n(Muffled mm-hmm from Martin) \nYou know, we’d probably be more willing to listen if you hadn’t kidnapped our \nfriend. \nANNABELLE \nI didn’t. He came of his own free will. \n(Muffled point of contention from Martin) \nARCHIVIST \n“Free will,” she says, as we stand in the middle of her fucking web! \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 197 – Connected \n20 \nANNABELLE \n(Laughs) A fair point. But that’s a debate for another time. \nI simply mean I did not bring him here through force, threat or false pretence. I \nmade an offer, and he agreed. \nARCHIVIST \nMartin, is this true? \n(Martin tries a muffled attempt to explain, followed by a muffled sigh and \nfinally a muffled mm-hmm!) \nBASIRA \nTold you. \nARCHIVIST \nWe’ll talk about it later. Once you’re safe. \n(Muffled downbeat acknowledgement) \nANNABELLE \nHe’s perfectly safe right now. As long as everyone remains civil. \nARCHIVIST \nFine. Speak your piece. Tell us about your “way out”. \nANNABELLE \nAs you wish. \n(Beat) \nThe Great Fears, do you believe they think the way we do? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 197 – Connected \n21 \nARCHIVIST \nThey don’t “think” at all. They just… are. \nANNABELLE \nAlmost true. In truth, it depends on the Fear. Some exist in an eternal moment, \nsome make use of memory to reflect and corrupt, but for most, time is simply \nanother thing for them to play with. To consider the future, to plan, is not \nsomething they’re capable of. \nARCHIVIST \nBut not The Web? \nANNABELLE \nNo. Not the Mother-of-Puppets, the Spinner-of-Schemes. \nBASIRA \nHang on. What about the rituals? Those were plans. \nARCHIVIST \nNo. They were... desires, filtered and interpreted by people, and the thinking \ncreatures that they spawned. \nANNABELLE \nYou are well informed, aren’t you? Exactly this. They hungered for the world, \nto step from the shadows, and gorge themselves on all humanity. \nARCHIVIST \nAnd they have.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 3, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 4429}}
