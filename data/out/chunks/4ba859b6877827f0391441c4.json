There were a \ncouple of words that stuck out, though. It seemed to be about someone called \nJulian, and “Deeth” cropped up a few times, which I assumed was “Death” and \neven one instance of the word “Homycide”, which I didn’t even know was a \nword back then. \nThe next pages were more of the same, though I did gradually get more and \nmore so I could understand it, each was in a very different hand, until it \nreached the entry on Christopher. This was one of the first with printed type, \nand like the others, had no real heading or formatting, just a solid block of text \n\nthat covered the page. It was an account of the death of somebody named \nChristopher, which apparently took place in the Year of our Lord Fifteen \nNinety-Two. He was dragged through the streets of Norwich by a horse, \nscraping off a good deal of skin on the jagged, frozen ground. After about ten \nminutes of leaving this bloody trail, the horse proceeds to stop, turn around \nand slam its hooves into his head until it caves in. Christopher does not lose \nconsciousness until the third impact. This whole scenario was described in \nvivid, graphic detail. I felt a bit unwell, reading the account of how it felt for \nhim to hear his own skull breaking. \nIt soon became clear that all the accounts were similar. Each detailed a death, \noften violent, always unpleasant. They were in chronological order, with what \nlooked like five to ten years between each one, though sometimes they came \nmuch quicker, one after the other. I also started to notice, on some of the \npages, a faint scorching around the edges, though it would be some time \nbefore my own attempts to burn it proved how resilient it really was. \nAs it went through the ages, the style and the manners of death updated with \nit, though no-one found in those pages seemed to die naturally. I wasn’t \nreading them very closely at that point, one gruesome death being very much \nlike another, when I reached the last two pages before the book’s contents \nbecame blank. The penultimate was for Philip Doah, and the last one, as I’m \nsure you might have guessed, was for me. \nIt was hard, reading the book’s description of Phil’s death. It lingered on his \nterror as he felt himself falling off the platform, the screech of the train’s \nwheels as they rumbled unstoppably towards him. It said that though his legs \nwere severed and his body crushed, it had taken him almost two minutes to \ndie as he watched his blood flowing out along the rails. \n\nI couldn’t believe what I was reading. It was sick. Could someone have put this \nin the book after his death? Why would they do something like that? Or could \nit be that Phil’s accident had been more deliberate than everyone thought? \nMaybe it was suicide? But even then, I mean, I respect anyone’s right to end \ntheir own life, but even if that was the case, writing gory fiction about it \nbeforehand is well beyond anything that Phil was capable of. I didn’t know \nwhat to do. Should I tell someone? And tell them what? The book was old, and \nthese pages look newer than the old handwritten bits, sure, but they still did \nlook like part of the book. If this was some elaborate hoax or morbid joke, \nwhoever did it had a whole book deliberately written, printed and very \nconvincingly aged just to play it on me, whose only significance was that I kind \nof didn’t like a man who died. None of it made any sense. \nFinally, I turned to the last page before they turned blank. It was my death. It \nwas to occur, so it said, in 2014. Eleven years in the future. I was apparently to \nbe walking along an isolated country road in Lancashire, of all places, when a \npassing car would lose control and run me down. The impact would drive me \ninto the wooded barrier, impaling me on fallen tree branch. The driver was \nkilled in the crash, and no-one else would pass by as I lay there, alone and \nscreaming for help, until my body finally gave up. It was quite particular about \nhow the jagged wood was going to feel as it passed through my torso. \nI closed the book and tried to understand what I had just read. It was a joke. It \nhad to be. A sick prank by someone who had clearly hated me far more than I \nhad expected. Phil had decided to kill himself, and had this made to harass me \nafterwards. It was the only explanation that made any sense. Besides, even if it \nwas somehow true and this", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 2, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 4499}}
