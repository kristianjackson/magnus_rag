He told \nme he didn’t usually stay out so late and found night time public transport \nunsettling. I sat next to him, and he seemed to get much more relaxed, so I \ndidn’t push the issue. We talked for a while about nothing in particular, until \nthe bus started to approach my stop. As I rose, I noticed that Graham had \nstood up at the exact same time as I had, and I realised with some discomfort \nthat we must live at the same stop. \nI liked the guy fine, don’t get me wrong, but I still didn’t really feel ok with \nhimknowing where I lived.

I decided to just walk back \nwith him as far as necessary and make sure he didn’t see what building I went \ninto. Maybe we weren’t even walking in the same direction. Yeah, we were \nwalking in exactly the same direction. We even seemed to be heading to the \nsame street.It was at that point I felt a hand grab my shoulder and throw me \ninto the road. I don’t know how else to describe it, one moment I was walking \nalong, the next I was flying towards the ground. It can’t have been Graham – \nhe was in front of me at the time, and I would have sworn there was nobody \nelse on the street. There weren’t any cars coming, but I hit my head hard. I \nthink I must have been unconscious for a few seconds, because the next thing I \nremember is a panicky Graham on the phone to an ambulance. I tried to tell \nhim I was alright, but didn’t really manage to get the words out, which, yeah, \nprobably meant I wasn’t alright. \nThe ambulance arrived in pretty good time, considering it was London on a \nFriday night, and the paramedics gave me a look over. I was told that the injury \nitself wasn’t serious – apparently head wounds always bleed that much and it’s \nnothing to panic about – but that I did have quite a nasty concussion and \nshouldn’t be left alone for the next few hours. Even though we were within \nsight of my door, I had for some reason settled upon the idea of Graham never \nknowing where I lived. In retrospect this was likely the concussion talking, but \nthe upshot was I agreed to go back to Graham’s flat to recover. He was quite \nawkward about the whole thing, and took great pains to assure me that there \nwas nothing untoward about the situation; apparently he was gay, which I’ll \nadmit did actually reassure me a bit. Still, it was clear this wasn’t how either of \nus had hoped to be ending our nights. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG003 – Across The Street \n5 \n \nAs it turned out, Graham’s flat was directly across the street from mine, just a \ncouple of floors lower. I wondered if I could see my window from his, and I \nremember I had the odd thought that, if I had to look out, I’d need to be \ncareful of his window box, as I could see the hooks attaching it to the frame. I \nasked him what he grew, and he gave me a look, as though my concussion had \nstopped me making sense again. I mean, maybe it had, because when I looked \nback at the window the hooks were gone, and there was no sign of any \nwindow box. At the time I put it down to my head wound, and even now I’m \nnot sure. \nThe flat itself was a simple affair, quite big by London standards. It had only a \nfew pieces of furniture and a lot of bookshelves, each covered with rows and \nrows of identical notebooks, with no apparent marking system or indication of \ncontents. I started to ask about them, but my head throbbed and I didn’t feel \nup to any answer that might have been forthcoming. Graham led me to the \nsofa and disappeared to fetch me an icepack and a mug of sugary tea. I \ngraciously accepted both, though I wasn’t in much of a mood to talk. Graham \nclearly felt awkward enough with the silence to do the talking for both of us, \nand I learned more about him over the next hour than I’d ever had a desire to \nknow. Apparently his parents had died in a car accident a few years previously \nand had left a great deal of money and ownership of this flat. He didn’t need to \nwork anymore and so had found himself somewhat adrift, taking night college \ncourses to pass the time and broaden his mind - his words, not mine. He said \nhe was trying to figure out what to actually do with his life. \nHe talked on like this for a while but I stopped listening about that point, as I’d \nbecome enraptured by the", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 2, "chunk_count": 9, "chars": 4500}}
