I don’t quite know whether this means few travellers go \nmissing in Genoa, or that a lot of travellers go missing everywhere else. \nI’m curious about this coffee shop stranger Ms Nunis met. His description puts \nme in mind of Gerard Keay, though there isn’t much to it. If it is him, then he \nmust have taken this trip shortly after he was acquitted of his mother’s \nmurder. Fleeing the country for a while, perhaps? Maybe there were rumours \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG048 – Lost in The Crowd \n11 \n \nof a Leitner in Genoa? Maybe he was genuinely on holiday? No way to tell \nwithout more detail. \nI am sure of the accuracy of this statement in one area, however. Tim managed \nto get in contact with the Manena Hostel in Genoa and they confirmed that, \njust over six years ago, they had a backpack logged in the lost and found under \nthe name E Taylor. It was never claimed. \nEnd recording \n[CLICK] \n[CLICK] \nSupplemental. \nMichael’s visit last week has been playing on my mind. What struggle is he \ntalking about? And if there is one, what’s his stake in it? What even is he? \nListening back over his visit, I am also struck by something that, in the \nconfusion of his arrival, completely passed me by the first time. His words were \na warning that I cannot trust Sasha, that she was lying about something. Of \ncourse, it is becoming rapidly apparent in my investigation that I can trust \nnobody, but of all of them, Sasha seemed the least suspicious. \n \nI can’t find any evidence she ever even met Gertrude and her working here \nseems the natural progression of a lifelong interest in the paranormal. She’s \nbeen doing her work with the same diligence as before the Prentiss incident \nand indeed, of all of them, seems to have been the least affected. That said, \nshe did lose the tape documenting her experience. Or is she lying about her \nmeeting with Michael? Leaving things out? Or is Michael simply messing with \nmy head, as indeed seemed to be the entire purpose of his visit. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG048 – Lost in The Crowd \n12 \n \nOn another note, I need to be subtler in my enquiries. Here follows a recording \nI managed to make of a short meeting Elias requested. \n[CLICK] \nELIAS \nI don’t enjoy having to have these meetings, John, you know I don’t. \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \n(Sarcastically) Well, I’m sorry you’re compelled to. I assume you’ve had \nanother complaint? \n \nELIAS \nYes. \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nWho from this time? Was Dr Elliott offended I declined to take his apple? Was I \ntoo rude to Michael? \n \nELIAS \nWho’s Michael? \n \nNo, it’s from your team. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG048 – Lost in The Crowd \n13 \n \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nWhat? \n \nELIAS \nMartin and Tim have both approached me. Apparently, you’ve been spying on \nthem. \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nSpying on them? Of course not. No, it’s just I’ve been... worried about their \nmental health following Prentiss’ attack. So I’ve been keeping a closer eye on \nthem than usual. \n \nELIAS \nTim says you were watching his house. \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nWell, that’s just not true. \n \nELIAS \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG048 – Lost in The Crowd \n14 \n \nWell, what matters is that your team thinks that it could be. Look, I... I know \nfinding Gertrude’s body hit you hard. I understand, but you need to leave this \nalone. It isn’t their mental health that’s under scrutiny right now. \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nFine, fine… is that all? \n \nELIAS \nYes. \n \n[CLICK] \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nI need to be more careful about the others noticing my investigations, \nespecially if I’ve further cause to watch their homes. More importantly though, \nI think Elias just moved to the top of my suspect list. I wonder what he’s \nhiding? \n \nEnd supplement. \n \n[CLICK]", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 5, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 3929}}
