I understand, it’s a distressing time, but \nthere’s really nothing to be gained from... acting out. \n[Creak and fabric movements from a bed] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nThere are no windows to escape through, all the— \n[Wood furniture movement] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nYes, as I was saying, all the furniture is very firmly bolted down, and honestly \nyou’re only going to hurt yoursel— \n[A clipboard and pen hits the ground] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nHm. I see. Violence, then, is it? Oh, I assure you there is no way to hurt me. \nNothing you could say or do could cause me even a moment’s inconvenience. \nYour anger is… pointless. Meaningless. \n[Creak and fabric movements from a bed] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 177 – Wonderland \n23 \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nLook, see? The only thing you’ve managed to hurt is your own hand. Now, are \nwe finally in a position to listen to Doctor David, you… meaningless little brat? \nGood. \nNow, I believe it’s time for your medication. \n[Pills rattle] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nOh, no, that stuff you were on before? Mm, garbage. No, I’ve torn up your \nprescription for that. It was… poison, I assure you, warping your mind. No, I \nthink we have something far better here. \n[Pills rattle and one is put on a surface] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nGo on, take it. \n[Pill bottle is placed down] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nTake it. \nOr do I have to get some orderlies to help you? \n[Liquid swallowing; cup is placed down] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nThere you go. Down the hatch. I wonder what it was? Certainly it looked a \npretty appealing colour in the medicine cabinet, but you never can tell with \nthese things. Oh, there you go. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 177 – Wonderland \n24 \n[Creak and fabric movements from a bed] \n[The phone ringing distorts in the background] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nWell, sweet dreams, I suppose. \n[Footsteps as the doctor leaves] \n[Door opens, and the hospital noises are louder] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nDo try to wake up sane. \n(Creepy laugh) \n[Door closes and all SFX stop for a beat] \n[The door opens and closes — heavier-sounding perhaps; the \nhospital can be heard behind it as previously] \n[A clock ticks quietly] \n[The doctor approaches] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nAh, awake at last, are we? Excellent. Allow me to introduce myself. Call me \nDoctor David. And you might be? \n[Creak and fabric movements from a bed] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nNo, I just like to greet all our new arrivals in person and I would like your name, \nif possible. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 177 – Wonderland \n25 \n[Short creak and fabric movements from a bed] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nOkay, well, I don’t think that’s how it’s pronounced, but… if that’s what you’d \nlike me to call you, then I suppose I can do you that favour. \n[Short creak and fabric movements from a bed] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nHm? No, I’m pretty sure I would remember. \n[Short creak and fabric movements from a bed] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nNo, I’m the only Doctor David on staff at Wonderland House. Goodness can \nyou imagine the coincidence if there were two of us. Hah! Hardly bears \nthinking about. But no, I’m the only one here. Fact of the matter is, I’m the \nonly doctor on staff. Most days it’s just me and the orderlies. No-one else \naround for miles. \n[Creak and fabric movements from a bed] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nYou’re sure? Well, that is very strange. Would you mind describing this ‘other’ \nDoctor David. \n[Creak and fabric movements from a bed] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nMmhm? Mmhm? Oh, did he now?
