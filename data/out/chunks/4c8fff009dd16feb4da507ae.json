I don’t know what you are. I don’t even know if you’re listening. I \ndon’t care. Just, if you’re there, I want you to know that I hate you. I hate you \nfor witnessing what’s happened to us. \n \nI used to blame my brother, for going off on one and poking around where he \nwasn’t wanted. I used to blame myself for not helping him. But now... Now it \ndoesn’t matter. I’ve read through enough of these things to know that this \ndoesn’t matter. The only thing you need to have your life destroyed by this \nstuff is just bad luck. Talk to the wrong person, take the wrong train, open the \nwrong door, and that’s it. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG117 – Testament \n \n10 \n \n \nI’m going to hurt them, though. I’m going to hurt the thing that stole my \nbrother and wrecked my life. I’m the ‘distraction’. If it looks like any of the... \ncircus folk, mannequins, whatever, are going to see the others, I’m to make the \nbiggest mess I can. Draw them away; keep them busy. I know what it means. \nThey gave it to me because they think I’ll get angry and do something stupid \nanyway. And they’re probably right. So maybe it’s for the best. \n \nYou know, for the longest time I thought the secret was in balance, in some \ndusty old architect’s work on symmetry, but he failed, didn’t he? What was he \neven trying to achieve? He lived like anyone else. He died like anyone else. \nWhatever he was looking for in his “Balance and Fear”, I don’t think he found \nit. \n \nFrom what I can tell, there’s only one person who’s managed to hurt them, to \nreally hurt them. And that’s Gertrude Robinson. She was cold, ruthless, and \nshe hit them when they were vulnerable, and she sacrificed a lot of people to \ndo it. \n \nHonestly? I hope that John learns something from her, because... because I \ndon’t expect I’m going to be coming back from this. I don’t know if I want to. \nAnd if he needs to pull the trigger, to use me to stop it, well he’d better have \nthe guts to do it. \n \nTimothy Stoker, August 4th, 2017.

It would still be \nthere. That knowledge, it would still exist. I-I-I can’t. I want to help, I want to... \nI’m scared. \n \nCome on.
