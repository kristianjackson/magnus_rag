None of that party ever spoke of what they \nsaw or found there, but Hans went to live with the Becker family out on their \nsmall farm. No-one played “Johann’s Steps” again, and the cemetery was once \nagain left deserted. \nThe only other thing Tobias remembered was that he had once heard a great \nuncle refer to Johann von Württemberg as “Ulrich’s bastard”, which, if the date \non the coin was correct, may be referring to Ulrich I or Ulrich II, but either way \nthat place’s history must stretch back almost six hundred years. \nBut now, I feel I have talked around it long enough. I could fill a dozen more \npages with preamble and research, yet none of that is why I have written to \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG023 – Schwartzwald \n13 \n \nyou as I have. No, I am writing to you to describe what I saw the last night I \nstayed at Wilhelm’s, the event that led to my and Carla leaving a week earlier \nthan we had planned. \nIt was three days after I had heard Tobias’ story that it happened. I had packed \nthe coin and the book away in a fit of superstition and had decided to take a \nshort stroll as the sun was setting. It was beautiful, the crimsons of the \ndarkening sky danced upon what snow was left, staining it deepest red. I \nwalked around the house, smoking my pipe, until I came upon the tracks I had \nleft when heading towards the old graveyard. As the snow melted it had \nformed my footprints into packed dirt and ice that almost seemed to glow in \nthe waning daylight. I gazed at them, and froze. I had made two trips to the \nmausoleum that winter, and sure enough there were two stark sets of \nfootprints heading north. But coming back towards the house, there were \nthree sets of footprints. I felt the presence behind me, and I turned around. \nIt was the man from the cemetery. His wide brimmed hat was removed and he \nstared at me. His head was completely bald, and his eyes were missing. They \nwere just empty sockets but they stared at me. The saw me. Believe or dismiss \nanything else in my letter as you wish Jonah, but I swear to you that I stood \nface to face with a man with no eyes and he saw me. \n \n \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG023 – Schwartzwald \n14 \n \nI backed away too quickly and slipped, falling hard upon the ground. In a \nsecond he was above me, and he smiled. He said something to me, but my \nmind was aflame with panic and I didn’t hear what it was. He reached towards \nme slowly, insolently, as though he sought to savour this moment but would \nnot be rushed. Then, quite without warning, he stopped. His head snapped up \nto stare at something, like a gundog that hears a shot. He stood there, hand \npoised as though in indecision. And then… And then, he vanished, as though he \nhad never been there, and I simply lay upon the ground, winded and afraid. \nNight had fallen by the time I finally pulled myself together enough to run back \ninto the house and begin packing. I told Carla we had to leave as soon as \npossible, though was vague as to the reasons. I still haven’t told her why. How \ndo you tell your wife something like that happened to you? \nWe took the first coach the following morning and haven’t stopped. I didn’t \neven realise the coin was missing until I checked my luggage later. Whether to \na light-fingered servant or just my own carelessness, it is gone, so I must \napologise that I will not be able to share that particular piece of history with \nyou. I must also apologise for the handwriting; I have been committing this to \npaper as well as can be done on a long coach-journey. Still, I look forward to \nshowing you the book I have acquired, and the revelations you will no doubt \nglean from it. \nYours in trust, Albrecht \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nStatement ends.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 7, "chunk_count": 10, "chars": 3835}}
