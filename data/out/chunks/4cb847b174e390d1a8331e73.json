When had that happened? \nHe certainly had both eyes when we had worked together and all ten fingers as \nwell. He’d also had all his teeth, where now I saw gaps all over that dead, \nsmiling face. I shivered, though I don’t know why. \nI won’t go into detail about how I went about disposing of the body. Just trust \nme when I say that even if the cops did find any piece of Noriega’s corpse, they \nwouldn’t be able to pin it on me. And life went on. His boys did come looking \nfor me when their boss didn’t return, but I knew to lay low for a while, and \nsoon enough they realised that if he was gone, they weren’t getting paid either \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG014 – Piecemeal \n9 \n \nway and moved on. And so I had my revenge, and that should have been the \nend of the story. But it wasn’t. \nIt was five days after I killed Noriega that I found the first package. I was on \nTottenham Marshes, near the reservoir, on business you don’t need to know, \nand I came to a metal bridge over one of the streams there. Now this wasn’t a \nplace I went often, and I don’t think I’d ever crossed that bridge before in my \nlife, but there, lying in the centre of it, was a small box. It was wrapped in \nbrown paper and string, like an old-fashioned Christmas present, and had my \nname printed on it in clear letters: LEE RENTOUL, FOR IMMEDIATE \nCONSIDERATION. \nObviously I was a little bit freaked out at this but not as freaked out as when I \nopened it. Inside, lying was a black cardboard box, full of cotton wool and a \nsingle severed finger. It was obviously some sort of threat; some punk \nreckoned they could put a scare on me. No chance. I threw the finger into one \nof the canals and set the box on fire before throwing it in a bin. I headed home \nquickly, keeping my attention all around me and my hand on my knife. I was so \nbusy looking behind me, I didn’t see the hole in front of me, and I tripped. As I \nfell forward, I felt a hot pain in the hand that had been on my knife. You \nguessed it. Falling had caused the blade to slice clean through my little finger. \nI’m not too proud to admit that I screamed at this. I tore up my shirt, trying to \nmake a bandage to stop the bleeding, at least until I could get to a hospital. But \nas I began to wrap it up, I noticed that it wasn’t actually bleeding. The wound \nwas closed. It had healed, like it had happened years ago. I didn’t know what to \nthink. I didn’t know what to do. So I just went home. I wasn’t getting my finger \nback, so I figured I could try to deal with it after a decent night’s sleep. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG014 – Piecemeal \n10 \n \nThere was another box at my flat. Same as before. This one contained two \ntoes. I tried to ignore it and keep my foot well away from any knives, but... I \nwas trying to adjust the settings on my flatscreen when it fell off the wall. Hit \nmy right foot and, well, have you figured it out yet? That was two weeks ago. \nSince then, I lost four more fingers to accidents, most of my toes, this eye I \nmanaged to put out on a goddamn fencepost. I’ve lost count of the number of \nteeth gone, and believe me when I say that you don’t want to know how I lost \nthe hand. Each time, a box wrapped in brown paper: LEE RENTOUL, FOR \nIMMEDIATE CONSIDERATION. \nI’ve tried everything. Once I thought I managed to outsmart it. Spent the day in \nmy bedroom – nothing sharp, no edges. I’d taken out everything except the \nmattress. It didn’t matter, I woke the next morning with an agony in my foot \nfar sharper than any knife could cut, and the big toe missing, just like the one \nI’d received the morning before. \nI knew it was Angela. Of course I did, I’m not thick. Whatever curse she’d laid \non Noriega must have passed to me. I went over there, you know. Went to \nconfront that old… and you know what happened? She let me in. She was, \nnice, civil. Offered me another cup of coffee! I told her where to stick it. \nDemanded, asked, begged her to stop whatever was happening to me. You \nknow what she did? She shrugged. She just shrugged! Told me that “Some \nhungers are too strong to be denied”, whatever the hell that means. So I went \nfor her. I was going to strangle the life out of that curse-flinging bag of bones. \nBut as I reached for her, I... I don’t know. I don’t know what happened. I know \nthat that’s how I lost the hand. I know I chewed it off. \nLook it doesn’t matter. I just need your help. I need this to s", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 5, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 4500}}
