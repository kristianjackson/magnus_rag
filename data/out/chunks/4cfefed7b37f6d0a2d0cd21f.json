Just a- little bit of \npower. \nIt’s kind of nice. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 154 – Bloody Mary \nGERTRUDE \nAre you going to tell me? \nERIC \nThinking about it. \nGERTRUDE \nThink harder. \nERIC \nYou know, you were never actually all that nice to me when I worked for you, \nGertrude. Not like Michael, or Emma. \nGERTRUDE \nEric. \nERIC \nWhat, you gonna threaten me? Look at me. Best I can currently hope for is to \nbe burnt to ash. (inhale, sharp sigh) I’m going to tell you, just- maybe there’s a \nprice? \nGERTRUDE \nWhat do you want? \nERIC \nI don’t know- I haven’t had a chance to think. \nGERTRUDE \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 154 – Bloody Mary \nEric. \nERIC \nFine! (short pause) I want two things. \nGERTRUDE \n(impatient) I’m listening. \nERIC \nI want you to find my son. If Mary is- if she’s gone, or worse, I want you to \nmake sure he’s alright. \nGERTRUDE \n(amused) Hm. I’m not exactly a mother figure. \nERIC \nYou could hardly do worse than her. \nGERTRUDE \nHm. Fine. But I don’t know what growing up with Mary has done to him. If \nhe’s... gone rotten, I can’t promise anything. \nERIC \nI understand. \nGERTRUDE \nI suppose he might be useful. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 154 – Bloody Mary \nERIC \n(Dryly) Oh, sentimental as ever. \nGERTRUDE \nHm. And the second thing? \nERIC \nI want to make my statement. \nGERTRUDE \nIs that really necessary? \nERIC \nI don’t want to disappear on her terms. Or yours. I want to speak my piece, \nhave it recorded. \nGERTRUDE \nFine. Tape’s running. \nSubject is Eric Delano, recorded 21st of July, 2008, regarding... \nERIC \nWhat else? Me, Mary, and the Archives. \nGERTRUDE \nAs you wish. Begin whenever you’re ready. \nERIC \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 154 – Bloody Mary \n(exhale) I’m almost not sure where to start, now it comes to it. \nI always loved ghosts. They fascinated me. Not the rattling chains and horror \npart of it, of course, but the mystery, the promise of secret knowledge, of \nseeing something that no one else was privy to. A secret world that gripped my \nimagination. \nSo when I finished my Masters in library science and saw a vacancy at the \nMagnus Institute, of all places, I jumped at the chance. The chance to pursue \nmy passion and my career at the same time seemed like too good an \nopportunity to pass up! \nIt was only an assistant archivist position, of course, but that was fine. A good \nentry position- I’d, I’d soon move on, I told myself. \nHeh. Yeah. \nAnd for the first few years, it was pretty much exactly the job I’d expected. \nLonger hours than I’d hoped, and the Archivist seemed less interested in doing \nher job than I was, but all told there were worse places to work. \nThen I met Mary. She was like no one I’d met before in my life. She was \nbeautiful, like a- like a shark is beautiful. Every moment she made was \ndeliberate, sharp, and her eyes were always focused on something, always \nwatching. And when she looked at me, I always felt afraid. \nBut there was something else. Something under the fear. Something that made \nme feel very aware of all my blood. \n(Exhale) I don’t know what she saw in me, not really. But when she walked up \nto me and told me that I was taking her to dinner, I couldn’t help but nod.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 2, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 3264}}
