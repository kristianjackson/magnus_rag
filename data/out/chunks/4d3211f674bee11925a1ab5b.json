I have never known loss. But now they are \nwith me always, and I desire nothing but to share them with you. \nARCHIVIST \n(Weakly) Statement… ends. \n[The Archivist collapses. Tape clicks off. Tape clicks on. Clink of a glass on \nwood.] \nBASIRA \nHere. \nARCHIVIST \nThank you. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 128 – Heavy Goods \n13 \n \nBASIRA \nWas it worth it? \nARCHIVIST \nI, I don’t know. Maybe? \nBASIRA \nDid you at least learn anything? \nARCHIVIST \n… \nDaisy’s alive. In there. \nBASIRA \nRight. \nARCHIVIST \nBasira, we, we can’t o— \nBASIRA \nYeah, I can read. \nARCHIVIST \nRight. \nBASIRA \nSo, why give it to us? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 128 – Heavy Goods \n14 \n \nARCHIVIST \nI don’t… I don’t know. T-To taunt us? To lure us in as well? \nBASIRA \nHmm. \nARCHIVIST \nI, I saw that... ‘thing’s’ mind. It’s lost on its own. No partner. No purpose. I \nhonestly think it just wanted to do another delivery. \nBASIRA \nAnd there’s no chance more of the circus survived the explosion? \nARCHIVIST \nI don’t think so. A-At least… Breekon didn’t think so. \nBASIRA \nWhere does the coffin lead? \nARCHIVIST \nThe Buried. \nBASIRA \nRight. \nRight, keep it safe. I’ll be gone a few days. I have some leads I need to follow \nup. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 128 – Heavy Goods \n15 \n \nARCHIVIST \nSorry? \nBASIRA \nYou heard me. Don’t ask about them. And don’t ‘Know’ about them either. \nARCHIVIST \nI can’t exactly control that. \nBASIRA \nLearn! \nARCHIVIST \nI’ll do my best. You can trust me, Basira. \nBASIRA \nStop saying that. \n… \nDo you know how I survived that— the Unknowing? \nARCHIVIST \nI... No. No, I don’t. \nBASIRA \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 128 – Heavy Goods \n16 \n \nNo powers, no magic or… help. I was trapped in that place and so I tried to \nfigure it out, and I did, a little. So I kept doing it. I kept going through until I got \nout. I... reasoned my way of out of that nightmare. \nARCHIVIST \nGood lord. \nBASIRA \nThen everything ended and Daisy was gone. And you were gone. And Tim. And \nthen I got back to the Institute and Martin sent me to meet the ‘new boss’. \nThen I stood alone in an empty office for more than an hour. I can trust me, \nJohn, that’s it. \n… \nI’ll try to be back in a week or two. Don’t think about me. \nARCHIVIST \nRight. \nBASIRA \nAnd don’t open the coffin. \nARCHIVIST \nIt is addressed to me... \n… \nYes, alright. You’re right. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 128 – Heavy Goods \n17 \n \n[Tape clicks off.] \n[The Magnus Archives Theme – Outro] \nThe Magnus Archives is a podcast distributed by Rusty Quill and licensed under \na Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Sharealike 4.0 International \nlicence. \nToday’s episode was written by Jonathan Sims and directed by Alexander J \nNewall. \nIt featured: Jonathan Sims as the Archivist, Frank Voss as Basira Hussain, and \nMartin Corcoran as Breekon.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 4, "chunk_count": 5, "chars": 2867}}
