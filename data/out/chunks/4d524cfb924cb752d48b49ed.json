They also wore soft-soled \nblack canvas shoes, which were almost completely silent when walking down \nthe carpeted halls of the building. It made them even more unsettling, quietly \nwandering the corridors, never quite looking where they were going. Like their \nattention was focused on something you just couldn’t see. \n \nThere was only one of them that ever spoke, at least to me: a young man by \nthe name of Vardan Darvish. He seemed to be the manager, at least as much \nas there was any clear structure, and unlike his colleagues he seemed happy, \nalmost eager to talk. I asked him about it once, and he laughingly told me that \nhis co-workers “didn’t sign up for the quality of conversation”. He’d chat with \nme about my job and the latest headlines, which he always had a strong \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG109 – Nightfall \n \n11 \n \nopinion about. We never discussed any details of his life, though, or his job. He \ngenerally came over to let me know about a blown light bulb somewhere in \nthe building, and then stick around for a bit of conversation. I once jokingly \nsuggested he must be breaking the lights himself for an excuse to talk to me, \nand he laughed, but then got kind of quiet, and didn’t stick around to talk. At \nthe time, I assumed my awkward flirting had made it weird, but unfortunately \nnot. \n \nTREVOR \nThe bulbs were breaking because of what they were doing ‘round the offices. \nI’d been tracking Darvish for a good few weeks by then. There’d been a couple \nof homeless I knew go missing round Parrs Wood, where I was keeping back \nthen. Now, usually I wouldn’t pay much mind, was the summer after all, but \nthey were a couple of weeks gone, so I checked in with shelters and a worker \nthat dealt with them, but no-one had the first clue. I knew Morris had at least a \nkid with a woman down in Moss Side, so he wouldn’t have skipped town, but \nshe hadn’t seen him neither. \n \nMy first thought were vampires, as they like to go after rough sleepers, but I \nknew by then there were other horrors kicking around, not to mention your \nmundane murderers. Didn’t matter to me of course, not by then. I had a hunt \non, and I was going to see it through. It weren’t long after I went down to see \nyou folk, so I was still convinced I were on the way out, and caution weren’t \nsomething I cared for. \n \nDon’t recall exactly how Darvish got on my radar. Someone had seen \nsomething that sent me somewhere that led me to him. I don’t know. Point is, \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG109 – Nightfall \n \n12 \n \nsoon as I saw him, I knew he were the one I was after. There was a smell to \nhim, something dark and sick, rolling off him in waves. Sure, he didn’t smell like \na vampire, but he smelt like something that weren’t meant to be in this world, \nso I reckoned I’d best help him out of it. \n \nTook to following him for a couple of days. I didn’t know exactly what he was \nor what he wanted, so I weren’t keen to charge right in. He seemed normal at \nfirst mind, happy enough in the sun, though he worked nights – that’s how I \nfirst saw him. He didn’t spot me, or if he did, he never paid me no mind. They \nnever do. Third night, I spotted him at work, taking a delivery. It were a big \ntruck for some company called ‘Outer Bay’. Tried to follow them up since, but \ndidn’t find much. Then again, maybe I didn’t know what I were looking for. I \nmean, to anyone else the box they were unloading would have looked like \nnothing much, but if there’s one thing I know, it’s what a box looks like when \nit’s got someone inside. There’s a certain shape it tends to be, and the folk \ncarrying it had to take a second to manage the shifting weight of it. Might have \nlooked like a big old flight case, but as I soon as I saw it, I were certain there \nwas somebody inside. What I didn’t know was, alive or dead? \n \nJULIA \nLooking back, I feel like an idiot. I was watching them unload that same case. It \nwas policy to have whoever was working security present for deliveries, \nsomething about insurance. Thinking about it, I even noticed Trevor lurking \npast the fence, though I didn’t give much thought to just another tramp. \n \n(Trevor chuckles)", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 3, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 4160}}
