But... um, we got greedy, pulled too \nmany out. We… attracted attention. And… well, now there are seven. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 190 – Scavengers \n \n14 \nARCHIVIST \nI’m sorry. I didn’t know. \nGEORGIE \nMartin said you knew everything now. \nARCHIVIST \nNot everything. Between the tunnels, and your and Melanie’s... position \nrelative to The Eye... I’m a bit in the dark here. \nGEORGIE \nNo pun intended. \nARCHIVIST \nSure. \nGEORGIE \n…So what? You, just, want me to just leave the tapes running and hope? \nARCHIVIST \nI want you to accept that trying to stop them listening is only going to frustrate \nyou. \nGEORGIE \nJust promise me these things aren’t going to harm my people. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 190 – Scavengers \n \n15 \nARCHIVIST \nI promise... I promise that they’re not here for you. They’re here for me. And \nmaybe a bit for Martin. They seem to like him. \nGEORGIE \nThat’ll have to do, I guess. \n(Beat) \nIt’s good to see you. \nARCHIVIST \nYou too. \nGEORGIE \nI, um... I think I owe you an apology. \nARCHIVIST \nOh? \nGEORGIE \nI didn’t realise how bad things were for, well, all of you. I mean, I kind of knew, \nbut seeing all this for myself, I... I cut myself off and... I’m not so sure that was \nthe right thing to do any more. \nARCHIVIST \nYou had every right to. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 190 – Scavengers \n \n16 \nGEORGIE \nYeah, but it didn’t exactly help, did it? \nARCHIVIST \nGeorgie, you couldn’t have stopped this, believe me. \nGEORGIE \n…Melanie reckons you’re the reason… all this happened, whole apocalypse \nthing. \nARCHIVIST \nShe’s… not wrong. \n(Long exhalation from Georgie) \nI was the catalyst. I-I didn’t— Elias— Jonah Magnus used me. \nGEORGIE \nWell, obviously. Even Melanie doesn’t think you’d have been stupid enough to \ndo this on purpose. \nARCHIVIST \nOh. Good. \nSo... this is it? You and Melanie sneak into nearby fearscapes, rescue someone \nand hide them here? \nGEORGIE \nWell, it’s a bit more complicated than that, but... yeah, basically. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 190 – Scavengers \n \n17 \nARCHIVIST \nAnd then you just… stay down here? \nGEORGIE \nThese days that’s enough. We still need to eat sometimes, and drink. Found \nsome supply caches down here— \nARCHIVIST \nJurgen Leitner. \nGEORGIE \nYeah, that’s, that’s what Melanie said too. \nAlso, uh, we found a pretty convenient nightmare that’s essentially just an \nendless supermarket. Turns out if you take stuff from it, it stays pretty much \nfine. Not nice, y’know, but... \nARCHIVIST \nI did wonder about the ‘Ennui’-brand coke bottles. \nGEORGIE \nYeah, it’s convenient not subtle. \nARCHIVIST \n…Georgie... Where’s the Admiral? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 190 – Scavengers \n \n18 \nGEORGIE \n(With difficulty) He’s, uh... he’s fine. I guess. He’s enjoying himself at least. He \nwasn’t immune, not like me and Melanie. And he’s a predator, pampered piece \nof fluff that he is. \nTurns out, there’s a place full of cats. And their prey. \nARCHIVIST \nPoor thing. \nGEORGIE \nI go to see him sometimes. I think he’s happy, in his way. But, um... It’s hard to \nsee him like that. He didn’t even know I was there. \nARCHIVIST \nI’m sorry. \n(Beat) \nGEORGIE \nJohn... How do we turn it back? \nARCHIVIST \nI don’t know. \n[Tape clicks off] \n[Tape clicks on] \n[Humming of the tunnel meeting room, where Melanie’s chair is \nlocated] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 190 – Scavengers \n \n19 \nMELANIE \nWas that the recorder? \nMARTIN \nYeah, it just started. \nMELANIE \nBy itself? \nMARTIN \nI didn’t do it, if that’s what you're asking! \nMELANIE \nIt wasn’t an accusation. \nMARTIN \nDo you want me to turn it off? \nMELANIE \nThat depends. Will it stay off? \nMARTIN \nNot if it wants to be a part of things, no. \nMELANIE \nThen let it run. It’s just the two of us and, it’s not like we can attract any more \nattention to ourselves at this point, inviting the snoop-god’s favourite kid down \nfor a chat. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 190 – Scavengers \n \n20 \nMARTIN \nHey, that’s not fair. \nMELANIE \nAnd? I guess the end of the world must’ve left me all snappy. \nMARTIN \nWell… I mean, y— \nMELANIE \nDon’t. Don’t say it. I actually did a lot of work on my anger, you know? Tried to \nput all the supernatural bollocks behind me. And now my therapist thinks I’m \n‘the chosen one’. \nMARTIN \nYeah, the apocalypse does seem to bring out the weird in people. \n(Melanie makes a sound of assent) \nMELANIE \nSpeaking of... uh, you and John, eh? \nMARTIN \nHmm? \n(Martin makes some small assent and chuckling noises) \nMELANIE \nCongrats, took you long enough.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 2, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 4493}}
