I \nreasoned they were unlikely to find me at this stage – I’d not given John any of \nmy details when he spoke to me, not even my name, and if they hadn’t been \nable to find me over the course of the last year, it was doubtful they’d be able \nto track me here. Also, if it had been drug smuggling, as I suspected, £10,000 \nprobably wasn’t so much money to them that they’d track me this far over it. \nAlso, and looking back this sounds stupid, but I’d just grown a beard and \nthought it would be hard for anyone to recognise me as the same guy. So I \nspent a bit of John’s money on renting a nice one-bedroom flat in the Triangle, \nnear the town centre, and moved in almost immediately. \nAbout a week later, I was in my kitchen cutting up some fruit for breakfast, and \nI heard the doorbell ring. I answered it to see two red-faced delivery men. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG002 – Do Not Open \n5 \n \nBetween them they carried an immense package, which they’d clearly had to \nmanoeuvre up the narrow stairs of the building I lived in. They asked if I was \nJoshua Gillespie, and when I said yes they said they had a delivery addressed to \nme and pushed past into the hall. They didn’t seem to be from any delivery \ncompany I knew and they weren’t wearing any uniforms. I tried to ask them \nsome questions, but as soon as they’d placed the box on the floor, they turned \naround and walked out. They were both well over six feet tall and very \nimposing, so there was little I could have done to stop them leaving even if I’d \nwanted to. The door slammed behind them, and I was left alone with this \npackage. It was about two metres long, maybe one metre wide and roughly \nthe same deep. It was sealed with parcel tape and written on the top was my \nname and address in thick curving letters but there was no return address or \npostmark of any sort. I was starting to risk being late for work at this point, but \nI decided I couldn’t bring myself to leave without seeing what was inside, so I \nfetched the knife from my kitchen counter and cut the tape keeping the box \nclosed. Inside was a coffin. I don’t know what I expected but it wasn’t that. My \nknife fell to the floor and I just stared at it in mute surprise. It was made of \nunvarnished, pale yellow wood and had a thick metal chain wrapped around it, \nwhich was closed at the top with a heavy iron padlock. The lock was closed but \nhad the key sitting inside it. I started to reach for it, when I noticed two other \nthings on the coffin lid. The first was a piece of paper, folded in half and tucked \nunder the chain, which I took. The other was the presence of three words, \nscratched deep into the wood of the casket in letters three inches high. They \nread “Do Not Open”. \nI withdrew my hand from the padlock slowly, unsure what I was supposed to \ndo. At some point I must have sat down, as I found myself on the floor, \npropped up against the wall, staring at this bizarre thing that had inexplicably", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 2, "chunk_count": 9, "chars": 2970}}
