The Magnus Archives. Episode one hundred and sixty-\nthree: \"In the Trenches.\" \n[Theme finishes] \n[Tape clicks on] \n[A wind howls across a wasteland] \n[Footsteps walk across a gritty surface] \nMARTIN \nOh, I’m knackered. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 163 – In the Trenches \n2 \nARCHIVIST \nAre you? \nMARTIN \nI- \n[They both stop] \nMARTIN (CONT’D) \nHm. \nWell- Okay, well, no, no; I suppose not. But I think I should be. \nARCHIVIST \nYep. \nMARTIN \nHow long have we been walking? \nARCHIVIST \n(Sigh) Fourteen hours and twenty-three minutes. \nMARTIN \nWhat, seriously?! \nARCHIVIST \nYes. I- don’t think it means much out here, though. \nMARTIN \nWe should probably rest. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 163 – In the Trenches \n3 \nARCHIVIST \nMaybe— I don’t know, I-I don’t know if we can. Rest. It… feels more like, well- \nwaiting. \n(Beat) \n[Bag and foot fidgeting] \nMARTIN \n...So. Are we going to walk all the way to London? \nARCHIVIST \nIf you know an alternative, I’d be very keen to hear it. \nMARTIN \nI mean— cars? You know, planes, trains, automobiles? \nARCHIVIST \nIt wouldn’t help. \nMARTIN \nAlright, a boat then. \nARCHIVIST \nGeography doesn’t work anymore. Space, i- doesn’t work. \nMARTIN \nAlright. So what does that mean? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 163 – In the Trenches \n4 \nARCHIVIST \nIt means the journey will be the journey, regardless of how we choose to make \nit. \nMARTIN \nRight. And you’re sure we can’t just, you know- \n[He shuffles] \nMARTIN (CONT’D) \nSpeed it up a bit? \nARCHIVIST \nNo. \n(He exhales heavily) \nMARTIN \nRight. I just- Don’t like being out here. \n[They walk onwards a few more steps] \nARCHIVIST \nYou see that tower, way off in the distance? \nMARTIN \nYeah. \n(Beat) \n(Sigh) It’s watching us, isn’t it? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 163 – In the Trenches \n5 \nARCHIVIST \nThe Panopticon and the Institute. Merged into something entirely new. \nMARTIN \n(Splutters) Wai- what? No, there’s, there’s no way we can see it from here. \nWe- We must still be a hundred miles from the border, never mind London! \nARCHIVIST \nYou could see that tower from anywhere on Earth. And it can see you. And if \nyou walk towards it, eventually you’ll get there. But you have to go through \neverything in between. \nMARTIN \n(Bright) You’re being ominous again. \nARCHIVIST \nSorry. Sorry. \nMARTIN \nWhat do you mean ’everything ’? What’s out here? \n(The Archivist inhales) \n[In the distance, drums and bagpipes start playing] \nARCHIVIST \nNightmares. Come on, that trench is our first. \n[The sound of distant explosions join the music] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 163 – In the Trenches \n6 \nMARTIN \nWhat tre-? Where did that..? Why is that here? \nARCHIVIST \nIn the world as was, we wouldn’t be too far from Kinloss Barracks. So instead \nwe get the trench. \nMARTIN \nHow’d you know all this stuff? \nARCHIVIST \nNot sure. I just do. \n(Beat) \nMARTIN \n(Quiet) John. I’m scared. \nARCHIVIST \nYes. (sigh) That’s the idea. \n[They start walking] \n[Tape clicks off] \n[Tape clicks on] \n[The sound of full warfare at close range: guns rat-a-tat-tating, \nexplosions, tanks driving nearby; and the bagpipes and drums \ncontinue on] \n[Martin and the Archivist run through the mud] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 163 – In the Trenches \n7 \nMARTIN \n(Crosstalk) (shouting) Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit! \nARCHIVIST \n(Crosstalk) (shouting) Martin! Stay with me; don’t let go! \nMARTIN \n(Shouting) Oh… \nARCHIVIST \n(Shouting) Come on! \nMARTIN \n(Shouting) Shit, shit, shit- \nARCHIVIST \n(Shouting) It’s okay. \nMARTIN \n(Shouting) No! \nARCHIVIST \n(Shouting) You’re okay! \nMARTIN \n(Shouting) No no no, I’m not!
