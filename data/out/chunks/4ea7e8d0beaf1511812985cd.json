Well, uh, sorry, b-but I, um... \nARCHIVIST \nYou have to leave, suddenly? \nMARTIN \nJohn, come on. We’ve been over this. \nARCHIVIST \nNo, it’s fine. I know you’ve got... whatever this is. I’m not going to question \nyou. \nMARTIN \nThank you. \nARCHIVIST \nEven if it looks like you’re doing something really stupid. \nARCHIVIST \nSorry. \nMARTIN \nIt’s okay, I get it. I just... \nARCHIVIST \nI worry. You’re working for someone really bad. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 129 – Submerged \n3 \n \nMARTIN \nYes. I’m not an idiot, John.

I, I’m— \nARCHIVIST \nRight. \nMARTIN \nPlease stop finding me. \nARCHIVIST \nWhat happened, Martin? \nMARTIN \nYou died. \nARCHIVIST \nI came back. \nMARTIN \nYeah. \n[Martin opens the door] \nAnd I’m not going to let it happen again. \nARCHIVIST \nWait, wait, wha— \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 129 – Submerged \n6 \n \n[Martin closes the door] \n(The Archivist sighs) \n[Tape clicks off.
