I know, I know, everyone hates spiders. Any time there’s any list \nof the top however many fears, they’re always up there, and whole horror \nfranchises have been built on the basic premise that people hate spiders. But \nnot like me. Not like this. It’s not the sight of a spider that gets me, not the legs \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG016 – Arachnophobia \n2 \n \nor the eyes or even the webs they leave behind with only the drained corpse of \ntheir insect victims still inside. It’s the presence of a spider. The knowledge of \nits being, somewhere near, waiting to crawl on you, and all the warning you \nget that gentle tickle of its legs as it climbs upon you. \nI’m not explaining myself very well. Let me try and phrase it in a different way: \nI can watch any number of films about the things. Documentary or horror, it \ndoesn’t matter. I can read books on them. I can stare at close-up pictures of \ntheir weird spider faces all day long, and there’s hardly a shudder from me. But \nI had to move from my last house after discovering how many spiders made a \nhome in my garden. I walked out there one day with the intention of smoking a \ncigarette, sat on the rusty garden furniture that had come with the place, and \nlooked up. There it was – stretched between two large branches, silhouetted \nagainst the sky it sat. Objectively speaking the thing was tiny, couldn’t have \nbeen more than half an inch leg-to-leg, but up there, suspended high above \nme, its body black against the slate grey sky, it filled me with a sickening dread. \nI leapt up, and started to head back inside, but as I did my eyes flicked wildly \naround the rest of the garden, and everywhere they came to rest I saw more \nlurking spiders, more webs. There were dozens that I could see, which meant \nthere must be hundreds more I could not. \nThere was no way I could live there after that. How could I sleep knowing how \nmany crawling horrors moved and twitched and spun their filth just a wall \naway? I’m not a fool; I know that all gardens contain spiders. Every single one \nis filled with them, nestled in any crevice or hiding spot they can find. But now I \nknew. I had seen them in their spindly multitudes and I could not unknow how \nmany were there. And I could not stop thinking of when winter would come,", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 0, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 3105}}
