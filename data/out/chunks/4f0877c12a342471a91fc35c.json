Samson said they found asbestos, I heard it \nwas a lease issue, but it doesn’t really matter. Point is, they’d hired us for a job \nthat no longer existed. I expected they’d just get rid of us, but I mean, to their \ncredit, they did try to do right. They did their best to fit us in with other \nsecurity teams. Over the last two years, we did a couple of data centres, a \n“digital marketing hub”, whatever that is, and three different office buildings \nnear Kings Cross. Trouble was, every time, almost as soon as we got there, \nthere’d be some personnel changes or expiring contracts or some other \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 148 – Extended Surveillance \n \n13 \n \ntrouble, and generally, as the last in the door, we were the first to get \nreassigned. Started to feel a bit like we were cursed, you know? \nSamson took it harder than I did. I mean, I’m young, my mum’s got a flat in \nHackney, and, to be honest, most of my evenings are out with friends or in \nwith Black Ops, so the moving around was pretty much fine with me. Sam had \na three-year-old, though, and lived way down in Morden, so being thrown \nfrom one post to another all the time was really kind of getting to him. He tried \nto talk to me about it a few times, but honestly, we weren’t that close. Or \nrather, we were close because we’d always worked together, but we didn’t \nhave a huge amount in common. I mean, I tried to talk to him about football \nfor a while, but I think he could tell I was talking out of my arse. Anyway, point \nis, when we were reassigned to a shopping centre in Stratford, he wasn’t in a \ngreat place. \nNow, I’m not sure I can legally name the shopping centre I was working in to \nyou guys, but let’s just say it wasn’t the Westfield. It was old, clearly been \naround decades, and the security systems really showed it. I mean, one of the \nshops still had the original alarms from the late seventies, and plenty of them \nstill had cameras that recorded to VHS for God's sake. The security office was a \nmess. The company I worked for – again, don’t know if I can legally say them, \nbut you can look it up, you know – they have a package where they’ll replace \nall your equipment and systems with the stuff we use. It’s not cheap, but it’s \nworth it, if only cos we all know exactly how to use that stuff. \nWhoever was running this shopping centre had very much not opted for that \nparticular contract. I mean, the teams before us had made a valiant effort to \ncentralise and integrate all the feeds and set-ups into just the one control \nroom, but damn was that place a mess.
