It’s mostly helping students, but that’s all right. I think I’m done with \nresearch. \nARCHIVIST \nStatement ends. \nCan’t stand mosquitoes. Horrible things. Any solution to the issue of malaria \nthat doesn’t concentrate on wiping them out is not one that I have much time \nfor. Still, this grotesque account doesn’t give us many leads to follow. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG045 – Blood Bag \n8 \n \nObviously, there’s the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine itself, \nbut Tim’s investigation yielded little significant information. Apparently, those \nstaff who’ve been around long enough to remember the event, either didn’t \nknow the details or have been well briefed to keep their mouths shut. \nAside from the fact that Dr. Neil Thompson died in a lab accident on the 30th \nMay 2010, there’s little more to be found. Sasha managed to get a copy of the \ninquest report, which is… infuriatingly vague, but does list the cause of death \nas blood loss, and the official verdict as ‘death by misadventure’. \nI don’t think there can be much doubt that the antiques dealer is the curious \nMr. Salesa. He’s now turned up enough that I can no longer write it off as a \ncoincidence, and have been having a word with Rosie about whether we can \nmake contact with him. Apparently, he hasn’t been seen for almost two years \nnow, with rumours in the trade running to everything from ‘he had a quiet \nretirement’ to ‘he’s trying to dodge a jail sentence’, or even ‘he was shot dead \nin Colombia for stealing a priceless artefact from a drug lord’. Whatever the \nreason, it doesn’t look like he’ll be answering questions any time soon, though \nI have urged Rosie to keep trying. \nAside from that, there’s little more we can do with this statement. Mr. Neill \nhimself passed away last year. Martin hasn’t been able to get a hold of the \nofficial cause of death, but judging by the number of antibiotics the police \nreport list as being at his home at the time, it must have been something very \nnasty indeed. \nEnd recording. \n[Tape clicks off. Tape clicks on.] \nARCHIVIST \nSupplemental. \nI’ve been doing some digging into Tim, watching him. He’s certainly doing his \njob, far better than I’d have expected, given his recent experiences. There’s \njust one thing I don’t understand: why is he working for the Institute? A First in \nAnthropology from Trinity College, five successful years spent climbing the \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG045 – Blood Bag \n9 \n \nladder at a major publishing house, and then, out of the blue, he decides to \ncome work for us. \nWhy? I can’t find any other indication of an interest in the paranormal, nothing \nto indicate this area of study appealed to him. And why stay after everything \nthat happened with Prentiss? Is it just loyalty or could it be something – \n[The office door opens.] \nMARTIN \nHey, I just wanted to check if you wanted a cup of tea? \nARCHIVIST \nUh… \nMARTIN \nOh, oh, sorry, are you recording? I, I thought you were done for the day? \nARCHIVIST \nI-I was. I am. It’s… \nMARTIN \nWhy do you have pictures of Tim? \nARCHIVIST \nIt… it’s a performance review thing, going over some files for it. \nMARTIN \nBut that looks like a picture of his house? \n[Something rustles] \nARCHIVIST \nConfidential files that you… legally you shouldn’t really be looking at them. \nPlease, er, please leave, Martin. \nMARTIN", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 6, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 3683}}
