At this point, I at last decided to write the whole \nthing off and head back. It was as I turned to Luke to tell him this that my torch \ndied. \nThere was no fanfare, it just fizzled for a second, then turned off with a faint \npop. I looked over to Luke, about to ask him to pass me the spare batteries, \nwhen I saw his face. I don’t think I’ve ever seen anyone as scared as he was at \nthat moment. Then his torch went out as well and there was nothing but \ndarkness. \nI could hear him fumbling for something that I assumed were the camera lights \nand a second later I heard the click, click, click of him trying to turn them on. \nNothing happened. He kept clicking the switches, on and on, and I could feel \nhis desperation, but we were still trapped in the pitch black. Eventually he \nstopped and we just stood there. I wanted to say something reassuring, to \nreach out and let him know I was still there, but I was terrified of breaking the \nsilence. There was just his breathing, laboured and scared. I became aware of \nmy own breath, quick and betraying the panic I was trying to pretend I wasn’t \nfeeling. And then I heard it. The third set of breathing. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 063 – The End of the Tunnel \n \n9 \n \nIt was quiet, at first. Long and slow and very deliberate. The more I listened, \nthe louder it seemed to become, as though whoever was down here with us \nwas making sure we could hear it. And then another set of breaths joined it, \ndeep and throaty. And a fifth, a sixth, then more. We were surrounded on all \nsides by the sound of breathing, getting louder, getting closer. Luke let out a \nsmall whimper and all together they stopped. \nIn their place there came a scraping sound. Something metal, it sounded like, \nbeing dragged across the bricks. Far away behind us, but getting closer and \nfast, it was joined by a heavy, thumping tread, footsteps coming towards us, \nrhythmic and unhurried. I almost thought it could be my heartbeat, pounding \nin my ears, but the echo assured me it was coming from down the tunnel. Then \nthe scraping came again, now from the other direction, and I sank to the floor, \nclutching my camera to my chest like some sort of protective talisman. It was \nsilent, once again. \nThe noise that broke the stillness this time is the one that is still ringing in my \nears. It was far more dreadful than the others because of how familiar it was, \nthough I had never heard it in such a manner before. It was Luke’s voice and it \nwas screaming in agony. A shrill, gut-wrenching screech of pain and fear that \nwiped away all thought in a second and replaced it with blind panic. I wanted \nto run, but my legs had locked up.
