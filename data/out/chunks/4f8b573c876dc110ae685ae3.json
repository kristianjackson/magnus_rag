Sims was \ndifferent. He was insecure, aggressive, desperate to be taken seriously. Of \ncourse, having seen his file, Rosie kind of understood. Why on earth Mr \nBouchard had given him the job at all was a mystery to her, but it didn’t make \nit any easier to talk to him. \nHe was in the building, and she really should have called down, gotten him to \ncome up and sign off on the delivery. But if he dragged his feet, that would \nhave left her here with these two weird impressionists. And no doubt when he \nfinally did arrive there’d be some drama or other. No, she’d just sign for it, and \npass it on to Martin. He’d get it sorted out. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 192 – An Appointment \n \n19 \n[Writing sounds] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nBesides, she was kind of curious to see what was in the package. \n[Faint hissing static stops] \n[Intercom switch clicks with Panopticon reverb] \n[Office sounds cease; replaced by distant and muffled current-day \nLondon: helicopters and crowd screaming] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nIt is him behind it all. She’s certain. The words and noises that sometimes leak \nout of Mr Bouchard’s office are enough to convince her of that. Should she still \ncall him Mr Bouchard, knowing what she knows now about what it is that lives \ninside him, through him? She doesn’t really need to call him anything, of \ncourse. He hasn’t spoken to her since she clocked into the building. And there \nhaven’t been any visitors. She still smiles, though. Just in case. \n[Intercom switch clicks with office reverb] \n[Current-day London sounds stop; replaced by a fire alarm sound, \npeople excitedly talking, doors slamming] \n[Rosie takes several hurried footsteps in heels; Elias rustles some \npaper] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nHe didn’t even look up from his desk. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 192 – An Appointment \n \n20 \n“Everyone else is evacuating,” she yelled over the din of the fire alarm. Mr \nBouchard just smiled. \n“I wouldn’t worry about it, Rosie.” He shuffled his papers. “Just a little incident \ndown in the Archives. It’ll be dealt with soon enough.” \nSomething was wrong. He hadn’t had any calls. No-one had come by. There \nwas no way for him to know what was going on. But he said it with such \nconfidence. She turned and slowly walked back to her desk. \n[Rosie walks and sits on an office chair] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nSomething was going on, and Rosie wasn’t going anywhere until she knew \nwhat it was. \n[Running footsteps] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nWhen Sasha James barrelled past her without even glancing in her direction, \nRosie knew she’d been right to wait. \n[Muffled sound of Elias and Sasha arguing] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nShe moved quickly to the door, listening, looking around the edge. What were \nthey talking about? Worms? Like that weird infestation they had down there? \nHow is that an emergency? \nBehind his desk, without missing a beat of his conversation, Elias caught her \neye, and suddenly she was a child again— \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 192 – An Appointment \n \n21 \n[Alarm and argument sounds stop] \n[Floorboard creaks] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \n—creeping towards the rotten board in her parents’ attic, burning to know \nwhat lurked behind it, unsuspecting of the squirming nest of half-dead insect \nbodies she was about to reveal. \n[Rotten wood breaking, then insectile squelching, writhing, \ncrawling sounds] \n[Sudden stop of insectile sounds; replaced by fire alarm and Elias vs \nSasha argument] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nThen she was back in the office. Mr Bouchard was still smiling. And Rosie \nturned to run. \n[Running footsteps heading away] \n[Intercom switch clicks with Panopticon reverb] \n[Office sounds cease; replaced by distant and muffled current-day \nLondon: helicopters and crowd screaming] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nMaybe she could help, stuck here at the top of the impossible tower.
