Seriously? \n(The Archivist lets out a heavy sigh) \nARCHIVIST \nFine. \n[The backpack zippers jangle as they start walking] \nMARTIN \nOkay, good. \n(Beat) \nWhere are we going? \n(Beat) \nJohn? \n[The Archivist rings a doorbell] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 173 – Night Night \n7 \nMARTIN \nJohn, wait, a-are you, are you sure?— \n[The door squeaks as a young teenage boy opens it] \nCALLUM BRODIE \nYeah? What is it? \nARCHIVIST \nCallum Brodie? \nCALLUM \n(Lower) Yeah? \nMARTIN \nWait, is this..? \nARCHIVIST \nAre your parents home? \nCALLUM \nDad's dead. Mum's here, but she lost it a while back. So now it's just me. \nARCHIVIST \nDo you know who I am? \nCALLUM \nYou're the Eye guy, right? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 173 – Night Night \n8 \nARCHIVIST \nThat's right. \nCALLUM \nSo you're like, real important. \nARCHIVIST \n(Amused exhale) I suppose I am. \nCALLUM \n(Unimpressed) Okay. So. What do you want? \nMARTIN \nJohn, can I have a word? \nARCHIVIST \nSure. Excuse me, Callum. \n[Movement as Martin and the Archivist step aside to talk] \n[A child screams in the distance; the screams of children start to \ncome every-so-often now, becoming almost regular] \nMARTIN \n(Half-questioning) That's the Avatar for this place. \nARCHIVIST \nCallum Brodie, thirteen years old. He guides the children through their fears of \nthe Dark. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 173 – Night Night \n9 \nMARTIN \nThis is that kid Basira went after last year, right? The one the darkness cult \ntook. S-so that's not even a kid, that's whatever was inside Maxwell Rayner; it's \njust wearing his body. \nARCHIVIST \n(Calling) Callum! \n[Footsteps] \nCALLUM \nYeah? What? \nARCHIVIST \nYou remember when those people kidnapped you? What happened? \nCALLUM \n(Nonchalant) Mm it was fine. I just hid and the cops came and got me. \nARCHIVIST \nTell the truth. \n[Hissing static starts] \n(Callum makes a sound of discomfort) \nCALLUM \nI-I-I was, I was scared, alright? I was really, really scared. \n[Hissing static ends] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 173 – Night Night \n10 \nCALLUM (CONT'D) \nAnd it was da-dark, and I couldn't see anyone, and, I didn't know where I was, \nand, a-and there was something on my face and it was cold, a-and it was slimy. \nAnd it didn't like me. \nThen there was a bang, and it was gone. And, the police were there. \nARCHIVIST \nAnd what happened to the thing that tried to take you over? \nCALLUM \nDon't know, it… went away. \nARCHIVIST \nIt died in the light. \nCALLUM \nWhatever. \nARCHIVIST \nAnd it was after that you started shoving smaller kids into cupboards, right? \nCALLUM \nYeah, give them a taste of it. Make them afraid of the dark. \nARCHIVIST \nBut you've always pushed around smaller children, haven't you? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 173 – Night Night \n11 \nCALLUM \nThey made me feel sick. I hate them. \nARCHIVIST \nAnd now? \nCALLUM \nNow everyone's afraid of me. \n(Beat) \nARCHIVIST \nMartin? \nMARTIN \nFine, you've made your point. \nARCHIVIST \nThank you, Callum. \nCALLUM \n(Bored) Whatever. \nARCHIVIST \nIsn't it past your bedtime? \n(Callum scoffs) \nCALLUM \nI don't have a bedtime anymore. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 173 – Night Night \n12 \n[Callum shuts the door; Martin and the Archivist start walking] \nARCHIVIST \nYou see? \nMARTIN \nSee what, John; what am I supposed to see? That you don't want to kill a, \nthirteen year old kid? Big revelation. \nARCHIVIST \nI don't know what you want me to do. \nMARTIN \nI want you to use your power. I want you to help them; I want you to make \nthings better! \nARCHIVIST \nThere is no better anymore. \nMARTIN \n(Worked up) You keep- saying that, and I hate it! \nARCHIVIST \n(Worked up) I keep saying it because it keeps being true; you know that! \nMARTIN \nWhat I know, is that leaving children here is— (struggling) i-i-it's inexcusable, i-\nit's monstrous! \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 173 – Night Night \n13 \nARCHIVIST \n(Firm) Martin, tell me what you want me to do, and I will do it! \n(Beat) \nMARTIN \nTell me about this place. I need to know. \nARCHIVIST \nI thought you hated listen— \nAre you... sure that's what you want? \nMARTIN \n(Unhappy) Of course it's not. But I need to hear it. \nARCHIVIST \nOkay. \n[Hissing static starts] \nARCHIVIST \nSee Jack. See Jack run. Run, Jack. Run into the dark. \n[Hissing static ends] \n[Night birds, rusty squeaks, and screams continue] \nARCHIVIST \nDon't see Jack anymore.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 1, "chunk_count": 5, "chars": 4313}}
