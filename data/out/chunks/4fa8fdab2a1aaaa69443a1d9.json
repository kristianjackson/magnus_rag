Her \nvoice was soft and I couldn’t make out any of the words. I mean, I know I \nshouldn’t have been trying to listen – I know it’s a creepy thing to do – but you \ndon’t understand how momentous an occasion this was, to see this beautiful \nwoman whose name I still didn’t know finally talking to another human being. \nIt was incredible. The shorter woman’s voice was loud though and she made \nno attempt at subtlety in her conversation. She was talking about some sort of \njob and whether Agnes was going to be able to do it. \n \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG067 – Burning Desire \n \n5 \n \nAt first, I thought it was a job interview and then she started talking about \nAgnes being released from something. Agnes just said something softly and \nshook her head. She looked sad, an expression I’d never seen on her face \nbefore. The other woman sighed, clearly unhappy with the answer, and stood \nup to leave. Before she went, she took out a brown paper envelope and \nhanded it over, said that she’d give it to her now so she didn’t forget later. She \ncalled it a ‘collection’ and it looked like the envelope might have been full of \nmoney. Agnes put it in her jacket and returned to staring out the window, as \nher intimidating companion left with a frustrated expression. \n \nThat was the moment I decided to try and talk to Agnes. Seeing her interact \nwith someone else, even in such a weird way, unblocked something in my \nmind. The following Tuesday, when she came in and ordered her coffee, I \nasked her name. She looked at me in surprise, and for a second, I felt like I’d \nmade a terrible mistake, but then she told me, very matter-of-factly. And then \nI asked her out on a date. I don’t know how it happened, it just tumbled out of \nmy mouth before I could stop it. There was a moment of absolute silence, like \neveryone in the place had stopped breathing, though nobody had looked up. \nThen Agnes’ face twisted into something I think was a smile and she said yes. \n \nA wave of giddy joy just washed right over me, and she took her coffee and \nwent to her normal table. I could feel Dalia staring at me from the kitchen and I \ndidn’t want to turn around, because I knew exactly the face she’d be making \nand I was too happy to let her ruin it with her muttered predictions of disaster. \nIt was only after Agnes had left her undrunk coffee and headed out to \nwherever she went that I realised we’d never made any actual arrangements. \n \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG067 – Burning Desire \n \n6 \n \nI spent the next day in a funk, kicking myself for having been so stupid. I have \nWednesdays off work, so there was plenty of time to mope around the house \nfeeling sorry for myself. About three in the afternoon though, there was a \nknock on the door. Standing on the other side was Agnes. She was dressed in a \ndark woolen coat and grey scarf and had that same sort of smile on her face. \nShe asked if I was ready to go. I was very much not. I asked her to wait a \nminute as I ran back to my room to put on some deodorant and a clean shirt. It \nwas as I was doing this, I noticed kind of an odd smell, like when you turn on \nan electric heater for the first time in a while and you get a whiff of all the \nburning dust. I looked up and noticed that in the corner of the room, where \nthere had been a spider’s web this morning, there was just a faint wisp of \nsmoke. It was weird, but I had more important things on my mind. \n \nAs soon as I was ready, I headed out. I asked her what she wanted to do, and \nshe looked at me like I was stupid. We were going to walk in the park, she said, \nlike it was the only possible thing to do. Of course I agreed. She was the \nstrangest person I had ever met, but something about it just charmed me. So \nwe went down to Bolehill Park, the nearest one to my flat, and we walked. I \ndid most of the talking, as you might have expected. I don’t even remember \nhalf the things I said now, just a meaningless babble of thoughts, personal \ndetails and anecdotes. I worried I was boring her, but every time I looked over, \nshe had that same expression on, which by then I was pretty sure was a smile. \nI’d catch her eye and that feeling would flood through me. I still don’t know \nquite how to describe it, but whatever it was, it was powerful. \n \nWe sat on a bench as the sun went down, watching the sky red", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 2, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 4500}}
