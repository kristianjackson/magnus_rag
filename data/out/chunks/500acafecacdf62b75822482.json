I know how this must sound, but I feel it’s important you understand \nwhy I took him up to Tour Montparnasse in the first place. I couldn’t have \nknown what would happen. Deep down, though, in the hidden corners of my \nscepticism, I know it’s not my fault. I know it’s because of the man with the \nlightning scar. He did this. I don’t know how and I don’t know why, but he took \nmy brother away from me, and if I ever see him again, I’m going to kill him. \nThe first time we saw him was when I broke my arm. It was about a year ago, \njust after Halloween. \nWe’d both been out to a party the night before; I had managed to lose my \nkeys, and it was only as we approached our front door that Grant decided it \nwas the right time to announce he’d left his keys in the house, assuming I’d \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG075 – A Long Way Down \n4 \n \nhave mine. I was quite upset by this, and we had something of a row out there \nin the front garden, both of us yelling through blistering hangovers. We \ncouldn’t get a locksmith, as that would take hours and cost us a lot of money \nthat, with Grant unemployed and living with me, I did not have. After another \nfew minutes of recriminations, I spotted that Grant had left his window ever so \nslightly ajar. Normally I would have reminded him that leaving a window open \ninvites burglars, but in this case that was almost exactly what we wanted. \nI knocked on the door of the house next to ours. Jim Hancock was not the best \nof neighbours. He was the closest thing to a cartoon Cockney that I’ve ever \nmet, and had a habit of blasting music loud enough to bleed through the walls \nof our terraced house. He was, however, a builder, which meant that he would \nhave a ladder. He did and, after having a nice abrasive laugh at our situation, \nhe went and fetched it. He wasn’t interested in helping with the actual \nentrance to our home, and told us to leave the ladder in front of his garden, \napparently unconcerned by the prospect of thieves. \nObviously I was the one going up the ladder. We placed it in the garden, trying \nto get the end nestled in the crook of the window, and I started to climb. It was \nless stable than I had anticipated. Grant was gripping it at the bottom, but the \nground was softer than I thought, and as I reached for the window, I felt my \nstomach drop as the ladder pitched slowly to the side. I’d love to say that next \nthing I knew I was on the ground with a broken arm, but I remember every \nsecond of that fall. Like it was happening in slow motion. The rush of cold \nautumn air as I fell. The impact of my arm against the low brick wall. \nThe sickening crunch. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG075 – A Long Way Down \n5 \n \nI lay there, my arm in absolute agony, as Grant ran over to check on me. It was \nclear that the bone was broken and we needed to call an ambulance. My \nphone had been smashed in the fall, and when I asked Grant to use his, he got \nvery quiet and told me sheepishly that it, like his keys, was still inside the \nhouse. \nGrant started knocking on people’s doors but no-one answered. Maybe they \nweren’t home, or maybe they had heard our blazing row and didn’t want to \nhelp us. Even Jim didn’t seem inclined to open his door a second time. It was \nbecoming more and more clear that our only option was for Grant to climb in \nand get his phone, and I could see from his pale, frightened face that he had \ncome to the same conclusion. \nTo his credit, I didn’t have to talk him into it. My obvious agony seemed to do \nthat for me. He hoisted the ladder off the ground and pushed it close to the \nwindow. Then he stood there at the bottom, droplets of sweat visible on his \nface, and looked at me. He placed his foot on the lowest rung and began to \nclimb. It was slow and watching it was almost as painful as my shattered bone. \nHis neck was rigid, stiff with the will not to look down. He was barely ten feet \noff the ground, and every time the ladder shifted slightly he made a small \nsound of terror. He kept his face away from me but I think he might have been \ncrying. \nIt was as Grant was making his gradual ascent that I saw the man with the scar. \nHe was stood there, just across the street, watching us. He was short, and \nwore an old grey suit, faded with age, that didn’t seem to match his relatively \nyouthful face. He wasn’t wearing a tie, and the top two buttons of his shirt \nwere undone, revealing a jagged array of pale white scar tissue that seemed to \nclimb up the side of his nec", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 1, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 4500}}
