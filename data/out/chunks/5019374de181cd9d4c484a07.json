No, I, I know what you want. \nBut maybe you’re right. \n...No, that's— Martin’s right. \n[The Archivist stops walking] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nIt’s not worth it. \nWhy am I even talking to you? You don’t even have a mind, not really. That’s \nwhat you want, isn’t it? Something to be your focus, your will. Keeping you fed \nand placated and content! \n(Beat) \nYou got something to say? \nThen say it. \n[Hissing static starts] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nOf course. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 194 – Parting \n \n11 \n[Outdoor London sounds fade out; replaced by a humming fridge \nand the muffled sounds of street noise] \n[Clink of spoon stirring in a cup, then put down, followed by \ndrinking sounds] \n[Hissing static ends] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nThe old man was dead. The old man was dead, and Malcolm could feel nothing \nbut ice-cold relief washing over him. Every step he took seemed lighter. \n[A few footsteps] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nEvery breath seemed cleaner, as though he were walking through a bracing \nautumn evening. He knew he should be devastated, should be shattered by the \nloss of what had been the one constant in his life for as long as he could \nremember, but when his eyes passed over the stained and sagging armchair \nwhere the old man had sat, unmoving, for the last decade, the absence of that \nangular, judging face brought a smile to his lips. A smile of freedom. \n[Sounds of sitting down; continued drink sipping] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nAt last he could do what he liked. No prying questions when he walked in the \ndoor. No more knowing sneers, demanding to be told where he had been. No \nmore tiptoeing around his home in a desperate, futile attempt to avoid the \nsight of someone who, despite never seeming to move from that spot, seemed \nall too aware of Malcolm’s every private thought, his every dark impulse. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 194 – Parting \n \n12 \nWhat was the old man’s name again? Malcolm could barely recall. It didn’t \nmatter, though, no more than it mattered whether he had been a father, \ngrandfather, elderly friend, or even some sort of landlord. What mattered was \nthat for as long as he could remember — how long was that? — the old man \nhad sat on his threadbare throne, and held court over Malcolm’s life. And now \nhe was dead. The morticians had taken the body away — or at least, someone \nhad — and he had been the only one at the sad, overcast funeral. Now he was \nfree to live his life. \nTo live his life. What did that even mean anymore? What was there for him \nthat wasn’t simply avoiding the cruel barbs and snide judgements of the old \nman? Perhaps... love? \n[Sounds of getting up and walking] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nYes, perhaps now, without the wrinkled threat that chuckled from his armchair \nat any thought of his happiness, perhaps now he could find someone to spend \nhis life with. \n[Old computer button noise, crackling monitor, then mouse an \nkeyboard use] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nMalcolm fired up his old computer, which groaned to life with a sputter, the \nmonitor cracked and broken, and the keyboard stiff to the touch. For a \nterrifying moment it seemed as though it might not work at all, but finally the \nscreen lit up in a dull, sickly green. Malcolm clicked through until he found \nwhat he was looking for.
