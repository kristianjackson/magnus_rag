What struck me about him more than that though \nwere the scars on his neck. I later discovered they were from a dog attack \nwhen he was younger, but at the time, I was convinced they were connected \nto Dupont. \nSo, I found where Alard Dupont made his handovers in Piccadilly Gardens and I \nstarted to watch. He was surprisingly brazen about it, sat there on a park \nbench for hours, smoking or reading some magazine or other. I’d never seen a \nvampire read a magazine before, but I had seen them pantomime watching \ntelevision or reading a book to better blend in, so it didn’t raise any suspicions \nfor me. Then came the moment that fully convinced me that I had to kill \nDupont. \n\nThe Magnus Archives –056 – Children of the Night \n6 \n \nAs he sat there on the bench, two policemen walked past me, heading towards \nhim. They took no notice of me, nobody notices a tramp, but as they walked up \nthe path towards the figure on the bench, one of the police nudged his partner \nand gestured towards him. They clearly considered him suspicious and began \nto walk over. As they got close though, Dupont looked up and made eye \ncontact with them. They stopped, just for a moment, and he nodded gently. \nThe policemen looked at each other, turned, and walked away. \nThat was all I needed to be sure of what he was, and the idea I have come to \nsince, that the two police officers were simply on the take and hadn’t \nimmediately recognised him, didn’t occur to me until much later. It was an \novercast day and it seemed to me that Dupont was keeping in the shadows, \njust as I thought he would. I kept watching as he made a few more \ntransactions. I was craving a hit of my own by that point, but there was a much \nmore intense rush I was chasing just then and it pushed all thoughts of junk to \nthe back of my mind. \nEventually evening fell and I watched Dupont rise from his bench and make his \nway down into the town centre, keeping downwind of him and sticking to the \nshadows. Obviously, the darkness would be no impediment to him spotting \nme, but I’d learned that inconspicuous as a homeless man might be, it’s still \nalways best to be seen by as few witnesses as possible. I figured he was \n\nThe Magnus Archives –056 – Children of the Night \n7 \n \nheading towards a nightclub or dancehall, a favourite haunt of the vampire, \nsince the loud music makes their lack of speech that much easier to hide. I was \nright, in as far as he headed towards The Hacienda, one of the loudest clubs in \nManchester. It wasn’t as notorious then as it would later become, in fact I \nthink it had only recently opened when all this happened, but even at its worst, \nit would probably have drawn the line at allowing me entrance, given the state \nI was in. So, I watched Dupont head inside, adopting my camouflage of softly \nasking passers-by for change, and waited. \nIt was about two hours later that he emerged, another man following close \nbehind him. I didn’t recognise them. I mean, there is no reason I should have, \nbut Dupont’s new friend was almost as big as he was. Vampires tend to go for \nthe smaller victims, those less able to defend themselves should the initial \nsurprise of their attack not be enough. This one really looked like he could take \ncare of himself. Still, as far as I was concerned, he had no idea what was about \nto happen to him, and as Dupont led him down a nearby alley, I hurried after \nthem. \nI was quiet as I limped through the rubbish that covered the alleyway and I \nsilently drew my trusty hammer. After a minute, they turned into a doorway \nand took out a key. The door opened and they both stepped inside.
