Does that thing even work? It must be thirty years old. \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nI know, but we have previously had some success using it to record statements \nthat our… digital recording software struggles with. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG013 – Alone \n2 \n \n \nNAOMI \nYeah, well that’s one way to put it. You need to get some better equipment. \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nBelieve me, I have been trying. Still, the tape recorder seems to work fine as a \nbackup, and I can have it transcribed later, so for now if you’d be so kind… \n \nNAOMI \nYou’re serious? You actually want me to tell my story into that rattling piece of \njunk? I see why no-one takes you guys seriously. \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nYou’re under no obligation to speak to us. \n \nNAOMI \nNo, I just... I guess I’m just desperate. The last paranormal investigator I went \nto laughed at me when I suggested talking to you. Still, I-I guess you have to \nbelieve me. \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nSomething like that. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG013 – Alone \n3 \n \n \nNAOMI \n(sighs) Okay, from where we left off? \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nProbably best to start over. Name, date, subject, et cetera. I’m not optimistic \nthat any of the previous recording will be salvageable. \n \nNAOMI \nFine. My name is Naomi Herne, and I’m making a statement about the events \nfollowing the funeral of my fiancé, Evan Lukas. The date is the 13th of January \n2016. To be honest I’m not even sure I should be here. What happened was \nweird and, alright, I can’t think of a rational explanation for it, but I was \ndistraught. I still am. I should go. I probably just imagined the whole thing. He’s \ngone and that’s all there is to it. \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nThat’s certainly possible. It might all be in your head, though there is the \nmatter of the stone. \n \nNAOMI \nThat could be... I don’t know. I just don’t know what to think. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG013 – Alone \n4 \n \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nTake your time. \n \nNAOMI \nWait, where are you going? \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nI was going to give you some privacy while you make your statement. \n \nNAOMI \nOk, it’s just... could you stay please? I don’t want to be alone. \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nVery well. Let’s start from the beginning. \n \nNAOMI \nAlright. I guess the beginning would be when I met Evan. I’ve never really been \nthe social type. I’ve always been more comfortable alone, you know? My \nfather died when I was 5 years old and my mother spent so much time working \nto keep us fed that I hardly ever saw her. I wasn’t bullied in school or anything \nlike that. I mean, to be bullied you need to be noticed and I made sure that I", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 0, "chunk_count": 9, "chars": 3030}}
