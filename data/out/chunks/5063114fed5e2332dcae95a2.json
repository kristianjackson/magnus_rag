I didn’t mind being alone, though, \nbecause I knew I had my little boy Ethan waiting for me back at home. Four \nyears old and already sharp as anything. And my wife Lucy. She used to be \nwaiting for me as well. \nYou see… plenty of strange things out here. That far from anywhere, a lot of \nfolks use it as their own personal dumping grounds. Fridges, microwaves, \nbarbed wire, all sorts. Occasionally strewn throughout the forests and over the \nhills. I even found a corpse once. Not as exciting as it sounds – they were far \ntoo decomposed for me to tell anything about the death. Could have been a \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG037 – Burnt Offering \n6 \n \nmafia hit or could have been a hiker having a heart attack. Result was the same \nfor me: radio it in and then lose two hours of light babysitting a dead guy while \nI wait for someone to get up and take charge of it. \nSo when I saw the clearing in the trees near Loch Glass I wasn’t worried. I \nfigured I’d seen everything messed up the forest had to offer. Heck, I even saw \na friend of mine get impaled on a falling tree once. I reckoned there was \nnothing left to shock me. It didn’t matter that the hairs on my arm began to \nstand up, or that I started sweating through my coat in the middle of February, \nor that that dry acrid taste at the back of my throat made me want to gag. I still \nheaded on over to investigate this odd-looking clearing. \nIt wasn’t man made, or at least nobody had cut trees down to make it. It \nlooked as though the trees had been deliberately planted in a circle. If that was \nthe case, judging by their growth they must have been planted like that almost \nfifty years ago. In the centre was a large piece of stone, crudely hacked into \nwhat looked like a small seat or… maybe an altar. As I stood there on the edge, \nI realised the trees around me were completely silent, and after a few seconds \nof examination saw that it didn’t look like there were any animals at all around \nthis clearing. It was… unsettling, sure, but it also meant that I had all the \ninformation I needed for my survey of that area. I could tick the boxes and \nmove on. I didn’t need to enter the clearing. But I did. \nThe moment I crossed that threshold I knew I had made a mistake. It was like \nan electric shock rushing through my body, and my already warm skin began to \nprickle and burn. I stripped off my jacket with sweat dripping from my fingers, \nand reached for my water to try and get rid of that foul taste in my throat. I \npulled the cap off and took a long swig… half a second before I realised the \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG037 – Burnt Offering \n7 \n \nwater was boiling hot. I screamed; well, it was more a gurgle, really, and fell to \nthe floor in agony. \nI lay there for almost half an hour, collecting myself and just breathing in the \ncold winter air of the Highlands, waiting for the pain to die down. Eventually, I \nmanaged to compose myself and stagger to my feet. The strange sensations \nwere still there, but I was able to mostly choke them down, at least until I had \na proper look around the clearing. The altar was the focus of the whole thing, \nbut in many ways it was the least interesting part. Clean, smooth stone. No \nmarkings of any sort, nothing on top. Just… a rock. Around it, though, on the \nground were scorch marks. They didn’t seem to radiate out from any one \nangle, they just covered areas of the forest floor. There was no ash, though, or \ndebris, or anything that might have meant a fire, just the burn marks. \nIt was following these scorches that led me to the really messed up stuff, \nbecause what I saw around the edges of the clearing put them to shame. See, \nit looked like there were animals in that place once, but now each one lay just \nbeyond the edge. On all of them, the fur or feathers had been burned away, \nand all that was left was their skin, scalded a vivid, angry red, like they’d been \nbadly sunburned. They were dead, every one of them, though none seemed to \nhave decayed any more than their compatriots. Either they had all died \ntogether, or something in that place was keeping them fresh. Neither option \nsounded grand to me. \nFinally, I looked at the trees. There was nothing wrong with the trees \nthemselves, not exactly. Driven into the trunk of each one was a heavy-looking \niron nail. I didn’t count how many there were in total, maybe a couple dozen. \nEach suspended", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 2, "chunk_count": 5, "chars": 4500}}
