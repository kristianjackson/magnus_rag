Gavin? and suddenly, hey, it’s a date. And I really didn’t want his first \nimpression of me to be, you know, me yelling at some creeper in the corner. So \nI just swap chairs so that I’ve got my back to your ‘colleague’, and get on with \nit. \nDidn’t really matter, you know, in the end, Gareth was a, was a bust. You \nknow, not like, you know, I mean... He, he was fine, I guess, it’s just there was \nnothing really there between us. You know? Just a nice, boring coffee with a \nkinda dull man. Took about an hour and he clearly wasn’t feeling it either, so \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 142 – Scrutiny \n \n7 \n \nwe, you know, we just called it. I mean, we actually shook hands when he left, \nwhich... I mean, tells you something, right? \nSo… Look, I’m packing up, all done and, and I just, I just sorta turn, you know, \njust, just to check if he’s still there and he is standing right behind— Like, like a \nfew inches from my face. Look, it’s messed up! \nAnd I start to ask him, you know, what the hell, man, you know? Like— But he \njust starts talking. Slowly. But real intense. He says, he works here, at the, the \nMagnus Institute, and I say, what even is that and he says, he wants my story. \nHe says he needs to hear what happened to me. And I— I want to tell him to j-\nj-just go away. I want to, to, to kick him and run. But I— (long sigh) I sit down. \nAnd I start to tell him everything. About the job, about the collapse, a-about \nthe hand. More than I told you, even, and, and as I do— it’s like I’m there \nagain. Like I can feel it grab my ankle, th-th-that cold, dead hand and I just… I \njust can’t stop talking. I cannot shut up. \nMARTIN \nAre you alright? \nBYSTANDER \n(Distressed) No! No I’m not! Of course I’m not. It felt like, like I was throwing \nup all those feelings again, and I wanted to, to scream but instead I just sat and \ncalmly told him my life story. And he just watched me, his eyes like... His eyes \nwere, were like drinking in every fragment of my misery. I can’t— It— \nAnd then it was over. And he looked— He looked at me like he’d just eaten, \nlike a perfectly cooked steak. You know what he said? He said, “Thank you.” \n“Thank you.” Just like that. Like, like reliving the worst parts of my whole life \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 142 – Scrutiny \n \n8 \n \nwere just a bit of a… a favour that I’d done him. And then he left and I— I just \nsat there and cried for a while. \n[Sniffs wetly] \nThat wasn’t the end. \nMARTIN \nYou… You’ve seen him since? \nBYSTANDER \nNo. Not— Kind of? I feel like I do. \nI’ve been... dreaming of that tunnel again. Nightmares. Oh godawful \nnightmares. Nightmares where the, where the hand keeps pulling and I go \ndeeper and deeper and, and deeper into... It takes me places I do not want to \ngo. And he’s there the whole time, just... watching me. Watching me scream \nand thrash and... He’s all eyes. He’s all eyes. \nLook, I know that’s not— That’s my brain. I’m not blaming him for being in my \ndreams. You know, I guess I can’t— (sniffs) That’s absurd, right? It’s not— \nBut I feel like I’m seeing him when I’m awake as well. I’ve been... I’ve been \nhaving a lot of problems since he talked to me. Since I talked to him. Since I \ntold him my story. The, the claustrophobia, it’s back, worse than it ever was \nand I can’t do my job. I have these, these screaming panic attacks every time I \ntry and— \nWhat am I supposed to do? Like, feels like, like every time I’m even slightly \nunderground I— Can’t even go into a shop basement more without feeling", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 2, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 3636}}
