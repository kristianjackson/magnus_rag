It was either very dirty or painted a \nnasty shade of off-white. Most importantly, it was driving about 25 miles an \nhour. The limit is 70. There’s technically no minimum speed on a motorway, \nbut the van didn’t show any signs of speeding up and it was kind of strange. \nWe had enough cause to stop it if we wanted. I wasn’t sure whether to let it go \nor not, but Zac had clearly made his decision already. He was in the driving \nseat, and fired up the lights as we drove up behind it. The van glided to a stop \non the hard shoulder at the side of the road and sat there. The headlights, \nwhich had been turned on for the rain, died. Then it just waited. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 061 – Hard Shoulder \n \n12 \n \nZac was out first. The rain was so thick that he had to take his torch to see \nproperly. The light passed over the van and I could see rust creeping around \nthe edges of the panelling. We walked up to the driver’s side. I could see dark \nshapes from inside, but they weren’t moving. Up close, I could read the name \non the side, ‘Breekon and Hope Deliveries’. It was covered in a thick layer of \ndirt that the rain couldn’t quite wash off. \nZac knocked on the door and it opened. The man who got out looked normal. \nSo normal that these days I can’t really picture his face. Said his name was \nTom. I wasn’t the one looking over his driving licence, so I don’t know about \nsecond names. From the other side, two men climbed out. They were huge. \nHard faces, like a pair of old stone statues, dressed in overalls and flat caps. \nThey asked what was going on, speaking back and forth in Cockney accents so \nbroad and fake sounding that I thought they were putting them on for a laugh. \nI was about to lay into them for it when a sound cut me short. Zac had been \ntalking to ‘Tom’, who was making some bland explanation for this slow driving: \ncaution, heavy rain, empty road, all that crap. But they heard it too, and he \nstopped mid-sentence to look at me. From the back of the van, there was a \nsound of moaning. \nIt sounded like... kind of like a moan of pain, but long and drawn out. It went \non for almost a full minute and was almost... I don’t know, kind of musical? I \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 061 – Hard Shoulder \n \n13 \n \nlooked at Tom and the fake Cockney passengers, but their faces were \nunreadable. Zac gripped Tom firmly by the arm and led him to the rear doors \nof the van, demanding that he open it. He didn’t resist, just nodded and got \nout a set of keys. He put one of them in the door, turned it, and the van \nopened. I saw that the two big guys had walked up next to us, so I was getting \nready for trouble, but there’s no way I would have guessed what was in there. \nIt was a coffin: an old, wooden coffin, rough, unvarnished. I could see splinters \nwhere the nails had been hammered in badly. Wrapped all around it was a \nthick metal chain, ending in a heavy padlock. That weird moaning was coming \nfrom inside it. It was the only sound that cut through pounding rain. \nI tensed up, reaching my baton. If these people were kidnappers or worse, we \nwould be in big trouble. I was ready for a fight, but they just stood there, not \nmoving, staring at us. Everything about the situation felt wrong. I looked over \nat Zac and he seemed to be thinking the same thing. He looked over at the two \nmen in overalls and told them to take it out, then looked over to Tom, asking if \nhe had a key to the padlock. Reaching into his jacket, the man who called \nhimself Tom pulled out a large iron key and handed it to my partner. It didn’t \nlook like the other keys. I wanted to head back to the car and call in some \nback-up, but Zac was a senior officer and if he thought we should open it first, I \nwas going to back his play.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 2, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 3803}}
