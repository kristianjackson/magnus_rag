The only two things I knew for sure was that I had never \nbeen as scared as I was just then, and that I did not know this man. \nWhen evening finally came, he stood up. He nodded at me and told me how \nmuch he had enjoyed his visit. “We must do this again,” he said, “and soon.” \nThen he left. I stayed sat in that chair and I cried. \nIt was full dark when I was broken out of my despair by another knock on the \ndoor. This one was harsh and jarring, and I could hear the doorframe rattle \nslightly at the impact. Standing there was another man I’d never seen before. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG078 – Distant Cousin \n7 \n \nHe was black, dressed in a crisp white shirt with the sleeves rolled up, and a \nthin necktie. \nFor a moment, I had the idea he might be a Jehovah’s Witness, but one look at \nhis face dispelled that idea immediately. It was hard and stern, set in look of \ndetermination, and his short hair was iron grey. He was very thin, with aging \nskin stretched tight over wiry, corded muscle, and though he was slightly \nshorter than I was, it seemed like he towered over me. He asked if I knew the \nman who had left my house earlier that evening. \nI laughed at that; a harsh laugh that surprised even me. I said I did not know \nhim, no matter how many pictures might tell me I did. At this, the old man’s \neyes lit up with excitement, and I took an involuntary step back. If he noticed, \nhe didn’t show it, walking past me into the house and ordering me to get any \nphotos that hadn’t changed. I don’t know if it was the certainty in his voice or \nmy own feeling of helplessness, but it didn’t even occur to me not to do what \nhe said. \nI returned from the loft with the box of photographs to find him sat on the \nsofa, exactly where my impostor cousin had sat not two hours before, and I \nfinally got up the courage to ask him who he was. He told me his name was \nAdelard Dekker, and that he was an exorcist, of sorts. I asked him if he thought \nmy cousin was somehow possessed, but he was already looking through the \nbox, and ignored me. He pulled out the same two photographs I had found, the \nones that hadn’t changed, and his mouth twisted into a wry smile. \nHe told me to follow him, and I did. We walked over to an unmarked blue \nTransit van parked on the other side of the road, and he opened the back \ndoors. Inside was a large wooden box with a hinged lid. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG078 – Distant Cousin \n8 \n \nThe man who called himself Adelard Dekker climbed in and picked up the back \nof it, commanding me to take the other end. I did, and together we carried it \ninto my house. It was heavy and barely fit through the front door, but any \nobjections I might have had were silenced by one look from Dekker. We placed \nit down in the middle of the living room, and I instinctively went to lift the lid. I \ncaught a brief glimpse of dark, varnished wood before he slammed it down, \nalmost trapping my hand, and shook his head once. “It’s not for you,” he said. \nThen he instructed me to go to my bedroom, and not to leave until he told me \nit was safe. I did protest at that, and I asked him how my locking myself \nupstairs would help save Carl. There was no sympathy in his voice when he \ntold me my cousin was dead, that nothing would bring him back, and that my \nbest chance to not join him was to stay in the bedroom until everything was \nover. He did not seem inclined to tell me what he meant by “everything”. \nSo I did what he said. I suppose I could have called the police, but this strange, \nold man spoke with such certainty that I felt like following his instructions was \nthe only hope I had. I lay in my bed and I tried to sleep. I did, though not well. \nThe image of this new Carl kept intruding in my dreams and jolting me awake. \nThe sun came up, and there was no word from Dekker, so I stayed there, \nwaiting for something to happen, though I had no idea what. I lay in bed all \nmorning and then into the afternoon. \nFinally, at about three o’clock, I heard the soft knock at the door. It was the \nexact same knock at the exact same time, and I felt my body seize up with fear. \nThere was the sound of the door opening, but nothing else. I just lay there, \nstraining my ears to hear any sound. The air grew close and heavy, like a \nthunderstorm about to break, but still I heard nothing. Ten minutes passed. \nThen an hour.
