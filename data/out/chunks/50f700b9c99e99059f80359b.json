The air was colder here, suffused with the \nfaint tang of rot, and I began to wonder how much battery I had in my torch. I \nhad put a fresh one in before my expedition, I’m not stupid, but the more I \nthought about it, the more I realised that I don’t actually know how long \nbatteries last for continuous use in a heavy-duty torch. I hadn’t even been \ndown there an hour, but already it felt like the light it cast was weaker, \nsomehow, and I realised how unsure I was of my exact route back. I decided I \nwould rather cut my first trip unnecessarily short than risk being trapped down \nthere without light. So I turned back. \nIt was almost impossible to retrace my steps. I tried to remember my route \nusing what vague oddities I could remember as landmarks: a burned door, a \nparticularly warped corridor. But trying to find them again was useless in the \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG041 – Too Deep \n6 \n \nwinding passages. In my increasing panic to find the way out, I almost forgot \nthe things I had originally gone down there to look for. Then I found the circle \nof worms. \nWhen Tim had first described it, I had only half-believed him. I’m sorry, Tim, if \nyou’re listening, but the CO2 had done some strange things to you at that \npoint. He had the right of it, though. By the time I found it, there was little left \nbut a thick carpet of dead worms, but a few were still embedded in the wall \nproviding the clear outline of a circle. The ceiling was higher here, and all told it \nmust have been about… ten feet in diameter. Its size was not the most \ndisconcerting thing though. Inside the circle, the stone was... wrong somehow. \nSolid, but oddly wavy, like chocolate that’s melted and then rehardened. It \ntook me a minute or two to work up the courage to wade through that shallow \nsea of filth, but I did, and when I touched the warped wall, it felt soft and \nporous. But stable. I turned and left, but not before noting that another path \nalso appeared to have been pushed through the worms on the floor, though \nwhen it had happened or who had made it I couldn’t say. \nIt took me almost another hour to find the trapdoor again. My torch showed \nno signs of giving up, but I was still on the verge of panic. My hands were so \nslick with sweat that I fumbled several times with the handle before finally \npushing it open bodily, and falling through onto the floor of the Archives. It \nwas about three in the morning by that time. I had managed to reopen a few \nof my partially healed wounds, so I headed home to rest. \nIt turned out the trip had taken far more out of me than I thought; it was \nalmost a week before I felt like I might be up for another excursion. This time, \nhowever, I decided that I was not going to take any chances: I packed three \ntorches, with enough replacement batteries to last for days, food and water in", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 3, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 2857}}
