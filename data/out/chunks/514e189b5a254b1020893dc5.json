I lowered myself slowly to the \nground, trying to collect my thoughts, considering the thing I had just \ndiscovered with my clumsy, reckless digging. \nI wanted to call the police immediately, but I don’t have a mobile phone, and it \nwas a little bit of a walk to the nearest phonebox. My legs wouldn’t stop \nshaking when I tried to stand up, so I sat there for a while, my torch shining on \nthat lifeless hand, trying to compose myself enough to go get help. It was an \nodd thing, that hand. The fingers were bent and bloody, and the nails had been \nchipped and broken. From the looks of it, the damage had happened before its \nowner had passed away. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG088 – Dig \n9 \n \nThen I noticed something else in the sand next to it. Something protruding \never so slightly from the sand I’d already disturbed. It didn’t seem like part of \nthe body, and I found myself reaching over to try and pull it up. It slipped out \nof the sand easily, eagerly even, and I didn’t even need to dig. \nIt was a book. The cloth of the cover had worn away, and it was still wet from \nthe seawater that covered the area at high tide. I expected it to be a useless \nlump of wet paper mush, fused together and unreadable, but when I pulled it \nopen the pages came apart easily. There was a label at the very front, but the \nink had run and I have no idea what it might have said. So I turned to the first \npage. \nIt was very strange. It was just the one word, solid capital letters in a small, \nneat typeface at the very centre of the page. It said ‘DIG’. I took that to be the \ntitle, and turned to the next page. ‘DIG’. Exactly the same. The third page. \n‘DIG’. The fourth page. ‘DIG’. Dig, dig, dig, dig. \nHolding it hurt my hands. You know the way that if you say or read a word over \nand over again, it starts to lose all its meaning? To just sound like a jumble of \nnoises or unrelated letters? Well this was the opposite. Every time I read it, it \nwas like the meaning of the word became more solid in my mind. I knew what \nit was to find your meaning buried in the earth, to claw your sense from under \nthe sand and mud and soil, to dig. \nI had almost completely unearthed the body when the police arrived. \nApparently a late-night jogger had spotted the scene, and called them. They \nbelieved me when I explained to them how I had found it, though they were \nnone too pleased that I had so thoroughly ruined what may well have been a \ncrime scene. I don’t think it was, and one of the friendlier officers later told me \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG088 – Dig \n10 \n \nthe man had probably dug himself too deep a hole in the beach, and it had \ncollapsed on him when the tide had come in. A tragedy, but not unheard of. \nThey still weren’t pleased with me, though, and once they had my statement I \nwas sent on my way. The book was in my bag, and they didn’t ask to look \ninside, so… I kept it. I probably should have mentioned it to the police, but they \nwere very rude. I understand now, of course, that they were simply irritated \nthat I had robbed them of their opportunity to dig. \nPerhaps they sensed it, that need inside of us. Above us, you see, there’s only \nthe sky, the infinite, a void of space and emptiness so incredible that to think \nof it in detail is to overwhelm the mind. But down, down into the earth. \nThrough the many layers of this globe, this sphere built and crusted upon a \nsingle, beating point. The centre of the universe for each and every one of us, \nthat glorious convergence from which everything, everywhere, is ‘up’. To reach \nit, to approach that source, that rolling, molten centre of it all, the only thing \nyou have to do is dig. \nI’ve dreamed of it, of course. Safe and happy below, wrapped on all sides by \nuncounted miles of crushing, loving, earth and stone. I see it, and watch the \npassing of history build upon it, layer after layer. To travel down into the \nground is to travel through time, that’s what I always used to say, before I \nfound my book. And I still believe it, but time is the least of the things that \nwaits for us down there, things I can barely think of without collapsing in fear. \nA thousand terrible things, trapped and alone, out of air and out of light, all \ncontained within those three hideous letters: DIG. \nIn those dreams I hold a spade. It screams when I plunge it into the weeping \nsoil, and the voice it cries out with is my own.
