Tell me, why are you here? \n[The Panopticon background noises & static continues] \nARCHIVIST \nI... I don’t know. \nJONAH/ELIAS \nWere you drawn here? \nARCHIVIST \nYes. I was. \nJONAH/ELIAS \nAgainst your will? \nARCHIVIST \nNo. \nJONAH/ELIAS \nThen why did you heed the call? \nARCHIVIST \n(With Panopticon room reverb) Because... this is the place I know I should be. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 193 – A Stern Look \n \n18 \nJONAH/ELIAS \nGood. \nThe job is yours. \n[The background echoes of the Panopticon fades out; the \nbackground constant pulse now starts rising in loudness; with the \nunpleasant shifting tone joining it] \n[Hissing static ends] \n [Strange high-pitched static sound for a few seconds] \nARCHIVIST \nElias has the briefest of flashes, a sudden burst of terror, an image of himself, \nstrapped down, helpless. The vanishing of well-known faces, and the harsh \nsneers that replace them as they stare at him. He cannot move. He cannot \nscream. What is happening? What is it that he feels deep down in his skull? \n[Faint squelchy gore sounds] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nWhat are they doing to his eyes? This presence, old and rotten, in his mind? \nHe can do nothing but watch. \n[Gore sounds and shifting tone stop, while pulse returns to the \nbackground; Elias’ ticking clock resumes] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nThe moment passes, and Elias returns to himself. \n[Hissing static starts] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 193 – A Stern Look \n \n19 \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nHe tries to smile, and thanks his new employer for the opportunity. \n[Elias’ office clock fades out; sound transitions to the Panopticon \nambience] \n[Hissing static fades] \n[Jonah resumes his position skyward, recommencing his chanting \nnarrative] \nJONAH/ELIAS (BACKGROUND) \n…as they look down to see the pitch black void of ocean getting darker still as \nsomething rises up that dwarfs the sky and yet they know it is the smallest tip \nof only one appendage reaching up splitting timber splitting steel splitting \nfriends all into shapes and forms and spatters that don’t register as human \neven as the inky frozen sea pulls air out of their lungs because it is so cold it is \nso cold it is so coldly sneering as sticky strands pull taut against the flailing \nstruggles as they try to pull away from what approaches in the distant edge of \nthis colossal latticework of bone and sickly paste that twists and curls with \neach vibration of those fools like them now caught and wrapped and flailing in \ntheir heaving desperation not to see it looming over them with glassy eyes and \nfangs that drip with poison and the promise of the slow and steady agony of \nfeeling all that was herself dissolved and broken down into the bitter \npleading— \nMARTIN \nYou alright? That was... intense. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 193 – A Stern Look \n \n20 \nARCHIVIST \nYeah… uhh… I just… uhh... \nMARTIN \nWas that the real Elias? Is he still in there then? \nARCHIVIST \nNo... No. It-it was... an echo. The last spasm of a corpse. I-It’s far too late for \neither of them. \nMARTIN \nDamn. \nARCHIVIST \nThere was never anything we could have done. But I-I saw… \nMARTIN \nWhat? \nARCHIVIST \nYou were right. \nMARTIN \nA-about what? \nARCHIVIST \nHis body is vulnerable. At least to me. \n(Beat) \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 193 – A Stern Look \n \n21 \nMARTIN \nWhat’s the catch? \nARCHIVIST \nI could kill his body, sever the link, break The Eye’s power, and Jonah Magnus \nwould die. \nMARTIN \nOkay, that sounds good, but...? \nARCHIVIST \nBut, that wouldn’t actually harm The Eye itself. And with him gone it would... \nIt would choose a suitable replacement. \nMARTIN \nOh. \nARCHIVIST \nIf we kill Jonah Magnus, I take his place. \nMARTIN \nOh god. \nARCHIVIST \nAnd I think... \n…that’s exactly what it wants. \n[Tape clicks off]", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 6, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 4064}}
