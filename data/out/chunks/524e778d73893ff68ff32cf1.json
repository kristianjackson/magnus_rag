What are you doing? \nMARTIN \nI'm... saying no. I refuse. Game over. \n[The knife clatters to the ground] \nPETER \nMartin, this is not the time for petulance. There are bigger things at stake here. \nMARTIN \n(Laugh) You know, I think that was actually the problem. You made the stakes \ntoo high. All the little details that didn't add up... it made them more obvious. \nExaggerated. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 158 – Panopticon \n \n30 \nPETER \nThe Extinction is coming. \nMARTIN \nOh, I'm sure it is! But that's not what this is about, is it? This isn't about saving \nthe world, it's all just some power play against him. I might not know exactly \nwhat's going on, but I don't think I want any part of this. However much I want \nto kill him... I'm out. \nPETER \nBut you said— \nMARTIN \nHonestly, I mostly just said what I thought you wanted to hear. \nPETER \nI see. \nThis is your doing, is it? \nELIAS \n(Amused) Hardly. \nMARTIN \nIt's not him! It's not anybody. It's just me. Always has been. I... \nWhen I first came to you, I thought I had lost everything. John was dead, my \nmother was dead, the job I had put everything into had trapped me into \nspreading evil and I... I really didn't care what happened to me. I told myself I \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 158 – Panopticon \n \n31 \nwas trying to protect the others, but honestly we didn't even like each other. \nMaybe I just thought joining up with you would be a good way to get killed. \nAnd then... John came back, and... and suddenly I had a reason. I had to keep \nyour attention on me. Make you feel in control so you didn't take it out on him. \nAnd if that meant drifting further away, so what? I'd already grieved for him \nand if it meant now saving him, it was worth it. \nWhen you started talking about the Extinction, though... you had me actually, \nfor a while. But then, (laughs sardonically) then you tried to make me the \nhero. Tried to sell me on the idea that I was the only one who could stop it. \nAnd that… that never sat right with me. I mean, I mean, look-look at me, I'm \nnot exactly a, a-a chosen one. But, by then I was in too deep. So I played along. \nWaited to see what your end game was, and here we are. \nFunny. Looks like I was right the first time. It's probably still a good way to get \nkilled. \nELIAS \n(Smugly) I warned you, Peter. \nPETER \nBut you do serve the Lonely. \nMARTIN \nOh, I'm getting there, but, if this is the final test or something? Then bad luck. \nThe answer's still no. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 158 – Panopticon \n \n32 \nPETER \n(Petulantly) No. No! This isn't fair— do you have any idea what you've done? \nYou knew, he must realize— \nMARTIN \nElias— Jonah had nothing to do with it. \nPETER \nNo, that's not— you can't— \nELIAS \n(Extremely pleased) You've lost, Peter, admit it. (small chuckle) He played you \nlike a... like a... (pleased) cheap whistle. \nPETER \nNo! Shut up. \nELIAS \nPeter. It's time. \nPETER \nFine! \n[The Lonely static suddenly crescendos as Martin speaks; when it \nfades back to a faint level Martin is gone] \nMARTIN \n(Fading out) Great. Now perhaps one of you, then, can tell me what's... \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 158 – Panopticon \n \n33 \nELIAS \nIt won't be that bad, Peter. (small chuckle) You'll see. Now, he'll be here soon, \nso you can leave or— \nPETER \nOh, no. No. I'm not gonna make it easy on him. You haven't won yet. \nELIAS \nYour choice. Just make sure to leave the door open. \n[The Lonely static rises again, before becoming faint] \n(Elias lets out a long, triumphant laugh, then sighs, contented) \n[Tape clicks off] \n[Tape clicks on] \n[Faint sound of the Lonely static] \n[A large echoing space; the panopticon; footsteps] \n(A few seconds of John's laboured breathing) \nELIAS \nAh, John. I was almost worried. You found your way all right? \nARCHIVIST \n(Out of breath) Yes. Y-yes, I did. \n...How?", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 5, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 4125}}
