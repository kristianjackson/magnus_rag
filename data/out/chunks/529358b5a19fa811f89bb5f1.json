It was as I reached for the phone that I looked at my hands and saw \nthat what was on them was not sweat. It was blood. I checked all over my \nhands and arms for cuts or injuries. Nothing. And the door handle was \ncompletely clean. I washed my hands thoroughly before I dialled 999. \nThe police came and they listened patiently to my story. They checked all \naround my house, but there were no signs of any intruder. All the windows and \ndoors were still firmly locked and there was no sign of forced entry, nor had \nany of my possessions been taken or even moved. The officers assured me it \nwas no problem, that they were happy to help, all in that tone that told me \nthey thought I was just a senile old man hearing things in the night. I thanked \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG027 – A Sturdy Lock \n5 \n \nthem as they left, even though they had been of no help whatsoever, and \nspent the rest of the day searching for the key to my bedroom door. I found it \nin the end, and hoped that with it firmly locked I could sleep a bit easier that \nnight. I was wrong. \nWhen evening came, I tried to sleep. At least, I had convinced myself that I was \ntrying to sleep. Actually, I was listening for any sign that the intruder had \nreturned. Every creak of the house settling, every whine of the pipes sent me \ninto a state of near terror. By two o’clock in the morning I had heard nothing, \nand had almost convinced myself that I would not be visited again, when there \nwas that slow, ominous creak of the floorboard at the top of the stairs. As \nbefore, the footsteps approached my bedroom, heavy and methodical. I \nturned on my bedside lamp and watched as once again the handle of the door \nbegan to turn. I could see the pressure being put on the door by whoever was \non the other side, but it was locked, and as the door failed to open, there was a \nlong pause. \nThen it began to turn violently back and forth, rattling and banging as it rotated \nwith such force that I worried it might come off entirely. I let out a cry as the \nassault intensified, and phoned again for the police. It took them twelve \nminutes to reach me, and all the while my bedroom door shook with the \nrelentless turning of the handle, but the lock held firm. As soon as the doorbell \nrang, it went immediately still and silent. I didn’t want to unlock and open the \ndoor, but if I didn’t the police officers might break down my front door or, even \nworse, leave. \nWhat happened next was almost identical to what had happened the day \nbefore, except this time there was less gentle tolerance in their voices when \nthey spoke to me. I got the clear impression that if I called them again without \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG027 – A Sturdy Lock \n6 \n \nproof, there would be... undesirable consequences. One of the two muttered \nsomething about how difficult it must be for me to live on my own, a message I \ngot loud and clear. I have no intention of being put in a home. \nAnd so, for the last month I have lain awake almost every night, as whatever it \nis beyond the threshold of my bedroom tries with all its might to get in. I watch \nthe doorknob obsessively, always waiting for the signs of that gentle turning. \nThe first one’s are always so slow. \nI tried to get proof for the police. I got Marcus to stay over with me a few \nnights, in the hope of either scaring the intruder away or having a witness who \ncould corroborate my story. Those were the only nights I got any peace. \nNothing came up to my door when he was there. In some ways it was a relief, \nto have a way of ensuring I could sleep, but it gave me no evidence to convince \nanyone, and I know he didn’t believe me when I told him what was going on. \nHe just looked… worried when I brought it up, and I didn’t mention it again. \nUnfortunately, I can’t get Marcus to stay with me every night. He has his own \nlife to lead and is living with his fiancée at the moment, so I can’t just ask him \nto move back in with his dad. I tried to set up some cameras in the upstairs \nhallway, at the top of the stairs and outside my room, but they show nothing. \nThey don’t even pick up the door handle turning, even at times I know for \ncertain that the thing was trying to get inside. There was only one moment, \njust a frame or two, I think, where the shadows the camera caught on the wall \nseemed almost to form a face. It seemed to be leering at me, the mouth wide \nopen in a mock scream. It scared me so badly that I had to delete the footage.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 2, "chunk_count": 5, "chars": 4499}}
