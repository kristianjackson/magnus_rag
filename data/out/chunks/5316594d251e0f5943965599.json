I’ve actually been toying with the idea of trying to do something with the \nscale of humanity itself, you know, emphasize all that overpopulation nonsense. \nBut honestly it just doesn’t ring true for me. We’re all just so tiny and pointless, \nyou see, it’s hard to really get past it. Also, I worry it might be straying into \nterritory that emboldens our potential new rival. \nMARTIN \nThe Extinction. \nSIMON \nThe very same. Peter said you’d have a lot of questions about that one. \nMARTIN \nI do. How are new powers born? \nSIMON \nHmm… don’t know. \nMARTIN \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 151 – Big Picture \n7 \n \nHow soon could it attempt this ritual? \nSIMON \n(Cheerily) No clue. \nMARTIN \nHow do we stop it? \nSIMON \nCan’t help you. \nMARTIN \n(Teeth gritted) Could you at least try? \nSIMON \nNo, no, no, you’re right, of course. The thing you have to remember is that no one \nactually knows how these things work, not really. There’s always been plenty of \ntheories of course, and over a century or two you do start to get an intuitive feel \nfor it, but… there’s really no hard and fast rules. \nThe powers, or entities, or fears, or whatever you want to call them, are bound up \nin emotion. In feeling. How they exist, what they can do, how they interact with \nthe world, it all makes about as much logical sense as a nightmare; which is to say \nthere is a certain sort of emotional logic to it all. Things feel like they flow \ntogether in a way that makes sense, but if you try to stop and do the maths then \nit all comes apart, at least in my experience. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 151 – Big Picture \n8 \n \nWhen is a new power born? Well, when does it feel like its birth would be right? \nWhen enough creatures suffer a terror of it that feels distinct, that feels truly its \nown? Then it would probably feel right for it to emerge into its own. Or perhaps \nthere’s a ritual. If it feels right to enact some sort of birthing ceremony, some \napocalyptic - \nMARTIN \n(Interrupting) And how close is it, do you think? \nSIMON \nHard to be sure. Peter thinks very close indeed, what with all the current hubbub, \nI’m inclined to agree. \nMARTIN \nYou don’t sound worried. \nSIMON \nThat’s because we disagree on exactly how bad it will be. Peter seems convinced \nthat the Extinction is different, that its actual birth will be as bad or worse as \nanother power fully manifesting. He believes its advent will be heralded by all \nsorts of disasters and catastrophes and global upheavals, and whatnot. That kind \nof thing. \nMARTIN \nSounds like a rich feeding ground. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 151 – Big Picture \n9 \n \nSIMON \nWell, exactly. Peter, however, seems to think that it will upset the balance that \nwe all have an awful lot invested in, and he’s not at all certain the world as we \nunderstand will come out the other side. \nMARTIN \nAnd let me guess. You think he can’t see the big picture. \nSIMON \nI see why he likes you. It’s all a matter of perspective, you see. My patron has \ngifted me with, quite frankly, an absurdly long life. An appropriate gift and one \nthat serves to provide a certain distance from things. Of course, a paltry few \ncenturies is nothing really, but it’s more than most get. And even in that brief \ntime, I’ve seen all sorts of ebbs and flows to the balance of things. Do you know \nwhen the last ritual I attempted was? \nMARTIN \nI - I don’t know, that space station? \nSIMON \nOh goodness no, that’s the future, my boy! No. It was 1853, the height of the \naquarium mania. All over the empire, people were starting to understand the \ndepths of the terrible unknown below the ocean, and I thought that was a rich \nvein to be tapped.
