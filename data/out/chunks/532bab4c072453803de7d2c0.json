But I have done so much good with my life, I’ve reached \nfurther helped more people than they ever could have. Since this became my \nexistence I’ve thrown myself into philanthropy harder than ever, and the world is \nso much better for me being in it. I’m not saying how I live is right, or good, but it \nis the position I have been put in, and a decision I have to make. I never wanted to \nweigh up the value of a life, to set it on the scales against my own, but that’s a \nchoice that I am forced into. And it is one I will continue to make. \nARCHIVIST \nStatement ends. \n \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 155 – Cost of Living \n13 \n \nWhat is the value of a life? Is it something that can be quantified, put down as \nnumbers, good deeds, bad? And when your life your existence is at the cost of \ndoing harm, what then? I’ve - (laughs) I’ve saved the world, the whole world. \nDoes that give me the right to take what I need to survive? I’ve been reading \nnothing but these old, dry statements for so long, I - I feel weak. Like I’m fading \naway. Do I restrain myself, keep my appetite in check, even at the cost of my life? \nOr do I try to rationalize what I am, like Ms. McHugh? I find myself hating her, her \ncallous self-deception. But am I so different? Daisy’s chosen to resist in her own \nway, knowing full well it might take her life in the end, Melanie too. I respect \nthem for it, but I - I don’t know if I can follow their path. \nI suppose I have a way out now. One that wouldn’t even kill me, at least, I hope \nnot. And yet here I am still. Am I a coward? I just... what if they need me? What if. \n[Melanie knocks on door] \nARCHIVIST \nOh, come in, Melanie. Funny, I was just… how are you? \nMELANIE \nI’m... good, actually. Uh, yeah. Yeah. I am good. \nARCHIVIST \nYou sound like you’ve made a decision. \nMELANIE \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 155 – Cost of Living \n14 \n \nI have, yes. \nARCHIVIST \nRight. \nMELANIE \nThanks for telling me, by the way. It didn’t look like it was easy for you. \nARCHIVIST \nIt wasn’t. I don’t think, uh... I don’t think it wants to lose anyone, but I thought \nyou of all people deserve the option. \nMELANIE \nYes. \nARCHIVIST \nBut I understand it’s a big thing. We’ll keep looking. Maybe there’s another way-- \nMELANIE \n No, John. I’m going to do it. I’m quitting. \nARCHIVIST \nOh. You’re sure you’ve thought it through? I don’t know if we can look after you, \nyou know? Afterwards. \nMELANIE \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 155 – Cost of Living \n15 \n \nYou won’t need to. I’ve - I’ve made a few arrangements, and… (shaky breath) it’s \ngoing to be okay. Honestly. I think it is. I - I can’t be a part of this anymore and if \nthis is the price, then I think I’m okay to pay it. \n(Inhale) It’s - it’s the rest of you I’m worried about. \nARCHIVIST \nWe’ll be fine. Always have been. \nMELANIE \n(Scoffs lightly) Not always. \nARCHIVIST \nNo, I guess not ...well, if you’re sure. \nMELANIE \nI won’t be around after this, but I’ll leave details in case you need to get in touch, \num, but… \nARCHIVIST \nI understand. \nHow are you planning on doing it? \nMELANIE \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 155 – Cost of Living \n16 \n \nGot, uh, got one of those awls from the book repair suppliers, up in the library? \n(Shakily) If it can punch through books it can punch through, uh… Well it - it \nshould do the trick. No reason to try and make it too complicated. \nARCHIVIST \nI - I suppose not. \nMELANIE \nI’ve left a proper resignation letter on Lukas’s desk. It was quite satisfying to \nwrite, actually. Almost made me wish it was Elias. He would have hated me not \nserving out my two weeks notice, heh. Not sure Lukas even knows who I am… \nprobably for the best. \nARCHIVIST \nWe’ll miss you. \nMELANIE \n(Wryly) Wish I could say the same. \nARCHIVIST \n(Quietly) Yeah. Do you need any, uh... help? \nMELANIE \n(Deep breath) No. I’ve got this. But if you, um... If you could… In five minutes, I \nwould appreciate it if you could call me an ambulance.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 4, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 4041}}
