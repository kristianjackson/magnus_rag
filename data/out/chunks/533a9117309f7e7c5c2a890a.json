When I was six, my best friend Piotr fell when we were climbing \ntogether. He survived, but broke his leg so badly that he still walks with a limp \ntoday. From that moment, that long terrible moment when I watched him fall, \nwhenever I would watch the acrobats fly through the air it was all I could do \nnot to close my eyes. Still, that doesn’t change the fact that my visit to the \ncircus in Morshansk remains some of the happiest memories I have of my \nchildhood. \nOne day in early November, the circus came to Algasovo. To say this was \nstrange is to put it very mildly. As I’ve said, we were a small village, and far \nbelow the notice of the troupes that travelled the region. More than that, \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG044 – Tightrope \n3 \n \nwinter was beginning to set in, and it should have been many months before \nthe touring season began again. \nThen, as now, all circuses were owned and run by the government, something \nthat is taken very seriously, so the idea that it might be an independent \ncompany that had simply found itself in Algasovo was unthinkable. There were \nalways rumours of vagrants or travellers who would set up their own shows, \nbut these would be small things, always half-ready to move on if someone \nreported them to the local сельсовет. This circus was huge, easily as big as \nthe ones I would see at Morshansk. The trucks rolled through the village \nshortly before dawn, and by the evening there it stood in the field to the east \nof town. Over the entrance stood a brightly painted wooden sign that read \n“Другой Цирк”, “Another Circus”. \nI begged my father to go. He was weary, but it became clear that almost \neveryone in the village was planning to visit, even if only so they knew what to \nreport to the сельсовет later. Soon a mob of us were heading through the icy \nNovember evening towards the colourful tents and bright lights. As we \napproached I heard a shrill, piping sound. I’d never before heard a steam organ \n– they had not been used in the other circuses I had visited, and I found the \nnoise invigorating. There was something in its shriek that thrilled me, though it \nwas the last time I would be able to hear such a sound without being filled with \nthe deepest dread. \nThere was no fence around the outside, but instead the gate stood alone \nbefore the circus, with the name illuminated by gaslights either side. It was not \na surprise that such a place would not have electricity like the ones in \nMorshansk, but still it seemed as though the flickering shadows cast by those \nlamps were starker than I was used to. Next to the gate stood a short woman \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG044 – Tightrope \n4 \n \nin a leotard, seemingly oblivious to the cold. As the group of us approached, \nshe began to wave with a slow, languid motion and called over for us to come \nin. The circus was open, she said, and all were welcome. Her voice was strange. \nThe Russian she spoke was perfect, but her accent, her intonation were all \nwrong; each time she spoke it was abrupt and repetitive, like a scratched \nrecord. \nIf my father and his friends noticed, they didn’t show any sign of it, though \nthey were suspicious enough already. I didn’t care. I was too excited about the \ncircus. Ivan was even keener than I was, and upon hearing this invitation, he \nburst out of the crowd and ran eagerly through the gate. And then it was as \nthough some spell were broken, and the wariness seemed to disappear all at \nonce. My father took my hand and led me through under that bright sign, \npaying the five roubles for entry. \nBeyond it there were more gaslights casting their pallid glow on tents and \nwagons. That whistling steam organ still played, giving the place a feeling of life \nand energy, while the air was full of sweet smells. From behind the tent came \nthe roar of a big cat, and I let go of my father’s hand as I ran ahead to see. Sure \nenough, there, sat behind thick iron bars, was the vivid, orange face of a tiger. \nIt regarded me with narrowed eyes, though it remained still. I was entranced. \nIts fur was shiny and thick, and its mouth curled open to reveal long teeth of \nbrilliant white. I had seen bears and lions before, and once even an elephant, \nbut I’d never seen a real-life tiger before. I leant closer, until all that was \nbetween us were six inches and some rusty iron bars. \nAs I stared at this beautiful creature in front of me, it moved its head. It was \nthe strangest thing to watch. It seemed to shift its position slowly, like", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 1, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 4499}}
