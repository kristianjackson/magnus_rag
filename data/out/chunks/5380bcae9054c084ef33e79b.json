In an uncharacteristic example of actually dealing with \nmodern technology, my predecessor had the good sense to make a copy of the \nfinal text conversation between Alan Parfitt and Mr Woodward. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG005 – Thrown Away \n11 \n \nI had Martin conduct a follow-up interview with Mr Woodward last week, but \nit was unenlightening. Apparently there have been no further bags at number \n93 and in the intervening years he has largely discounted many of the stranger \naspects of his experience. I wasn’t expecting much, as time generally makes \npeople inclined to forget what they would rather not believe, but at least it got \nMartin out of the Institute for an afternoon, which is always a welcome relief. \nSasha had more luck following up with the old police reports. Alan Parfitt was \nreported as a missing person by his brother Michael on the 20th of August \n2009, and his location remains unknown. The bag of teeth is also corroborated \nby the police reports of Police Constables Suresh and Altman, though they can \nprovide no further details, as they never made an arrest or even located any \nsuspects. The medical report on the teeth themselves does give one puzzling \ndetail: the teeth were confirmed to be human, but more than that, as far as \nthe examiner was able to determine... they were all in different stages of decay \nand didn’t match any available dental records, but all two thousand seven \nhundred and eighty of them were the exact same tooth. \nEnd Recording. \n[The Magnus Archives Theme - Outro] \n \nThe Magnus Archives is a podcast distributed by Rusty Quill and licensed under \na creative commons attribution, non-commercial share alike 4.0 international \nlicense.
