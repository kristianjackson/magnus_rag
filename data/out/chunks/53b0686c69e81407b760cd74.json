Throughout the show \nI kept getting the faintest smell of ozone and was worried. The only other time \nI’d smelled that in the theatre was when one of my stage hands had \naccidentally ordered the wrong sort of light and we’d ended up installing a \nprojector with a xenon-mercury lamp – the sort used to sterilise medical \nequipment with UV. I spotted the issue before anything happened, but I still \nremember that intense ozone smell. Still, no-one else seemed to notice it and I \ncouldn’t see anything in their light set-up that would have caused the odour, \nso I tried my best to ignore it. \nAfter the performance was finished, Katherine and I grabbed a quick dinner \nbefore heading to our respective evening shows. I was disappointed to \ndiscover that whatever attraction there had been between us seemed to have \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG004 – Page Turner \n5 \n \nvanished completely, and while we spent a pleasant enough couple of hours \ntogether it was obvious that neither of us wanted to take it any further. I did \nshow her the book, though. She knew even less Latin than I did, but was \nimpressed. She said it looked valuable and that I should take it somewhere to \nbe appraised, although she didn’t look through it in any detail, as the pictures \ntriggered her vertigo for some reason. \nNothing of note occurred after I left. I did my show, a production of Much Ado \nAbout Nothing down at the Courtyard Theatre, with no problems. I returned \nhome late, having gone for a drink with the stage manager and a couple of the \nactors, and felt far too awake to just go to bed, so I poured myself a small gin \nand tonic and decided to look through this book in more detail. Oddly enough, \nI somehow hadn’t learned any more Latin since I bought it twelve hours \nbefore, so reading it was still out of the question, but I went through and had a \ncloser look at those woodcuts. There were about a dozen that I found, mostly \nmountains and cliffs but one appeared to be a tower, looming over the \nsurrounding countryside at an odd angle, with tiny birds just visible circling the \nsummit. And then there was that picture of an empty sky. I’ve never had any \nfear of heights, but staring at that picture I felt… I don’t know, really. I just \ncouldn’t look at it for too long. It seemed to open forever, nothing to do but \nfall into it. It was even stranger as there wasn’t much to the picture itself \nexcept for black ink and a few stylised stars, but something in the proportions \njust had that effect on me. \nI decided that maybe Katherine had been right, and it might be valuable as an \nantique, so I did some research to try and find out more about it. Latin fell out \nof favour as a language for academic texts in the 18th Century and I really", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 2, "chunk_count": 10, "chars": 2793}}
