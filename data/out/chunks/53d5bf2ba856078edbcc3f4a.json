Down. \nTREVOR \nOr we check if you’re still human enough to bleed. \n(Julia laughs.) \nJULIA \nYou’ve got something of ours. \nTREVOR \nSomeone. \nJULIA \nTook him right from under our noses. \nTREVOR \nIn our own house. \nJULIA \nI call that rude, don’t you? \nARCHIVIST \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 153 – Love Bombing \n13 \n \nGerry wasn’t yours. You had no right -- \nTREVOR \n(Mockingly) You hear that, Julia? “Gerry”! \nJULIA \nSounds like you’ve got pretty chummy. (Threateningly) Where is he? \nARCHIVIST \nGone. \nJULIA \nWhat do you mean, gone? \nTREVOR \nNot gonna ask you again, son. \nARCHIVIST \nI burned the page. Released him. \n(Pause.) \nTREVOR \nAren’t that right noble of you? \nJULIA \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 153 – Love Bombing \n14 \n \nProper humanitarian. \nTREVOR \nSo. Let me get this straight. We take you in, protect you from the thing that’s \nhuntin’ you - \nJULIA \nSpare your life even though you’re no help - \nTREVOR \n- help you, give you access to one of our most valuable resources, and you steal it \nfrom us, piss off back to England, and then burn it? That’s just inconsiderate. \nARCHIVIST \nHe asked me to. \nJULIA \nOh really? You always do what evil books tell you to, do you? \nTREVOR \nGotta say I’m disappointed. Genuinely thought you were different… but you’re \njust another monster. Not even worth the chase. \nJULIA \nYou want the honors, old man? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 153 – Love Bombing \n15 \n \nTREVOR \nDon’t mind if I do. \n(Trevor and Julia laugh.) \nDAISY \nGet away from him. \nTREVOR \nOh, who’s this? You got yourself a watchdog? \nJULIA \nMore of a lapdog. Scrawny, isn’t she? \nDAISY \nI said get back. \nTREVOR \nMalnourished, I’d say. How long since you last tasted blood? \nJULIA \nYou think you can take us both? \nDAISY \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 153 – Love Bombing \n16 \n \nI’d enjoy it. I’ll start with you, old bastard, he’s slower and doesn’t guard his neck. \nAnd you worry about him too much, don’t you? I go for him, you get sloppy. \nPredictable. \nJULIA \nSure. Or I slit your little bookworm’s throat. \nDAISY \nDo it. It’ll give me a chance to finish off your dad. \nTREVOR \nI’m not her father. \nARCHIVIST \n(Winded) Not by blood maybe. \nJULIA \nShut it. \n(A long silence. Trevor takes a deep breath.) \nTREVOR \nCome on, Julia. \nJULIA \nWhat?? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 153 – Love Bombing \n17 \n \nTREVOR \nThere’s no rush. (Chuckling) We’ve got all the time in the world. Besides, this \nplace is just full of monsters. She can’t guard ‘em all. \nJULIA \n(Angered, labored breathing) Fine. \n(Daisy lets out a growl.) \n[The door slams. Several moments of silence.] \nARCHIVIST \n...thank you. I don’t know - Daisy? (Daisy groans) Are you alright? \nDAISY \nDon’t touch me. \nARCHIVIST \nChrist, he was right, I didn’t - didn’t - when did you get so thin? \nDAISY \nI’m not, it’s fine. \nARCHIVIST \nIt’s the Hunt, isn’t it? Without it- \nDAISY \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 153 – Love Bombing \n18 \n \nI’m fine. Just haven’t been hungry. I’m strong enough. \nARCHIVIST \nClearly. \nDAISY \nThey’re not gone yet. We could still get them - \nARCHIVIST \nDaisy, no. It’s like you say. Don’t listen to the blood. \nDAISY \nListen to the quiet. \nARCHIVIST \nEven so, if it’s having this much of an effect - \nDAISY \nI’m not going back. I can’t let it in again. \nARCHIVIST \nBut it… what if it kills you? \nDAISY \nHeh. Always said I was dedicated to justice. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 153 – Love Bombing \n19 \n \nARCHIVIST \n(Concerned) Daisy. It’s not - you can’t think like that. \nDAISY \nJohn. Do you have any idea how much damage you can do if you’re a police \nofficer who wants to hurt people? How much the system will protect you? \nI managed to keep most of it from Basira, but- \nARCHIVIST \nIt wasn’t you. That was the Hunt. \nDAISY \nWe were the same. \nARCHIVIST \nYou’d never known anything different. \nDAISY \nBecause I never wanted to. All that time trapped was good for one thing. \nThinking. And I did a lot of it. I’ve made my choice. \nARCHIVIST \nOkay. So what do we do when they come back?", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 5, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 3969}}
