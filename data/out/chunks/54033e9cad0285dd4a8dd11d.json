You seem like educated sorts, so I’m sure you read in the \npapers how that went. Soon enough, though, the trenches were dug and the \nboredom started to set in. Now, boredom is fine, understand, when the \nalternatives are bombs, snipers and gas attacks, but months at a time sitting in \na waterlogged hole in the ground, hoping your foot doesn’t start swelling, \nwell… it has a quiet terror all its own. \nWilfred came to us in July of 1916. I’m not intimately familiar with his history \nbut he clearly came from stock good enough to be assigned as a probationary \nSecond Lieutenant. I was a Sergeant at the time, so had the job of giving him \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG00X – The Piper \n3 \n \nthe sort of advice and support that a new officer needs from a NCO with two \nyears of mud under his nails. That notwithstanding, I will admit taking a dislike \nto the man when I first met him – he outranked me, and most of the others in \nthe trench, in both military and social terms, and he seemed to treat the whole \naffair with an airy contempt. There’s a sort of numbness that you adopt after \nmonths or years of bombing, a deliberate blankness which I think offended \nhim. He was unfailingly polite, far more so than I was accustomed to in the \nFlanders mud, where the conversations, such as they were, were coarse and \nbleak. Yet under this politeness I could feel him dismiss out of hand any \nsuggestion that I gave him or report that I made. It came as no surprise to me \nto when he mentioned he wrote poetry. To be perfectly honest I expected him \nto be dead within a week. \nTo Wilfred’s credit, he made it almost a year before anything horrendous \nhappened to him, and by the following spring I’d venture to say that we might \nalmost have been able to call each other friends. He had been composing \npoetry during this time, of course, and occasionally would read it out to some \nof the men. They generally enjoyed it, but personally I thought it was dreadful \n– there was an emptiness to it and every time he tried to put the war into \nwords it just sounded trite, like there was no soul to what he had to say. He \nwould often talk about his literary aspirations, and how he longed to be \nremembered, to take what this war truly was and immortalise it. Were I prone \nto flights of fancy, I daresay I would call his words portentous. When he talked \nlike that, he had an odd habit of trailing off in the middle of the conversation \nwith a tilt of his head, as though his attention had been taken by a far-off \nsound. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG00X – The Piper \n4 \n \nThe spring thaw had just recently passed when it happened, and we were on \nthe offensive. Our battalion was near Savy Wood when the orders came down \n– we were to attack the Hindenburg Line. Our target was a trench on the west \nside of St. Quentin. It was a quiet march. Even at this stage there was often still \nsome excitement when the orders came down for action, even if it was usually \nstifled by that choking fear that you got when waiting for the whistle. Yet that \nmorning there was something different in the air, an oppressive dread. We’d \nmade this attack before and knew that the change from the valley exposed us \nto artillery fire. And artillery was always the scariest part of it for me. Bayonets \nyou could dodge, bullets you could duck, even gas you could block out if you \nwere lucky, but artillery? All you could do against artillery was pray. \nEven Wilfred felt it, I could tell. He was usually quite talkative before combat. \nMorbid, but always talkative. That morning he didn’t say a word. I tried to talk \nwith him and raise his spirits, as is a sergeant’s duty, but he just held up his \nhand to quiet me, and turned his head to listen. At the time I didn’t know what \nit was he was hearing but it kept him silent. Even when we crested the ridge, \nand the rest of us tried to drown out the deafening thrum of artillery with our \nown charging cry, even then he made no sound. \nThe ground shook with the impact of the mortar shells, and I ran from foxhole \nto crater to foxhole, keeping my head low to avoid the bullets. As I ran, I felt a \nshooting pain in my ankle and pitched forward into the mud. Looking down, I \nsaw I’d been caught by a length of barbed wire, half-hidden by the damp \nupturned soil. I felt a surge of panic begin to overtake me and frantically tried \nto remove the wire from my leg but only succeeded in getting my hand \nscratched", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 1, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 4499}}
