I need – \nELIAS \nCould I speak to your Chief Inspector, please? Tell her Elias Bouchard is calling. \nOf the Magnus Institute. \nOFFICER \nOh, er… Sure. \nELIAS \nThank you. \nCHIEF \nChief Inspector Kaugery. \nELIAS \nAh, yes, er, good afternoon.

Er, she should be here in about fifteen minutes. \nCHIEF \nI’ll send some officers over immediately \nELIAS \nThat would be wonderful. Much appreciated. \n[The call is hung up.] \nStatement of Barnabas Bennett, as given in a short letter to Jonah Magnus. \nApril 9th, 1824. \nELIAS (STATEMENT) \nMy dear Jonah, \nYou must help me. If anyone is still here, it is you. I know your work brings you \ninto contact with all sorts of fantastical terrors, so perhaps you might have it \nwithin your power to save me from this place. And it was you who warned me \nnot to cross Mordechai Lukas. Advice that I have, I’m afraid, disregarded. \nIt was a small enough thing, as I believed. A trifling debt I fell behind on. And \nwhen he met me in that garden, quiet as it always is with him, he demanded \nrepayment. Well, I took it poorly, and laughed at his insistence. “Bring it before \nthe courts,” I told him. After all, what judge would find in his favour over mine? \nHe simply regarded me silently for many minutes, staring with such a cast to \nhis face that I could feel my resolution beginning to falter. “You shall pay me,” \nhe said at last, “in kind.” Then he walked away. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG092 – Nothing Beside Remains \n4 \n \nLet me tell you, Jonah, I believed myself profoundly lucky that day as my \nhansom deposited me on the steps of my townhouse, a mood only slightly \nshaken by the impression that, as the cab pulled away, it seemed to have no \ndriver that I could discern. \nI am lucky, Jonah, but only insofar as that I never married. Never fathered \nchildren. Never let anyone get closer than my brother. The pangs of loneliness I \nfeel are no more acute than my general longing for the company of my fellow \nman. I have no-one whose absence truly pains me. \nAnd yet here, in this empty world, I cannot but spend these nights, these \ndreadful, silent nights, huddled and frozen in some terrible fear I find myself \nunable to name. I almost think I hear the mocking joy of my friends, but there \nis nobody here, and never shall be again. I try to read, to lose myself in \nsomething that is not the absence of humanity. How is it that the books speak \nto me of my isolation more acutely than the silence? For every treatise I read \non this world and its workings, the more I know I am to spend my time left in it \nwithout comfort or reprieve. With every tale of love or society I feel more \nkeenly the absence of both. \nI went to Egypt once with the Royal Society, to the temple of Ramses the \nSecond in Abu Simbel. The place was remarkable, of course, but what sticks so \nkeenly in my mind is the journey. Two days earlier, on the road from Aswan, I \nfound myself separated from my fellow travellers. I do not know how it \nhappened, but I spent two hours alone there, under the blazing sun, staring \nacross the vast empty expanses of that ancient country. I revelled in the \nsilence, then, embraced the loneliness like an old friend. But now that friend \nhas devoured me, and I shall not emerge from its jaws.
