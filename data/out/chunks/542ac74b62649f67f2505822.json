I knew you were all planning something, of \ncourse, but I didn’t believe you specifically would have the, ah, capacity for \nboldness that you displayed. Took me quite by surprise. \n \nMARTIN \nYou didn’t just see it in me? \n \nELIAS \nHonestly, I didn’t look. For all my power, I will admit I am not immune to \nmaking the occasional lazy assumption. I presumed that I knew you \nthoroughly, but by the time you demonstrated otherwise… Well, there was \nsimply too much to keep watching over. I only have two eyes, after all. \n \nINSPECTOR \nRight. Are you all done now? \n \nELIAS \nI believe so. I think we should be fine, provided you make sure the data \nreaches the Chief Inspector. \n \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG120 – Eye Contact \n \n11 \n \nINSPECTOR \nI’m sure she’ll be happy to pick you out a cell personally. \n \nELIAS \nSo long as it isn’t the morgue, I’m sure I’ll be perfectly comfortable. \n \nMARTIN \nJust be… be careful with him, alright? He can see things, put thoughts and… \nstuff… into your head. \n \nINSPECTOR \nLike I said, I’ve been briefed, and the situation is being monitored. \n \nELIAS \nQuite unnecessary, I assure you. \n \nMARTIN \nJust please be careful. He’s really dangerous. \n \nINSPECTOR \nWell, by all means, Mr Bouchard, why don’t you have a look in my head and \nsee exactly what will happen to you when you mess with me. \n \nELIAS \nThere’ll be no need for that, Inspector. I’m sure we’ll get along famously. \n \nINSPECTOR \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG120 – Eye Contact \n \n12 \n \nGood. \n \nELIAS \nBest of luck, Martin. Let the others know I shall be thinking of them. \n \nINSPECTOR \nCome on now. \n \n(Elias grumbles) \n \nELIAS \nAre those really necessary? \n \n(The inspector punches Elias) \n \nINSPECTOR \nNot really, no. \n \nELIAS \n(Wheezing) I see. \n \nINSPECTOR \nLet’s go. \n \nELIAS \nGoodbye, Martin. Be seeing you. \n \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG120 – Eye Contact \n \n13 \n \n(Door closes) \n \n(Martin sighs) \n \n(Slight static) \n \nPETER \nMust be a relief. \n \nMARTIN \nUuuuhhh... \n \nPETER \nHonestly, I thought there’d be more of a scene, but he always surprises me. \n \nMARTIN \nWhat... What are you doing here. Mr Lukas? \n \nPETER \nPlease, call me Peter. \n \nMARTIN \nUm, no. No, I think I’m okay. \n \nPETER \nAs you like. Look, don’t let Elias get to you. You did very well. Really. I honestly \nthink you managed to surprise him, even if he’d sooner die than admit it. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG120 – Eye Contact \n \n14 \n \n \nMARTIN \nI’m sorry, I’m still not sure exactly what this is. \n \nPETER \nOh, right, of course. Well, you’ve successfully managed to remove Elias as the \nHead of the Magnus Institute, so... \n \nMARTIN \nOh. Oh God. What does that do? \n \nPETER \nHm? Oh, no. No, no, no, not in any, um, metaphysical sense. No, he’s still very \nmuch the, um … how did he insist on phrasing it? Ah yes, the “beating heart” of \nthe Institute. But practically speaking, he can hardly fulfil his more mundane \nmanagerial duties from a jail cell. \n \nMARTIN \nSo he knew this was going to happen? \n \nPETER \nNot exactly. He... anticipated that you would likely find some way to remove \nhim. So he made alternative arrangements. \n \nMARTIN \nWhich would be you. \n \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG120 – Eye Contact \n \n15 \n \nPETER \n(Cheerful) Exactly! To be honest with you, Martin, I didn’t expect to be taking \nover the place so soon, or in quite such a state of disarray, but I’ll do my best \nto keep the place afloat. \n \nMARTIN \nRight. \n \nPETER \nOh, what’s that look for? You won! I am sorry if it doesn’t look quite like you \nhoped, but here we are. \n \nMARTIN \nI suppose so. So what now? \n \nPETER \nWell, if you could send Melanie and Basira up to see me, I’d like to introduce \nmyself. After that, I’ll put through a couple of weeks of paid leave for you all. I \nthink giving everyone some space to try and deal with the loss of Tim and Daisy \nmight do everyone some good. Oh, and if you want to talk to a counsellor, the \nInstitute will of course cover any costs. \n \nMARTIN \nUm... Thanks? \n \nPETER", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 4, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 3989}}
