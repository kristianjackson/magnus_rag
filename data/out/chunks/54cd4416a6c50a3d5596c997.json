I think that was the name, anyway, something \nlike that. He was normally slurring quite badly when he said it. He thought it \ntranslated to “The Spiders that Devour”, but a Japanese friend once told me it \nwas closer to just “spiders are eating”. \n \nAccording to Dexter, Kumo was an old Tokusatsu movie which he believed had \ncome out some time in the mid-to-late sixties. It was about a spider, just the \none, despite the title, that grew to a colossal size and terrorised a small \nunnamed island off the coast of Kagoshima. What struck him about it, though, \nwas the utter absence of anything resembling a hero or protagonist. No-one \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG110 – Creature Feature \n \n5 \n \nfought against the monster, and although there were vignettes in the lives of \nthose under the spider’s shadow, they all ended the exact same way: with the \ncharacter in question marching slowly and calmly into its waiting jaws. \nWhenever Dexter described this, his eyes would widen and he’d start trying to \nrecreate the sound that they made as they were eaten. He always claimed he \nwasn’t doing it right, but the noises he ended up making were unsettling \nenough. \n \nAs far as either of us could determine, the film never existed. At least, not in \nany form that left a traceable record. Dexter had followed it up in a lot more \ndetail than I had ever bothered to, and had checked with collectors of obscure \nfilm paraphernalia and long-defunct Japanese production studios. He actually \nshowed a pretty surprising aptitude for the language, but it was just dead end \nafter dead end. I ended up watching half a dozen different giant spider movies \nwith him over our time together, and none of them were right. He’d just \nwatch, muttering under his breath, “No, no, no,” and chewing on the back of \nhis thumb. \n \nIt wasn’t something I ever really minded. Out of all the many and varied quirks \nof Dexter Banks, his minor obsession with a Japanese spider movie that may or \nmay not have ever existed was one of the least unpleasant. At least until I got \nthe call about his final project. He told me over the phone that he was \nproducing a new film, that it was going to be his masterpiece. Then he started \nto describe it, and I don’t know how much of what I felt was déjà vu and how \nmuch was just dread. I asked if he had found a copy of the film, or a script, but \nhe just laughed. “Better,” he said. “I found the book it was based on.” \n \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG110 – Creature Feature \n \n6 \n \nThen he hung up, and I was left sitting there, feeling this gnawing \napprehension that I just couldn’t place. I realised what had disturbed me later. \nIt was such a small thing, but it really nagged at me. It was the idea that Dexter \nwould ever describe a book as better than a film. That sounds like I’m insulting \nhim, but you’d need to know him to understand: film was everything to him. \nOther media might as well not have existed. \n \nRegardless, he went into production. He called it Widow’s Weave and, while \nthe script pages he brought were apparently based on this unnamed book of \nhis, the shots were drawn from his memories of the first film version, assuming \nit existed anywhere outside his head, of course. Part of me secretly assumed \nDexter had simply dreamed the movie up and this book was... I don’t know. It \ndidn’t matter, not really. There wasn’t any question about whether or not I \nwas working on it. It was a Dexter Banks film, and my name was basically on \nthe credits already. \n \nThe crew were mostly regulars he’d worked with before, but weirdly for him, \nhe seemed to take almost no interest in casting at all. He asked Debbie Conner, \nour Casting Director, to get him as many no-name, untested hopefuls as the \nscript needed. Bear in mind that at this point any A-lister would have killed to \nbe in Dexter Banks picture, but he didn’t care. For all he kept telling me about \nhow this was his dream project, that he was electrified to finally be making, he \nseemed almost entirely checked out of the process of actually making it. \n \nThere was one exception to this: he claimed to be working with Neil Lagorio to \nmake the spider. Now you might never have heard his name before, but I \nguarantee you you’ll have seen his work. From the mid-seventies right into", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 2, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 4347}}
