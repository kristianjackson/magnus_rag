Your office just too full of \njoy? \nELIAS \nNot quite. I heard you’d had some absences. Some unauthorised leave. I just \nwanted to talk it through with you. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG090 – Body Builder \n2 \n \nTIM \nRight. \nELIAS \nWere you sick? If you’re sick you really need to call in. \nTIM \nNope. Wasn’t sick. Try again. \nELIAS \nWell, you hadn’t booked any leave. \nTIM \nNo, I had not. \nELIAS \nSo, what happened? \nTIM \nI hopped a flight to Malaysia. Found myself a hotel. \nELIAS \nI see. You were trying to leave us? \nTIM \nYeah. \nELIAS \nBut you’ve returned? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG090 – Body Builder \n3 \n \nTIM \nI… I got sick. The longer I was gone… I felt weak, like, like I was losing myself. \nYou gonna fire me boss? \nELIAS \nNo. I don’t think that’ll be necessary. \nTIM \nOf course not. \nELIAS \nBut let’s be sure it doesn’t happen again, hm? \nTIM \nYou do know, right? I mean, you must know. \nELIAS \nKnow what? \nTIM \nAbout this place. About what it does to us. \nELIAS \n(Sigh) Tim, this place is very old. It has all sorts of… idiosyncrasies and not all of \nthem are good for the people who work here. \nTIM \nI think I’d prefer asbestos. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG090 – Body Builder \n4 \n \nELIAS \nI’ve always found the best way to deal with it is to lose yourself in work. \nPersonally, the comfortable rigour of bureaucracy has always helped me. \nPerhaps doing a bit of mindless filing will help distract you. \nTIM \nYeah. I mean… maybe you’re right. \nELIAS \nI’m sure I am. And no more unauthorised absence, okay? \n[The door opens. Martin enters.] \nMARTIN \nOh, er, is everything okay in here? \nELIAS \nYes, Martin, very much so. \n[Elias leaves] \nMARTIN \nRight. Um, I was actually gonna to record a statement, if, if that’s alright Tim? \nTIM \nYeah. It’s already running. \nMARTIN \nOh. Oh, so it is. Why, why did you tur- \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG090 – Body Builder \n5 \n \n[Tim leaves, closing the door] \nRight. Right. \nMartin Blackwood, Archival Assistant at the Magnus Institute, recording \nstatement number 0130807, statement of Ross Davenport, given August 7th \n2013. \nStatement begins. \nMARTIN (STATEMENT) \nSo I had to find a new gym. It was a shame, really. I loved my old place, and the \nguys there were some of my best mates, but… it wasn’t entirely my own \ndecision. See, I recently decided to start taking anabolic steroids to supplement \nmy bodybuilding, and the place I used to go had a very strict policy about \nthem. Matt, the guy who ran the place, his partner had gotten deep into them, \nand when he had a heart attack, Matt blamed the steroids. Since then, you get \nseen with a needle or pill bottle that’s not a recognised supplement, and \nyou’re outta there. \nStill, I didn’t leave because I got caught or anything like that. I hadn’t even \nstarted when I left. I just felt guilty. Like it was an admission of failure. Eleven \nyears I’d been going, all natural, and, physically, I was at the top of my game. I \ndid well in competitions, I felt healthy, I was pretty much the ideal weight for \nmy height, but when I looked in the mirror I still didn’t see what I wanted to. \nMy muscles were smooth and rounded, not like the, the veined, bulging forms \nI idolised. Even when I spent weeks dieting before a competition, without an \nounce of body fat, I, I just couldn’t get there. I’d reached my natural peak, and \nit wasn’t enough for me.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 0, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 3865}}
