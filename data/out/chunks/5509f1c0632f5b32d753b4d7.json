Why does a man seek to destroy the \nworld? \nIt’s a simple enough answer: for immortality and power. Uninspired, perhaps, \nbut, my god. The discovery, not simply of the dark and horrible reality of the \nworld in which you live, but that you would quite willingly doom that world \nand confine the billions in it to an eternity of terror and suffering, all to ensure \nyour own happiness, to place yourself beyond pain and death and fear. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 160 – The Eye Opens \n \n11 \nIt is an awful thing to know about yourself, but the freedom, John, the freedom \nof it all. I have dedicated my life to handing the world to these Dread Powers \nall for my own gain, and I feel.. nothing but satisfaction in that choice. \nI am to be a king of a ruined world, and I shall never die. I believe there are far \nmore people in this world who would take that bargain than you would ever \nguess. And I have beaten all of them. \nOf course, this desire did not manifest overnight. When Smirke first gathered \nour little band — Lukas, Scott, and the rest — to discuss and hypothesize on \nthe nature of the things he had learned from Rayner, I felt what I believe we all \nfelt: curiosity and fear. But as he compiled his taxonomy and codified his \ntheories on the grand rituals, I began to develop a very specific concern. \nSmirke was still so obsessed with his ideas on balance, even as our fellows \nbegan to experiment and fall to the service of their patrons. I began to worry \nthat if one of them successfully attempted their ritual, then I would be as much \na victim as any, trapped in the nightmare landscape of a twisted world. \nAt first, I attempted prevention, but the cause seemed hopeless. The only way \nto ensure I did not suffer the tribulations of what I believed to be an inevitable \ntransformation was to bring it about myself. So what began as an experiment \nsoon became a race. Beyond that, I was getting older, and mortality began to \nweigh more heavily on my mind. How much in this world is done because we \nfear death, the last and greatest terror? \nI convinced Smirke to work on Millbank, leading him to design it as a temple to \nall the Fears in equilibrium, such that my own modifications to the design of \nthe Panopticon went… unremarked. It. Took. Years, for the dread of the \nprisoners that passed through to fully suffuse the place, and I was an old man \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 160 – The Eye Opens \n \n12 \nby the time I made my first attempt at the Watcher’s Crown, sat in the centre \nof that colossal eye, the great ring of cells encircling me like a coronet. It was... \nflawed, of course, as all Smirke’s rituals were, and none of the inmates \nsurvived as the power I attempted to harness shook the building almost to \npieces, and the murky swamp upon which the prison was built consumed it. \nBut it left me a gift: For sat in that watchtower, I could see everything I turned \nmy mind to. It was a dizzying power, and one I discovered I maintained even as \nI found vessels to extend my life. Of course, I had to make sure the location \nwas kept under my control while I worked on revising my plans, and so I \nmoved the organization I had founded to assist in my research down to \nLondon, and the Institute as you know it, was born. \nI’ll not bore you with details of my bodies and failures through those \nintervening years. Suffice to say I kept busy, both planning my own next \nattempt, and doing my best to stymie those others who tried versions of their \nown. Surely my interpretation of the Watcher’s Crown had been incomplete; \nthere had been some element of the ritual I had overlooked. It was not until I \nmet Gertrude Robinson that things began to really come into focus. \nYou see, the role of Archivist has been part of the Beholding for as far back as \nmy research can go. This isn’t uncommon for the Powers; most of the beliefs \naround them are guesswork and fallible human interpretation, but there are \ncertain through lines and consistencies that can be spotted, regardless of the \ntrappings. But Gertrude was unlike any other Archivist. She simply did not care \nabout collecting experiences or compiling the fears of others. She was driven \nto stop those who served the Powers.
