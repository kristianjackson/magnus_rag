I began to tail him. \nHector was exactly the kind of guy I always end up following – heading into \nmiddle age, with nothing to show for it but half a head of hair and a beer belly \nstraining against work shirts that always have some kind of food or sweat stain \nproudly on display. A loser. I know I’m not one to talk, but I couldn’t help \nsympathising with the wife. And not just because she was the one paying me. \nHector worked IT for some shipping and delivery company with its admin \ncentre down in Liverpool Street. I say he worked there, but that could easily be \na lie. Even though I wasn’t able to get past the front desk, the sheer number of \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG049 – The Butcher’s Window \n3 \n \nsmoke breaks Hector took out front cast some serious doubts on whether he \nwas doing his job at all. According to wife Nicola, Hector had recently had a \nsudden series of ‘working late’ nights and, based on what I was seeing of him \nat the day job, she was right on the money with her suspicions. There was no \nway this guy was staying a minute past closing. \nSure enough, hanging around his office, I saw him shuffling out the building \nshortly after six. I started shadowing him carefully, although after a few \nminutes it became clear that I really didn’t need to be cautious as all that. The \nman was completely oblivious to anything that wasn’t inside his own head or in \nfront of his face, and after a while I found I could walk literally 15 feet behind \nhim the whole way and he had no idea. I knew I was in luck when I saw him \nhead into the Underground. His route home should have been taken him down \nthe Central line, but instead he headed onto the Hammersmith and City, riding \neast. Whatever, or whoever, his illicit liaisons involved, I was pretty sure that \nme and my camera were following him right to it. \nHe got off the train at Barking, which was promising. It was exactly the sort of \nplace I would have expected the lover of someone like Hector to live: \nresidential, depressing and cheap, for London at least. It was almost 7 o’clock \nby this point and it was late June, so there was still a while before nightfall and \nI got more careful about my pursuit. There were less people here, so blending \ninto a crowd was no longer an option and I made sure to keep a bit more \ndistance as he walked down streets of terraced houses. \nWe had been walking for about twenty minutes when I began to realise that he \nwasn’t going into any of the houses. Instead, he made his way south until he \nreached the A13.
