The hunger for more, the \nunformed, unfocused, but impossibly huge desire to exist. To join the minds \nthat gave them shape and purpose, and finally drink their fill ‘til they were one \nand the same. They had no concept of how, or when, or even why, but they \nneeded it. They needed it. \n[The ethereal singing comes to the fore] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nAnd so the things that were fear began to sing, to draw ever more multitudes \nto them, to shape them and push them and beg them for freedom. For \nexistence. But though they jostled and pushed and fought to emerge, they \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 200 – Last Words \n14 \ncould not. For they could not conceive of what or where they were beyond the \nwords and images the minds below could give them. \n[The creature sounds fade away; the singing continues] \n[The clacking sounds of looms and gears fades in, as well as the \ndark electric sound of the void at Hill Top Road] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nBut there was one, the part that some would call the Spider, that had been \ngiven a gift beyond all its brethren. The minds that feared grew suspicious of \ntheir own schemes, of connections and consequences, and over time these \nsuspicions became threads, then webs, then nerves that granted the Spider, \nthe Mother-of-Puppets, the Hidden Machination, a mind of its own; to plot and \nplan and draw its own connections, its own conclusions.

It has only found its end. \n[The doors slide open] \nMARTIN \nJohn? \n[Footsteps as Martin runs in] \nJohn! \nARCHIVIST \nMartin, what are you doing here? \nMARTIN \nOh thank god. Just, just, just stop what you’re about to do, okay? I know that \nyou think that a— \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 200 – Last Words \n16 \n(Beat) \n[Doors close behind Martin] \nWhat’s that? \nARCHIVIST \nElias... Jonah Magnus. \nMARTIN \n(Shocked) He’s— You didn’t—? \nARCHIVIST \nI’m sorry Martin. \nMARTIN \n(Horrified, scared) You didn’t. N-No. No, no, no, no, no, no. No! This isn’t— \nYou can’t— \nARCHIVIST \n(Calm) I did. I am. \nMARTIN \nWhy?! \nARCHIVIST \nYou know why. I can’t let them out. \n(Martin sobs) \nI can’t! Not again. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 200 – Last Words \n17 \nMARTIN \nOh, what have you done, John! \nARCHIVIST \nGo tell the others. It’s over. \nMARTIN \nN-No… you don’t understand! \nARCHIVIST \nWhat? \nMARTIN \nI’m sorry, John. I’m, I’m so sorry... I, I saw you had gone and… and I knew that \nyou-you couldn’t help yourself. You never could! I knew you’d lied to me, that \nyou were going in alone... \nARCHIVIST \nMartin? What did you do? \nMARTIN \n(Shaking) I told them to go early. To do it straight away and... I’d keep you \ntalking. Until they were done. \nARCHIVIST \n(Calm) Oh Martin.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 4, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 4023}}
