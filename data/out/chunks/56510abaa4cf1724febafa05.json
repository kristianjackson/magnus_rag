Another of the firefighters, this one with a fresh black eye, \ncomes over to brief us. Apparently the guy had burst out of the house shortly \nafter they arrived, not a single burn mark on him. The fire brigade had \napproached to see what help he needed, but instead he just started throwing \npunches and trying to run. \nThat was an assault charge, sure, but why the arson? The fireman just sort of \nnods to him, and I realise for the first time the bald guy’s saying something. \nNot loud, but intensely. I mean, this was \nyears ago, so I don’t remember exactly what he was saying, but it definitely \ninvolved the words “cleansing fire”, “all shall be ash” and the name Asag, \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG043 – Section 31 \n6 \n \nwhich I later learned is some kind of Sumarian demon. So that’s fun. I reckoned \nsuspicion of arson was probably about right, and Spencer agreed. \nSo he went to arrest the guy, maybe calm him down some, while I got the \nhandcuffs on. There's still part of me that feels guilty it was that way around. \nAs I was cuffing him, there was this sudden intense pain in my hand. It was just \nas I touched the metal to close them; it was incredibly hot. I once took a \nwelding class, ages back, just kind of on a whim, and made the mistake of \nforgetting that just because metal isn't glowing red doesn't mean it isn't \nscorching hot. \nIt was that same burn, too intense for your mind to process for a second, then \nall your nerves fire at once. It hurt, is what I’m saying. \nIf I hadn't managed to get the cuffs closed before the pain really hit, I don't \nknow what would have happened. As it was I ended up with some badly \nblistered fingers, while in front of me the guy leaned over to Spencer and \nwhispered something right in his ear. I didn't hear what he said, \nbut Spencer went completely pale. He was shaking slightly as we shoved the \nguy in the back of the car, and I had to drive us back to the station. He… \nrefused to tell me what the guy had said. \nOur arsonist's name was Diego Molina. He was assistant curator at some \nMexican museum, come over with a loan to the Natural History Museum, but \nthey hadn't heard from him for a few weeks. He didn't say much in \nquestioning, though his English was clearly fine. Unfortunately, the arson case \ncollapsed pretty quickly, so… we just had to slap him with assault and let him \nwalk with a hefty fine. Spencer didn't exactly help matters by getting himself \nsuspended. The only thing Diego Molina had on him when we brought him in, \nwas a small book bound in red leather. They caught Spencer in Storage, trying \nto destroy it with a Zippo lighter. I never saw him again. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG043 – Section 31 \n7 \n \nThey told me he killed himself when he got home. Apparently he'd somehow \nfilled the bath full of boiling water and just... just got in. Official story was he'd \nsomehow done it using a kettle, which… that, that’s just about the weakest \ncover-up I've ever heard. \n[HEAVY SIGH] Anyway, after that happened, and I'd explained my burned \nfingers, they gave me my very first Section 31. \n \nARCHIVIST \nI see… I-I see. How many, uh, potentially paranormal events do you generally \ninvestigate – a-as a police officer? \nBASIRA \nNone. No-one says the P-word. Not ‘paranormal’, not ‘supernatural’, not even \n‘spooky’. The words you learn to look out for are “weird”, “odd”, “strange” and \nif you hear the phrase “I'm not quite sure what I'm looking at”, then yeah, \nyou're not getting much back-up. \n \nAlmost all of them are false alarms. We get called to a lot of bad drug trips, \nanimal attacks and folks with genuine mental health issues. Those are the ones \nthat have the potential to sound weirdest during initial contact. I didn't get \nanother genuine Section 31 case for… almost three years. \n \nJuly 18th 2014. I remember because it was the hottest day of the year, and the \nair con in the car was out, so we were really suffering. It was me and Alice \nTonner, who… everyone calls her “Daisy”, but I can never get her to tell me \nwhy. Anyway, Daisy was sectioned years before I was even on the force. She's \nnever been that forthcoming about any of her own experience; takes", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 2, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 4195}}
