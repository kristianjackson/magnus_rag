Nobody should ever have to do that. Sergeant once told me \nit’s no different from killing a chicken back home, but people aren’t chickens, \nand the idea that war strips us all down to just a body that moves and kills, or \nfalls and dies, makes me feel sick to my stomach. And I don’t like killing \nchickens either. \nBut none of my feelings mattered in the end. I got the uniform, the training \nand the gun, then ended up shipped off to the Pacific to fight the Japanese. \nI’ve got no desire to share the details of my service. They’re not memories I \ncare to dwell on, and they’re certainly not why I’m here. Let’s just say that \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 137 – Nemesis \n \n3 \n \nneither my noble comrades-in-arms nor the soldiers fighting for His Majesty \nthe Emperor seemed to share my lofty ideals about the sanctity of life. Still, I \ngot through a while without dying and even without killing anybody. That I \nknow of, at least. I fired my gun plenty, I guess. And you don’t usually see \nwhere the bullet lands, do you? \nI was captured after about six months, and sent to the North Point prison camp \nin occupied Hong Kong. At the time it seemed like a relief, but then I hadn’t \nheard the stories about how the Japanese treated their POWs. I mean, these \ndays, after the Tokyo trial and everything, I guess everyone knows how bad it \nwas, but I didn’t have a clue when we first surrendered. The things people will \ndo to their fellow man just because someone with a shinier badge tells them \nto. And even then, our treatment was a picnic compared to the Chinese \nprisoners who came through North Point. But again, that’s not the point and I \nhave no interest in dwelling on the suffering. Plenty of others to tell those \nstories if you want them. \nI was in that place for four months. Four months of hell. And I know others \nwho were in there a lot longer, and I sure don’t envy them, though the way I \ngot out wasn’t exactly ideal. Leonard was the one who heard it first, and he \nwas the closest thing I had to a friend in that place. Leonard Holden, built like a \nbarn and about as complicated. He’d worked on a farm before signing up, and \nsometimes it seemed like that was about the limit of what he thought the \nworld was. At least until the rest of the world caught up with him. Poor \nbastard. We’d been captured at the same time, and the fact his head stuck out \nabove the others meant it was easier for me to stick by him when we were all \ngetting sorted. We pushed through those four months together, me watching \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 137 – Nemesis \n \n4 \n \nhim go from a hulking farm boy into a scrawny beanpole of a man. He never \nlost his smile, though. Not until he heard that music. \nIt was a cool winter night when it happened. It never got properly cold in North \nPoint, not like back home. But you still ended shivering most of your nights \naway. There was the lightest of rains that night, when the Nemesis arrived. We \nwere trying to sleep, pushed into our cramped wooden huts, thin blankets \npulled tight. At first it was a drum beat. Distant, regular, sometimes broken by \nthe rattling roll of a snare drum. I could feel my pulse quicken, like it wanted to \nmatch the tempo, though I’ve no idea why. \nI should have been confused, scared maybe, and I guess I was, but I could also \nfeel my fingers tap-tap-tapping away to the beat. Beside me, Leonard started \nto hum to himself, a tune I could almost half-remember hearing, just before \nthe trumpet began to drift over the waters just a few yards beyond the walls. I \ncall it a ‘trumpet’ because that’s the closest thing I can think to liken to that \nsound, but it sure wasn’t any trumpet they played on the parade ground. \nBy this point we were all out of our beds and clustering around the dirt-caked \nwindows, looking out towards the water. I don’t know if any of us had any \nexpectations of what was going to happen, but unless it was some Japanese \nmilitary thing, I think we were all expecting to watch some people die. And we \ndid, I guess, just the way we thought. \nThere was a boat floating out there, not twenty yards from the shoreline. It \nwasn’t like any Imperial ship I’d ever seen, but I didn’t think it belonged to our \nside either. It was metal, but not like the warships I was used to. It was like an \nold tall ship, with tattered masts and rigging, but made entirely out of cold, \nblack iron. I knew it was cold.
