Jude had only just joined at the \ntime, and was besotted with Agnes, though I couldn’t tell you if she loved her \nas a god or as a woman or as both. \nWhatever the situation, whatever you did, we were left paralysed. Unable to \ngo any further with our destiny and, I was assured, unable to remove the \nimpediment. \nSo we waited. Agnes had reached adulthood, but would age no further, so \nthere was no worry to that. Her fire would someday die, of course, but until \nthen it would neither fade nor dim. We did what we could: we found her a \nplace to live, gave her Jude for a guardian and provided for her material needs. \nAnd the years began to slowly burn away. \n \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 139 – Chosen \n7 \n \nMy job was to provide for her less mundane requirements. I was to secure her \nsacrifices. I would spare you the details, but I do not wish to. I worked in a \nfactory, you see. Large, furnaces that glow red hot at all hours of the day and \nnight. Eventually, enough of my superiors had suffered accidents or injuries \nthat I had obtained a management position. It was difficult to take the space I \nneeded and make the necessary adjustments, especially without anyone \nnoticing, but eventually I was able to create a small workshop just beneath the \nmain furnace. It was far too hot for anyone to check, so I had my peace. I took \nforeign workers, mostly, those with the fewest immediate connections to \ncomplicate matters and the most hopeful dreams of what their life might be. \nThey were the ones that provided Agnes the most satisfying nourishment. \nI would wait for them to be alone and then I would catch them unawares. \nMelting their mouth shut was a simple matter, and the screams they were able \nto make with their throat alone were easily drowned out by the constantly \nroaring machinery. I would drag them down to my workshop, and slowly, bit by \nbit, I would melt them, draining the now-liquid fat from their bodies, that I \ncould later render into tallow. Their heart, their eyes and their tongue I would \nscorch down to ash and mix into it for texture, while the rest I simply \nincinerated. \nOnce fully rendered, I would turn these poor souls into foul-smelling candles, \nthe wicks, twisted from whatever hair and tendon survived, didn’t ignite with \nany flame, instead burning with an black ember that, if you listened very \nclosely, you could almost hear screaming. Agnes would take them to her small, \nempty flat, lay them on the floor and light them. Over the many hours these \ncandles burned she would crane over them, so Arthur tells me, inhaling all the \nagony, suffering and loss from which they were created. Or he could have been \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 139 – Chosen \n8 \n \nlying to me, just keeping me busy with torture and murder so I didn’t get in the \nway of anything. I don’t think I would have minded that, actually. At least I felt \nuseful. \nAside from that, Agnes simply waited. We all did, but I think it was the hardest \non her. So much fire and destruction, trapped raging inside her, as she simply \nsat, placid, waiting for... something. Of course, none of us suspected what was \nactually going to sink it all. I mean, if you’d told me, I’d have laughed at you. \nThat stupid coffee shop twit. \nI honestly don’t know why Arthur allowed it, or why Jude didn’t step in. She’s \nusually so jealous. But Agnes… Maybe Agnes asked them to leave him alone, or \nmaybe they were just surprised by her interest in this boring, unremarkable \nfool. Maybe they assumed it was some long, torturous plan, and she was \nsimply building the kindling for a bonfire of aching loss and suffering such as \nwe had never before seen. And I suppose, in a way, she was. Just not the one \nany of us expected. \nIt wasn’t love, I’m sure of that. I don’t think it was even happiness. But I think it \nwas doubt. In that tiny, sliver of affection, lay a whole universe of doubt. The \nsort of doubt that the torturing Flame Incarnate cannot have, but that too \nmany years spent in silent patience, followed by one clumsy flirt in a coffee \nshop could create. A tiny, hairline fracture which destroys everything. \nWhen she told us... I have known anguish and destruction like few in this \nworld, but the memory of that night still makes me shudder. The sadness and \ngrief we felt at what we knew we had lost. It was Agnes herself that suggested \nit. If we tried the ritual and failed, she said, it might be hundreds of years \nbefore we had the strength to try", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 3, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 4500}}
