And ‘plotting my demise’? \n \nMELANIE \nWhen I get a chance, yes. \n \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG106 ‘A Matter of Perspective’ \n \n18 \n \nELIAS \nHm. \n \nMELANIE \nI suppose that doesn’t look very good on my review? \n \nELIAS \nQuite frankly, no. \n \nMELANIE \nWell, if you need to fire me, I won’t make a scene. \n \nELIAS \nNo, no, I’m afraid not. \n \nMELANIE \nSure. \n \nELIAS \n(Sighing) I wish I knew the words that would make you believe me. \n \nMELANIE \nWhat? That you’re a literal dead man’s switch. \n \nELIAS \nNo. If that was the only issue, I could have simply placed the knowledge in your \nmind. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG106 ‘A Matter of Perspective’ \n \n19 \n \n \nMELANIE \nWhat? \n \nELIAS \nYou already have doubts, though. You’ve been talking with Tim, and have \nconvinced yourself that, even if I’m telling the truth, I’m too dangerous to live. \nWhatever I’m planning needs to be stopped, even if it costs a few lives, \nincluding your own. \n \nMELANIE \nWell, that’s not even— \n \nELIAS \nA rationalisation, of course. A lie about your own selfishness, that you would \nrather be dead than trapped without that self-determination you prize so \nhighly. I wish I knew the words to convince you it’s for the best. \n \nMELANIE \nAre we done? \n \nELIAS \nIt’s too deep. I can see almost anything I care to, read knowledge from \nsomeone’s mind or place it there, but I just cannot change the nature of a \nperson. And I am struggling to think of what could rid you of this misguided \nrage. \n \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG106 ‘A Matter of Perspective’ \n \n20 \n \nMELANIE \nSo let me go. Or kill me. \n \nELIAS \n[Sighing] You know, that is the second such ultimatum I have heard in as many \nweeks. But no, there are always other options. And I am not above threats. \n \nMELANIE \nThreaten, then. I’ve got nothing. \n \nELIAS \nThat’s almost true. Your life is indeed shockingly absent of any meaningful \nconnections. That’s actually one of the reasons I chose you for this job. Your \nfather was your last real anchor, wasn’t he? \n \nMELANIE \nThat’s none of your business. \n \nELIAS \nPerhaps. Five years is plenty of time to grieve. It’s a real tragedy, isn’t it? \nDementia? Especially so early. But he always remembered you, didn’t he, \n“Little Moth”? \n \nMELANIE \nShut. Up. \n \nELIAS \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG106 ‘A Matter of Perspective’ \n \n21 \n \nAt least you got him into a decent care home. Hard to afford on an irregular \nincome like yours, but your mother’s life insurance helped plenty, and Ivy \nMeadows wasn’t as expensive as some of them. It’s a shame about the fire, \nbut I’d have thought it would offer something of a relief. \n \nMELANIE \nW-what are you talking about? \n \nELIAS \nOh, of course. They told you he died in his sleep, didn’t they. Smoke inhalation. \nA real tragedy, but at least he didn’t suffer. \n \nMELANIE \nI— \n \nELIAS \n(Heavy static) Do you want to know what really killed him? \n \n(Melanie gasps & shakes) \n \nAwful, isn’t it? He really suffered. Not really your fault, just bad luck, but that \ndoesn’t comfort you, does it? \n \nMELANIE \n(Distraught) T-take it back! T-take it back! \n \nELIAS \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG106 ‘A Matter of Perspective’ \n \n22 \n \nI’m afraid that’s not really something I can do. I can promise not to make it \nworse, though. \n \nMELANIE \nWha—? No. \n \nELIAS \nYou know how your father really died, and I am sure that is unimaginably \npainful for you. But be aware: if I choose to, I can make you see it. \n \nMELANIE \nNo! \n \nELIAS \nIf you try to interfere with me again, in any way, I will drive that image so deep \ninto your psyche, that even if you are right, even if you live, it will be there \nevery time you close your eyes. \n \nMELANIE \n(Moaning) I, I... \n \nELIAS \nThat’s alright; take your time. Tell you what, why don’t you take the rest of the \nday off. I’m sure you have a lot to process. \n \n(Sobbing)", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 6, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 3926}}
