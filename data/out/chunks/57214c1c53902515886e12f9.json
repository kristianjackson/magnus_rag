I recalled the vampire had been carrying a handbag when \nwe first met it, and had used a key from it to lock the front door. It did not \nhave the handbag with it now, though, so I began to desperately search the \nother rooms of the house, trying to find it. I did find it in the end, in what I \nassume to be the vampire’s bedroom. I’ll not describe it in detail, except to say \nthat it appears to be where the creature took most of its meals. Hopefully that \nmakes the picture clear enough for you. I found the key, though, and escaped \nthat house before the fire did me any serious damage. I was terrified of the \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG010 – Vampire Killer \n9 \n \npolice coming and thinking I was a murderer, so I didn’t stick around. I just fled \ninto the night. \nIt was almost a decade before I encountered another vampire. I’d been living \non the streets all that time, occasionally in and out of various institutions, and \nhad just about managed to convince myself that Sylvia McDonald had just \nbeen a bad reaction to the stress of watching my brother’s murder. It was in \nthe late 60s that I learned different. It was 1968, I remember because that was \nthe year United won the European Cup, and I did quite well out of it – people \nbeing generous to begging when they’re happy over a sports win. On a Friday \nnight I would generally spend my time around the Oasis Club in Lloyd Street \nand hit up for change anyone who was slightly the worse for drink. Well, this \nnight in particular I was doing quite well, as it was a warm June evening not too \nlong after the Cup Final, and everyone was in a good mood. \nNow about half eleven that night I spied a stranger all turned out for dancing, \nmaking his way from the club with a lady friend. I reckoned they might be good \nfor a tanner, so made my approach. I gave them the spiel and waited. The man \nlooked at me and I understood he wouldn’t be giving me any money, and I \nstepped away. It was as he turned to leave I realised that he hadn’t opened his \nmouth, and memories of Sylvia McDonald came rushing back to me in a flash. I \nwasn’t sure what to do, so I followed behind them at a distance. I didn’t try to \nhide or disguise myself, as I had long since learned, and it’s true now as it was \nback then, that no-one pays any real attention to a tramp. As I watched, I saw \nthe clearly drunken woman asking this stranger questions and each time he’d \njust look at her and she’d smile as though he’d given some reassuring answer \nand stumble on behind him. All the while he never once opened his mouth. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG010 – Vampire Killer \n10 \n \nI didn’t rightly know what to do about this. I had no weapon save my brother’s \nold pocket knife which I had kept sharp all these years, and while I was pretty \nsure of what I was seeing, I was still hesitant to attack with no provocation and \nno plan. As we walked, I kept an eye out for any discarded wood or timber and, \nsure enough, noticed a broken wooden palette partially sticking out of a bin. I \ngrabbed a long shard and used my knife to quickly hack it to a point, ignoring \nthe splinters. While I had not, at that time, done much research into the \ncreatures I faced, believing as I did my experience as a youth to be the product \nof a disturbed mental state, I was still aware of their supposed weakness to \nwooden stakes. I had now followed the vampire, who I would later find out \ncalled itself Robert Arden, and its victim back to the building where it \napparently lived. It let itself in the front door and the woman followed. I wasn’t \nfast enough to get in before the front door closed and obviously didn’t have a \nkey, so I went round the windows and, luckily, it seemed the vampire lived on \nthe ground floor. \nI watched through the window as it led its victim into a sparsely furnished \nliving room. I couldn’t see any obvious signs of previous slaughter, but I \nremembered how cleanly Sylvia McDonald had sucked up all the blood from \nmy brother, so this did not strike me as odd. I gently tried the window and \nfound it locked, so searched the garden for the heaviest stone I could find and \nwatched what was happening inside. I had to be sure. Soon enough Robert \nArden moved smoothly behind its now-seated prey, and finally opened its \nmouth to reveal those rows of shark-like teeth I knew would be there. I hurled \nthe rock I held through the window, showering the room w", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 6, "chunk_count": 10, "chars": 4500}}
