How long have you been \nmoving now? Seconds? Years? Your lungs still burn and beg you to succumb. \n[A deep creaking growl] \n[Swimming falters] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nSomething moves. Something deep and old, and larger than your frostbitten \nimagination can conceive. You cannot see it, you cannot hear it, but you feel it. \nThe water shifts and pushes against you, spinning you around, and tearing \napart your thin idea of up and down. It is coming closer, its smooth motion \nrelentless as an iron bell tolling in the silence. It is close. \n[Deep pulsing sounds and creaks from the behemoth] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nCloser. \nIt is here. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 195 – Adrift \n \n5 \nYou can feel its titanic bulk moving past, just below you. Or perhaps above. It \nalmost brushes against you and, despite the pressure of the water all around \nyou, you cannot fight the frantic instinct to run. \n[Flailing swimming; the behemoth sounds continue] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nYour legs begin to move, flailing, and where your feet press against it you feel \nits skin, rough and leathery, strangely almost dry despite the ocean through \nwhich it moves, and sharp enough that you feel it tear through the soft flesh \non the soles of your feet. There is no pain, simply a wave of sickened nausea \nthat passes up through your legs and into your stomach. You keep moving, \nlimbs splaying in that strange pseudo-run, moving along it, and begging for this \nthing to end. Sometimes your feet do not land upon its skin, but press on \nsomething else. Something smooth and hard that feels like bone. Or tooth. \n[The behemoth sounds fade; swimming pauses] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nAnd then it is gone, passed away from you, and out into the expanse of dark \nand quiet cold. You cannot stay down here. The darkness hides terrible things, \nand your whole chest screams for air. You take a moment and focus, \nconcentrate on the feeling of the water around you, the gentle pull that \npromises to be down, and then you begin to swim, a desperate crawl up \nthrough the black towards the vague hope of a surface. \n[Swimming] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 195 – Adrift \n \n6 \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nYou do not know how long you have been swimming, how far you have \nclimbed, but when you thrust your hand forward you feel something change. It \nis a sudden release, a weightless freedom that seems so alien to you now. \n[Surface water splashes start] \n[Sounds of coughing and gasping for air] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nA new panic begins to overtake you, but it is too late, as your whole body rips \nthrough the unbroken surface of the sea and into open air. \nYou feel dark water explode from your throat in something that is half-\nscreaming, half-disgorging foul and icy liquid, and you take a breath. The air \nburns, perhaps a new feeling, or perhaps one long forgotten, and you open \nyour eyes. \n[Splashing and gasping calms] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nThere is… nothing. \nYou look around you, neck twisting violently, trying to take it all in, but the \nocean that stretches away is smooth against the reddened sky, unchanging. \n[Faint sobbing gasps and some splashes] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nThere is nothing else.
