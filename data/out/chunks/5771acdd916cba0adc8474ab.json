So. \nPerhaps you were right about the Extinction. I’ve been hunting it for decades \nnow, and while I have seen evidence of its influence in other powers, I have \nnever found anything to genuinely prove its emergence as a true power of its \nown. Perhaps it is an existential fear that flows through the others like a vein of \nore, or perhaps the birth of such things is longer and more complicated than I \nbelieved. For all that, though, I cannot regret at the time I have spent seeking \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 157 – Rotten Core \nit. I have done my duty, and none may ask more of me. I am proud of the work \nwe have done, and it has been an honor to do it alongside you. \nGoodbye, Gertrude. May you find your rest where no shadows are cast, and no \neyes may see you slumber. \nARCHIVIST \nStatement ends. \nThis, er… this changes things. I – I think. If Martin found this- read it already, \nthen perhaps he’s having second thoughts about – about Peter and the \nExtinction. This – this could be a cry for help, his way of asking me to follow \nhim without Peter knowing, or… or what? I don’t understand. Martin’s been \nquite clear he doesn’t want my help. Am I just hearing what I want to hear? I \nneed a second opinion, but… Basira and Daisy are… out… somewhere. They left \nin a hurry and didn’t tell me why, now their phones are going to voicemail. \nMaybe they’re just on the Underground, and probably – that doesn’t help me \nnow. \n(Sigh) I need someone I can trust. \n(The Archivist sighs heavily.) \n[Tape clicks off. Tape clicks on. The Archivist is now outside – we can hear the \ngentle hum of traffic in the background.] \nGEORGIE \nNo, John, you’ve done enough! \nARCHIVIST \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 157 – Rotten Core \nI just need to talk to – \nGEORGIE \nWhat don’t you understand? She mutilated herself to get out of that place, and \nthere is absolutely no way I’m letting you involve her again. \nARCHIVIST \nLook, is she here or not? She – she said she was staying with you. \nGEORGIE \nYes, she’s here. \nARCHIVIST \nReally? Where’s all her stuff? \nGEORGIE \nBedroom. Why? \nARCHIVIST \nNo, I just… \n[Some static] \nOh. Oh, I’m sorry, I didn’t – I didn’t realize you were to-together. \nGEORGIE \nThat’s ‘cause it’s none of your business. Now leave. \nARCHIVIST \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 157 – Rotten Core \nPlease, Georgie, it’s not – I just need to know I’m not overreacting to \nsomething. I need an outside perspective. \nGEORGIE \nSure, well, here’s one. Get out of my flat. \n[A door opens.] \nMELANIE \nOh – what’s go… what’s going on? You – you woke the Admiral. \nGEORGIE \n(A gentler tone to Melanie than when she speak to The Archivist) Hey, hey, \neasy. It’s – it’s all right, he was just leaving. \nARCHIVIST \nMelanie, I… \nMELANIE \nJohn? \nARCHIVIST \nYeah. It’s me. \nGEORGIE \nIt’s all right, Melanie. \n[Over this final exchange we can hear purring from The Admiral.] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 157 – Rotten Core \nJohn, leave. \nARCHIVIST \nI’m sorry, I just… it’s Martin. \nMELANIE \nJohn… don’t. Please. \nARCHIVIST \nNo, you’re right, I’m sorry. You alright? \nMELANIE \nYes. I’m… I’m actually doing okay. \nARCHIVIST \nThat’s good. \nMELANIE \n(Laughs) My therapist isn’t happy about it, you know. Unsurprisingly. Tried to \nhave me put away, but they, um… they let me come here. It’s – it’s been good \nfor me though I feel alright. I’m – I’m not scared anymore. \nGEORGIE \nMelanie, you don’t have to do this. \nMELANIE \nIt’s – it’s okay. He’s welcome… as a friend. But that’s it. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 157 – Rotten Core \nARCHIVIST \nRight. \nMELANIE \nBut you’re not after a friend, are you, John? \nARCHIVIST \nI need an ally. \nMELANIE \nThen I can’t help you. \nARCHIVIST \nI suppose not. \n[The Admiral meows.] \nGEORGIE \nOkay. You’re done? \nARCHIVIST \nYeah. (Sigh) Yeah, I am. \nGEORGIE \nCome on, Melanie. Let’s get you back to bed. \nARCHIVIST \nLook after yourself.
