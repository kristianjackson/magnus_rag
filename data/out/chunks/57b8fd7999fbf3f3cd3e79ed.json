It’s hard to remember now, \nbut I have to assume that I was. I mean, I must have been. As I pushed the \nancient hinges back to reveal this darkened forest, how could I not have been? \nIt stretched away forever, I think, or as close to forever as the human mind can \ncontain. The trees were long and spindly, their branches bare and reaching, as \nthey grew down towards me out of the sky, their roots pulsing upwards into \nthis roiling mass of clouds; the scorched and shattered trunks reeking of ozone. \nI found The Journal of a Plague Year when I was seventeen. I was lucky, I \nsuppose, that it wasn’t anything worse. It infected the house, of course, \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG091 – The Coming Storm \n7 \n \nbrought it crashing down upon my parents in a collapse of diseased brick and \nseptic foundations, but I escaped. And more than that, my eyes were opened \nto the powers that might save me. Might protect me from a past that followed \nme so brightly I could barely see it. But I knew that Filth was not for me. \nBuzzing flies and rot disgusted me, but they never spoke to my soul. I threw \nthe book into a sewer, and began my hunt. \nThe Boneturner’s Tale was next. Found tucked away in a waterlogged library \nbasement, and deposited back in another. I played with it, but when I tried to \nshift the bits of myself I thought might set me free, the only shapes I could \nform with them were laced with that horrid, hunting fractal. My experiments \nweren’t entirely pointless, though, they did have a truth to me. I learned that I \nwas more than capable of killing, if it brought me closer to what I needed. \nI spent some time with a small grey volume, I think it was in Cyrillic, that \ndecided it was at home amongst my bookshelves. I couldn’t read it, of course, \nbut… when it tried to read me back, I buried it on a lonely stretch of moorland. \nFinally I found what I was searching for. In the back of a Chichester bookshop, I \nfound my release. Ex Altiora. ‘From the Heights’. The owner didn’t want to part \nwith it, a nasty, grubby little man who stank of sweat and self-importance, but \nI got it. And at last I had what I needed. \nThe thing that chased me, you see, it was an arcing branch of the Twisting \nDeceit, taken shape to follow me. But the shape it had taken more rightly \nbelonged to the sky. To those same vast unknowable heights that blessed book \nwanted to take me. Falling had always held a special place in my heart, that \nwonderful border between terror and delight. When my parents would take \nme to the fair, I always found my way to the highest ride, the one that would \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG091 – The Coming Storm \n8 \n \njust send me plummeting. It wasn’t simply the rush of adrenaline, but \nsomething, something deeper, something that just gripped my soul with this \necstatic horror. And I knew within that book was something that could not only \nrelease me from my pursuer, but chain my being to that rush of wind and \nvertigo forever. \nI don’t remember that night in detail. The two most important events in my \nlife, and I have clear memories of neither. I know it was the first storm, the first \nreal storm, I had seen for almost ten years, but nothing else remains in my \nmind. There are echoes of resignation, I think, almost desperation. That can’t \nbe right, though. What reason would I have had not to jump? Not to become \nas I am now. Perhaps I just didn’t know the true joy of vertigo. It doesn’t \nmatter. In the end I threw myself into the arms of that vast emptiness, and I \nbound my tormentor to the book. \nThat’s… that’s all, I think. Since then I’ve embraced my new life; gladly fed that \nwhich feeds me. \nA… uh, a Paris skyscraper, was it you said? I honestly, I, I can’t say I recall it in \ndetail, but that does… sounds about right. Sometimes it’s hard to keep track. \nMIKE \nHm. You know, that was… that was nice. I’m not, not usually the sort for \nspeeches. That was… pleasant change. So. \n[The sound of rushing air as the Archivist gasps for breath] \nOff you go, then. \nARCHIVIST \nI, er… You –", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 2, "chunk_count": 5, "chars": 4094}}
