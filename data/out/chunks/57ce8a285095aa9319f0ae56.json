Well, it’s an \nobvious thing to say that a computer cannot feel, but it’s true. No sequence of \ndistinct ones and zeroes can replicate the swirling cocktail of chemicals and, \nyou know, nerves, that is a human being. Or any other animal for that matter. \nOr nothing about humanity is binary. \nARCHIVIST \nRight. So, you work in computers, then? \nTESSA \nSorry, I, um... it’s been a while since I talked to someone in person. Been \nspending a lot of time in my own head. You know? Used to just dumping \ninformation when I get the chance. I have a blog actually, but I haven’t posted \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 065 – Binary \n4 \n \nfor almost a year. Almost too embarrassed to now. Assuming I’m not losing my \nmind, of course. \nARCHIVIST \nYes, I hear that a lot too. \nTESSA \nWell, that’s what’s really terrifying, isn’t it? Your mind is all you are. There’s no \nback-up, no reset if it goes. I’m not just talking about madness as it appears, \nbut what it is from inside. The way people talk about it, it’s like you have to \nthink you’re sane, that our mind is everything we perceive, everything we are. \nWell, that means you can never know when your grasp might be slipping. I’m \nnot convinced that’s it though. Or maybe deep down, somewhere inside, you \nunderstand what’s happening to you and I, um... I don’t know which scares me \nmore. \nARCHIVIST \nLook, I don’t want to rush you, but– \nTESSA \nI’ve got a lot of friends whose retirement plans basically comes down to \nuploading their minds into a computer and living forever in a virtual world. \nThey’re so sure it’s just around the corner. Well, I’ve never had the heart to tell \nthem it’s impossible, that the human brain is a wet mess of analogue signal \ninterpretation that is as far removed from the clean logics of digital processing \nas it’s possible to be. We’ve tricked ourselves into thinking that computers and \npeople have anything in common, but no matter how good we may program \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 065 – Binary \n5 \n \nthem to be at pretending to think like us, that’s all it’ll ever be. Crossing the \nline from meat and chemicals into pure digital systems is impossible, and \neverything else just sophisticated programming – a... an illusion. \nARCHIVIST \nI mean, that’s fascinating, Ms Winters, but I must politely ask you to start your \nstatement. \nTESSA \nWhat do you think I’ve been doing? \nARCHIVIST \nRam– Traditionally our concerns are with the particulars of the supernatural \nincident. Its origins and manifestations. \nTESSA \nI’m giving you context. \nARCHIVIST \nFine. In that case I still need to make the official notations. Statement of Tessa \nWinters regarding a strange computer program she downloaded from the \ndeep web three months ago. Is that accurate? \nTESSA \n(Snorts) Well, first off, I didn’t find it on the deep web. God, it’s like talking to \nmy grandpa. Well, let me explain something quickly.
