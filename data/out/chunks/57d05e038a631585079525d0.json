Original statement given June 3rd 2003. Audio recording by \nJonathan Sims, Head Archivist of the Magnus Institute, London. \nStatement begins. \nARCHIVIST (STATEMENT) \n\nThanks for letting me do this. I mean, I know you let anyone record a \nstatement. That’s why you’re the Magnus Institute! So I could have just made \nsomething up, I guess. But I don’t want to waste your time or irritate you guys. \nI mean, I’m a big fan of your work. Never had the academic chops to get access \nto your library or anything, but when all those statements were leaked back in \n’99… I know all the letters pages called you crackpots, but I know. Yeah? I get \nit. I read them all, start to finish, and sure there’s a lot of nonsense in there, a \nlot of bad acid trips and liars, but in the middle, at the core of them, there was \nsomething there. There are things that go bump in the night and now I think \nI’ve got one to share with you. \nSo I’m kind of an artist. I like to use the detritus of mankind’s time on this \nplanet to craft its own reflection back at itself, yeah? So I take what others \nconsider garbage and use it to send a message to the puppetmasters and fat \ncats who hold our lives in the palm of their hand and play with our society like \na chess game. A message of art. You know what I’m talking about. I bet you \nhave a ton in your archive about the Illuminati. That’s why they smeared you \nso hard. I’m not asking to look at them or anything; I’m just letting you know \nthat I get it. Yeah? I get it. \nSo, anyway, I spend a lot of time at the dump. Not so much those huge iron \nskips or the bottle bank – I mean, like I don’t have enough bottles in my studio \nalready - but you know the bit in the middle where they sell stuff. All the stuff \nthat really skirts the line between trash and treasure. Mirrors that are \ntarnished but still good. Old furniture just a bit too scuffed for the charity shop. \nYou can get amazing things there for almost nothing if you look hard and aren’t \ntoo picky. And when you’re making art you don’t need to be picky. If \nsomething’s not perfect, you can make it perfect.
