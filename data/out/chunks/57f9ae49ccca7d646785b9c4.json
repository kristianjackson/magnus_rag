It doesn’t really matter. \nFor what it’s worth, I don’t think he did it. I won’t deny it makes sense from the \noutside but I remember how devastated he was when she disappeared. He \nstarted drinking a lot. I think he did try to look after me as best he could but \nmost nights he just ended up passed out in his chair. That was also when he \nstarted spending a lot of time in the shed. I’d never really paid it much \nattention before. As far as I was concerned the sturdy wooden structure was \njust the home of spiders’ nests and the rusted garden tools my parents would \nuse once a year to attack the overgrown wilderness that was our back garden. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG009 – A Father’s Love \n6 \n \nBut soon after my mother’s disappearance, a sturdy new padlock was placed \non the door and my father spent a lot of time inside. He told me he was \nwoodworking and sometimes I’d hear the sounds of power tools from inside \nand he’d present me with some small wooden token he had made, but mostly \nthere was silence. It should probably have bothered me more than it did, the \nhours he spent in there, and that odd smell I sometimes noticed, like tinned \nmeat. But I never really paid it much attention, and I had my own grief to deal \nwith. \nHe was gone most nights as well. Often I would wake up from one of my \nnightmares to find the house silent and empty. I would look for him and he \nwould be gone. I never despaired at this, for some reason, not like I had when \nmy mother vanished. I knew he would return eventually, when he was finished \nwith what I had decided must be ‘police business’. Sometimes I’d lie awake \nuntil he returned. Once, as I lay awake, I heard him come into my room. I \npretended to be asleep. I don’t know why, but I thought I’d be in trouble if he \nfound out I was awake. He walked over to me, and gently stroked my face. His \nhands smelled strange. Back then I didn’t know the scent of blood, and mixed \nwith that faint, saline smell of brackish water. He whispered to me then, when \nhe thought I was asleep, promised to protect me, to make sure that “it \nwouldn’t get me too”. There was a strangled sound to his words; I think he \nmight have been crying. As he left, I opened my eyes just enough to see him. \nHe stood by the door, his face in his hands, wearing light grey overalls that \nwere stained with a thick, black substance. I often wish I’d asked him about \nthat night. I wonder, if he’d known I was awake, if I had asked him in that \nmoment of weakness… Well, it’s far too late for that now. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG009 – A Father’s Love \n7 \n \nOver the next couple of years I noticed that my father seemed to be injured \nquite a lot and there was rarely a time when he didn’t have some sort of \nplaster, bandage or bruise visible. I’d also occasionally find small bloodspots or \nsmears on the floors or tables, especially in the hall. I got very good at cleaning \nthem, and it never occurred to me to pay much attention to where they came \nfrom – I just assumed the blood was my father’s. He started staying home \nduring the day and told me he’d been permanently assigned to the night shift. I \nbelieved him, of course, and it was only after his arrest that I discovered that \nhad been the point he’d resigned his job on the police force. I don’t know \nwhere the money came from after that but we always seemed to have enough. \nKnowing what I know now, it sounds awful to say, but those were some of the \nhappiest years of my childhood. I’d lost my mother, but my father doted on me \nand together it seemed like we would get past our pain. I know I’ve made him \nsound like an alcoholic recluse who lived in the shed, but those were generally \nnocturnal activities for him. During the day was time he spent with me. \nThere was only one time I recall him going into the shed during the day. This \nwas a couple of years after my mother’s disappearance, and I must have been \nabout ten. The phone in the kitchen started ringing and my father was upstairs. \nI had recently received permission from my father to answer the phone, so I \nwas excited to take up my new responsibility. I picked up the handset and said \nmy memorised phone script into the receiver: “Hello, Montauk residence!” A \nman’s voice asked to speak with my father. It was a breathy voice, like that of \nan old man, and at the time I decided he had a German accent, though, when I \nwas young a lot of different nationalities and accents were", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 3, "chunk_count": 10, "chars": 4500}}
