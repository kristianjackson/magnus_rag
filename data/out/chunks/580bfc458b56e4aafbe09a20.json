Sad old thing, but she didn’t deserve that. Always \nwondered what would have happened if I’d gotten there a bit sooner. Trouble \nis, once they’ve really got their teeth into you, you’re as good as dead even \nthey don’t drain you. Gushing on the floor or bloating a vampire’s belly. \nDoesn’t make much difference to the poor fool bleeding out. \nI’ve often wondered if I was mad, you know. I mean, no one else seems to \nhave seen these things and I’ve found plenty across my life. Perhaps I just got \nthe smell of them. Like, no one else ever really got away, and my early escape \nfrom Sylvia Macdonald gave me a sense that could pick them out. There’s a \nsharpness to them. They’re hunters. But over the years, I’ve become a hunter \nas well, and maybe predators recognise each other. All I know is these days I \n\nThe Magnus Archives –056 – Children of the Night \n3 \n \ncan almost smell the blood coming off them. That’s not to say I can’t be wrong \nthough. I can be very wrong indeed. \nI found Alard Dupont in the summer of 1982, and murdered him shortly \nafterwards. I use the word ‘murder’ here where I’ve not before, because he \nwas the only one I’ve killed I know to have been human. In most ways, I regret \nhis death, but there is a certain comfort to it. If I was just a serial killer with a \nhallucination, I don’t see why my mind wouldn’t have made Dupont a vampire \nas well. The fact I was able to kill normal people reassures me that the \ncreatures I hunt are real. Do you understand? \nThat’s not to say that the death of Alard Dupont wasn’t the result of several \nextremely bad decisions on my part. \nIn the early ‘80s I was deep in the grip of my twin addictions. As I mentioned, \nafter a while the hunt became an addiction of its own. Of the two, I have \nalways found heroin the easier one to quit. Heroin is calm. It’s a small chunk of \npeace in a world that’s full of nothing but hard edges. It’s hard to put that \ndown permanently. But the hunt? The hunt is a purpose. It’s not just a way to \nget through the day; it’s a reason for there to be a day at all. I tried to give it up \nfor a while after Dupont, but it burned in me far deeper than any itch I got \nwhen I was clucking.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 0, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 3286}}
