It was \nsurprisingly easy, and once I had gotten them an inch or two apart, something \nmust have tripped and they slid the rest of the way on their own. The other \nside was the wall of the tunnel. But rather than the normal cables and \nconstruction you would expect from the Underground, this was bare earth. It \nwas slick with damp, and instead of the two-foot gap you would expect to be \nbetween the door and the wall, it came right up to the lip of it. There was no \nclearance at all: the doors seemed to be completely flush with this solid barrier \nof soil. \n\nAs it became clear to me that there was no way I was going to be able to get \nout of any of the side exits, I was faced, to my mind, with three choices. I could \nsit there and wait, at the mercy of whatever situation I had found myself in. I \ncould head through the other carriages leading towards the rear of the train \nand hope I could get off there and walk back along the tunnel. Or I could do \nthe same thing heading towards the front of the train, hoping that there was \nsomeone in the driver’s compartment that could explain what was going on. I \npicked the third option. It was, of course, a mistake. \nThe doors between the carriages were tiny, and each bore several bright \nwarning signs promising death or prosecution if they were used incorrectly. I \nignored these and opened the one leading towards the front of the train. The \ngap between the cars was slick with mud and a thin rain of dirt trickled down \nfrom the roof of the tunnel. I opened the next door and stepped inside. \nIt was even dirtier in this carriage than in the one I had left, with a distinct layer \nof muddy soil over everything that I could see. The silence had been replaced \nby a new noise, a sort of creaking groan that sounded like it was coming from \nthe train itself. It was only later I learned that this is what metal sounds like \nwhen under immense strain. I walked briskly through this car, seeing nothing \nthat caught my attention, and opened the next door at the other end, \ncontinuing my journey towards the driver. I hadn’t really seen how long the \ntrain was when I got in, but I had been in the middle of platform so I didn’t \nthink it could be more than four or five carriages to the front. This door \nseemed wedged quite firmly shut, and it was only with a great deal of effort \nthat I was able to pull it open. I almost fell into the space between them while \ntrying to force the next one open. I am sure that if I had done so I would be \ndead. \n\nWhen I got into this one the first thing I noticed was the ceiling. In certain \nplaces it seemed to have buckled slightly with large dents in the material \npushing down. Many of the lights and windows were broken and the whole of \nthe carriage seemed to be bent and twisted slightly, like it was being crushed. \nThe sound of metal fatigue was stronger here, and I realised with a start that \nthis was exactly what was happening. If it got worse the further through I \nwent, there was a good chance the driver, if there was one, had already been \ncrushed, or at the very least trapped beyond my reach. I turned to go back the \nway I had come, but the door had swung shut, and in the few seconds it had \ntaken me to understand what was happening, the pressure had already \nwarped the frame too much. It was jammed shut, and no amount of kicking \nwas going to move it. \nI was becoming desperate, and looked around for anything I could see that \nmight be a way out. What I saw instead, right at the other end, was a person. It \nwas hard to make out any details, as all the lights in that section were already \nshattered, but they were sat very still. I called out but there was no response. I \nmade my way over to them, though by the time I reached that part of the \ncarriage I was having to bend down to avoid parts of the ceiling. It appeared to \nbe a man, probably late fifties, early sixties, with a scraggly grey beard and \nwhat had once been a nice jacket. He had sunken blue eyes, and the seat \naround him had twisted so much it was now holding him in place at an angle \nthat looked very painful. The armrests were digging hard into the flesh of his \nleg, and his back was crooked. Despite this, he seemed to be breathing. \nWhen he didn’t respond to my voice, I touched him lightly on the shoulder. His \neyes opened slowly, and locked on mine.
