The doctors told me \nI’d probably always have a limp, as I’m sure you’ve noticed, but it wasn’t \ninfected and there wasn’t the nerve damage they’d been afraid of. So, all told, \nit was a pretty good wound to get. \nAfter a few weeks, I was walking on without too much pain and the nurses \nadvised me to start taking the occasional walk around Alexandria. I did so, but \nbetween the locals and the army, it was a crowded, noisy place, even at night. I \ntook to taking my walks further and further from the hospital and the city \ncentre, and occasionally I’d find myself wandering some way beyond the city \nlimits, at least as far as my leg would allow. It was still hot, even in late \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 053 - Crusader \n9 \n \nDecember, but beyond the edge of the city, there was a peaceful quiet that I \njust couldn’t find anywhere else. \nIt was two days before I was due to return to active duty that it happened. I’d \nbeen restless all week and I couldn’t seem to settle down or focus on anything. \nOnce I got out near Pompey’s Pillar, the crowds seemed to disperse and my \nmind finally cleared a bit. I kept walking, though not paying any real attention \nto my surroundings, until I found myself rather lost. After several hours, my leg \nwas starting to ache badly and I took a moment or two to rest against a nearby \ndoor. The wood of the door was old and dry and creaked as I put my weight \nagainst it. I didn’t even notice it buckling until it was too late. The next thing I \nknew, I was lying face down in a dingy basement, my leg screaming in fresh \npain. It wasn’t broken again, which was a relief, but I still had to sit there for a \nwhile, recovering from my fall. N-nobody seemed to have noticed what had \nhappened, or at least they didn’t care, and I took a few moments to look at \nexactly where I was. \nThe basement looked old, really old. I’m not an expert on Egyptian \narchitecture, but it didn’t look much like the rest of Alexandria. More than \nthat, aside from the now broken door, there didn’t seem to be any entrance to \nthe place, or anything connecting it to the building above. It was dry and cool \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 053 - Crusader \n10 \n \nand there didn’t seem to be anything else of note, except for an old grate \nmade of brass, or maybe bronze, that I assumed led to the city’s sewer system. \nIt was, as I finally, painfully was dragging myself to my feet, that I saw it. From \nsomewhere far beyond the grate, as the setting sun fell on it, came the glint of \nsomething round and white. It was only for a second and if I hadn’t spent so \nlong training to spot objects at a distance, I probably wouldn’t have noticed it, \nbut there was definitely something there. I approached the metal grate, \nexpecting to smell the sewer beyond, but instead there came the scent of \nsomething else. At that point, I had no idea what it was, but I would have \ndescribed it as not unlike wood. I tested the grate and found it came away \neasily from the floor, leaving a hole large enough to climb through without any \nproblems. \nI had taken to keeping a torch with me on my walks, as I sometimes had a \ntendency to wander too far and so I’d be walking back in the dark. Shining it \ninto the now open hole revealed what looked to be an old tunnel. Whether it \nwas manmade, a naturally occurring cave, or somewhere in between, I \ncouldn’t say, but it was easily big enough for me to walk down and, once again, \nI saw that glint of pale white a long way down.
