The walls were covered in fractal drawings, every \nsurface was piled high with them and pencil shavings littered the floor. The \ninquest ruled his death a suicide, although the coroner wasn’t able to identify \nthe tool that had made the cuts on his arms or why he had such a look of fear \non his face. \nThis is why the apparent disappearance of Raymond Fielding worried me so \nmuch. I was younger than my father had been but still had that possibility \nwithin me. This train of thought was likely why I wasn’t paying as much \nattention as I should have been where I was stepping and I slipped on the wet \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG008 – Burned Out \n6 \n \nsection of flooring that I had just cleaned. I fell forward, hitting my head badly. \nI don’t think I was unconscious for more than a few seconds but when I woke \nup I was bleeding from a deep cut on my temple. I tried to make it to my car \nbut I was so dizzy just standing up that it was clear driving was out of the \nquestion. So I called for an ambulance. It arrived quickly and it took me to the \nJohn Radcliffe Hospital. \nWhen I got there, they were very responsive and quickly determined that I had \nquite a severe concussion, so I was kept overnight for observation. I told my \ndoctor everything about my encounter with Raymond Fielding. If it was early \nsigns of any developing schizophrenia, I wanted to know as soon as possible. \nThe doctor listened closely and said it was unlikely, as it would be surprising if I \ndeveloped full hallucinations so abruptly, but that they were keeping me under \nobservation. I noticed as I was explaining my experience, the nurse taking my \nblood pressure seemed to be listening intently, though she left before I could \nask her why. \nI stayed in that hospital for another two days. Sam wanted to cut short her trip \nwhen she heard about my concussion, but I told her that any real danger had \npassed and I should be fine until the end of her conference, so I was mostly on \nmy own for that time. It was the morning before she was due to return that I \nsaw the nurse again. I’d just had the news that the tests had all come back fine, \nso I was being discharged and she came in to give me a final check. \nShe asked me if I was sure the man who had come to the house on Hill Top \nRoad had called himself Raymond Fielding. I told her yes, and that I’d even \nseen his signature on the deed to the land, but that I didn’t know any of the \nhistory of the place. She got very quiet and sat down. This nurse was an older \nwoman, Malaysian I think and I would have guessed in her fifties, though I \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG008 – Burned Out \n7 \n \ndidn’t ask. She said her family had lived on Hill Top Road for a long time now \nand she knew the place I was working. In the 1960s, the house that had stood \nthere had belonged to a man named Raymond Fielding. He was a devout \nchurchgoer and had used it as a halfway house on behalf of the local diocese, \nlooking after teenage runaways and young people with mental problems. The \nneighbourhood apparently hadn’t liked it, as its residents often got into \ntrouble and Hill Top Road had started to get something of a reputation for it. \nNobody ever said a word against Raymond himself though, who was by all \naccounts such a kind and gentle soul as to be almost universally beloved. \nNobody was sure exactly when Agnes moved in; some even said she was \nRaymond’s actual daughter, as the two of them looked something alike and \nshe was younger than most of the other kids living there. She couldn’t have \nbeen more than eleven when she turned up and didn’t really talk, other than \nto tell people her name if asked. Everyone just started to notice this child with \nmousey brown pigtails staring at them through the windows of Raymond’s \nhouse. As far as anyone could tell that’s all she ever seemed to do – stare at \npeople from the windows. It was unsettling but no-one had any real problem \nwith it. \nOver the next few years, the kids at the halfway house stopped causing \nproblems in the area around Hill Top Road. It wasn’t an obvious change, but \ngradually the people living there were seen less and less. Raymond was still \nthere and still seemed perfectly cheery. If anyone asked him about a resident \nwho hadn’t been around for a while, he’d explain that they’d moved on or \nfound a place of their own, and no-one really cared enough to follow up on his \ninform", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 3, "chunk_count": 9, "chars": 4500}}
