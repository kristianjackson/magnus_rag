I reached over to try and slide it \nback into place, but my gloved hand slipped, and as I tried to grip it, I swear I \nbarely touched the thing, but the wooden top slid further off, releasing a dusty \ncloud of air that sent me into a coughing fit. The air was dry and hot in a way \nthat seemed rather alarming in the frigid shipping container. The inside was \ndark, the light from the entrance not reaching this far back. I shined my light in \nand to my surprise, the crate appeared to be completely empty. I didn’t \nremember it listed on the manifest, but if it didn’t contain anything there \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 066 – Held in Customs \n \n4 \n \nwasn’t necessarily a reason for it to be. I turned back to face Salesa with a \nshrug. \nHe no longer looked angry. Instead, his face now had a look of concern. I \nassumed he was worried I’d found something suspicious, but I shook my head \nand told him that if he got his documents in order by tomorrow, he could be \non his way no problem. Otherwise it was going to get more complicated. The \nlook on his face didn’t change. I began to walk out – I had plenty more work to \ndo that day – when he grabbed my arm. His grip was just as strong as I would \nhave guessed and for a second, I was suddenly afraid he was going to kill me. \nInstead he looked me in the eyes for a long moment before he said, very softly, \n“Don’t go to sleep.” \nI shook my head, assuming that was meant to be some sort of threat, and gave \nhim a look that tried to tell him I wasn’t scared. Of course, I was, but either \nway he didn’t seem to notice. He just looked at me and repeated himself. \nI was understandably nervous after that little encounter, but I live in a ground \nfloor flat in a rather rough area, so I have several locks, a sturdy door and bars \non the window, all of which I triple checked before turning in that night. \nEverything seemed to be in order, so I had a few shots of vodka to calm my \nnerves and, well, I turned in. Looking back on it now, the thing I find hardest to \nbelieve is how well I slept. It was a restful night’s sleep and I didn’t dream. \nThe pain in my legs was what woke me. The dull cramp dragged me slowly \nfrom unconsciousness and I tried to shift them into a more comfortable \nposition under the covers. As I tried, I gradually realised that I couldn’t. They \nwere pressed right up against a hard surface. My eyes began to flutter open \nand I realised that, instead of my pillow, my cheek was pressed against \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 066 – Held in Customs \n \n5 \n \nsomething coarse and rigid. Something that, when I tried to move, greeted me \nwith the needling sharpness of splinters. \nIt was dark. Opening my eyes didn’t do much to change what I could see. My \nhands pressed against unvarnished wood and I felt a rising panic in the back of \nmy mind. I think, deep down, I already knew exactly where I was, but I still \ntried steadily, one at a time, to move every limb and part of my body, hoping \ndesperately that one of them would pass out into open air and reassure me \nthat I wasn’t trapped within that small wooden cube. But I could barely move \nany of them, and it soon became apparent that my prison was indeed a sturdy \nwooden crate. \nI started to shout for help then. The sound was jarring, the echo muted by the \nclose confines of the walls, and my cries seemed incredibly loud to me. I called \nout again and again, but nobody came. After a few minutes, I suddenly had the \nhorrid thought that maybe I had been buried alive and I might have limited air. \nThat shut me up very quickly and instead I started to listen closely for any \nsound of movement. \nNothing. \nYou know, it’s strange. It took me a long time to make the connection with the \ncrate I had stumbled across in Salesa’s shipping container. I was so disoriented \nby my awakening that the idea that this was his doing took a surprisingly long \ntime to come. Once it did though, I began to feel rage building. I had the \nmemory of the lid that hadn’t been secured and, taking a moment to orientate \nmyself, I began to push up on the wood directly above me. It didn’t budge a \nmillimetre. Either it had been nailed down or someone had placed a heavy \nweight on top of it. Or both.
