It was the most painful experience of my life. I \nmean, I’m sure it’s nothing to you, but I’d never had my lungs try to burn me \nalive from the inside out before. I survived, though, and you know the rest. I’m \nnot sure exactly how it manifested on your end, but you certainly seemed to \nget the message. I kept the circle over the years, laced it through with signs \nand symbology of The Desolation to ward off the worst of the side effects and \nkeep its attentions elsewhere. \nARTHUR \nDon’t envy whoever broke it. \nGERTRUDE \nYes. It went very badly for them indeed. \nARTHUR \nSo where was it, in the end? I spent years looking for it. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 145 – Infectious Doubts \n \n9 \n \nGERTRUDE \nNowhere special: the middle of a forest in the Scottish Highlands – farthest \nplace I could find from anything and anyone. \nARTHUR \n(Chuckles) Yeah, fair play. Not like we were ever going to find that. \nGERTRUDE \nSo, your turn. \nARTHUR \n(Sighs) Go on. \nGERTRUDE \nWhat was Agnes like? \nARTHUR \nWhat? \nGERTRUDE \nWell, for all The Web bound us together, I never actually met her. What was \nshe like? \nARTHUR \nI... I don’t know, not really. You got as many answers to that as folks who met \nher. Never really knew what she felt about any of it, not really, not in her own \nwords. Guess that’s the thing about being the chosen one. I mean, Agnes was \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 145 – Infectious Doubts \n \n10 \n \nalways quiet, but even if you spend all day every day throwing out \ncommandments and laying down parables, at the end of it you’re always just \nthe point of someone else’s story – everyone clamouring to say what you \nwere, what you meant, and your thoughts on it all don’t mean nothing. \nGERTRUDE \nAnd were you this introspective when she was alive? \nARTHUR \nThat’s the thing about a fall from grace, isn’t it? Makes you look at things from \na new angle. I miss her; I’ll tell you that for nothing. Wish I’d ... I don’t know, \nactually known her when she was alive. Maybe that coffee shop twit did have a \npoint after all. I can tell you what I saw, at least. \nGERTRUDE \nWhich was? \nARTHUR \nI saw the sun – so much power and fire and rage inside of her, enough to burn \nthe world and leave it nothing but desert. But to look at her, oh, it was too \nmuch for most, but it seemed so still, so stable. But it wasn’t calm; it was just \ndistant. She never told us how she felt about being bound to you, never even \ncalled you by name, just called you her anchor, the thing weighing her down \nand tying her to this world, stopping her destiny. \nGERTRUDE \nHm, I’m surprised you didn’t come for me immediately. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 145 – Infectious Doubts \n \n11 \n \nARTHUR \nCome for you? \nWe ended up protecting you more often than not! Diego was convinced if you \ndied a violent death it would be catastrophic for Agnes. He even talked me \nround, and I spent decades convincing the others to wait it out – you couldn’t \noutrun age forever, and we had time. But it didn’t need to be forever, did it? \nJust long enough for a messiah to doubt. The sort of doubts that spreads to her \ndisciples. \nYou’ve never really had to bother with it, have you? You’ve got him upstairs to \npoint the way as often as not, and the rest of the time you’re just figuring out \npeople, or things that used to be people. You’ve never tried to talk with that \nEye of yours. You’ve never had to second guess a god. Cos that’s what it comes \ndown to, isn’t it? We feel its joy and its anger. It warps us and changes us and \nfeeds on us, though not in the ways we expect. The one thing it never does is \njust tell us what to do. It seeds us with this aching, impossible desire to change \nthe world, to bring it to us, and then it leaves us to guess and bicker and fight \nover how the hell you can actually do it. If it’s possible. Sometimes I think they \nunderstand us as little as we understand them. We don’t think like they do. \nGERTRUDE \nI'm not actually convinced they ‘think’ at all. \nARTHUR \nYou might be right, but Agnes did. That’s the thing about an incarnation, isn’t \nit? She was a child and person as much as she was a god. And we messed that \nright up. I still remember when Diego bought us a book on childcare.
