I barely know what Melanie and Basira look like. Or that \nweird murder-cop. How the hell am I supposed to be sure of any of them? \nARCHIVIST \n(Soft) Tim, I… I didn’t realise. I-I didn’t think. I’m sorry. \nTIM \nI mean, there’s worms and hallways and clowns, and... In some ways it doesn’t \neven register. Like, just another spook. But I can’t trust them. I’m going to \ndestroy the Circus that took my brother, and I can’t trust them to help. \nARCHIVIST \nAnd me? \nTIM \n(Snort) Well, if you’re trying to spy on us, you’re doing a pretty shitty job. You \nhaven’t been here for months. \nARCHIVIST \nThat’s not fair! Sometimes I was kidnapped. \n\nTIM \nWhich is not a good look for a spy, is it? \nARCHIVIST \nFine. \nTIM \nAnyway, you’re a spook too now, aren’t you? This place loves you too much to \nlet you get swapped. \nARCHIVIST \nWhat about Elias? Surely he’s the same? \nTIM \nOh, yeah. Great idea. (Sarcastic) Let’s just all trust Elias. \nARCHIVIST \nPoint taken. \nTIM \n(Sigh) Screw it. I know where they’re doing it. Th-The ritual. And I think they’re \nalmost ready. \nARCHIVIST \nR-right. Where? \nTIM \n\nIn the House of Wax, in Great Yarmouth. \nARCHIVIST \nOhhh… I thought it might be there, but th-the others, we, we couldn’t find any \nevidence of, of movement or, well, life. \nTIM \nI had to wait almost two weeks. But it’s there. \nARCHIVIST \nWhy do you think they’re doing it so soon? \nTIM \nSkin. That’s what they need right? They tried to take yours. \nARCHIVIST \nYes. \nTIM \nWell, last week they went on a couple of field trips to a pair of cemeteries. \nARCHIVIST \nWho did they take? \nTIM \nNew graves. No flowers. The first had a name on, no dates, no inscription. \n“George Icarus”. \n\nARCHIVIST \nI, I don’t know the name. Who was the other? (When Tim doesn’t respond) \nTim? \nTIM \nGertrude. \nARCHIVIST \nWhat? \nTIM \nYeah. \nARCHIVIST \nI-I-I… I thought she was cremated?! \nTIM \nI guess not. \n(The Archivist exhales) \nARCHIVIST \nSo they did get an Archivist’s skin after all. \nTIM \nSo, what’s the plan, Boss? \nARCHIVIST \n\nHeh. I, er... I think you’re going to like it, actually. \nTIM \nOh yeah? \nARCHIVIST \nShould be quite… cathartic. I just need to… confirm a few details. \nTIM \nFine. But you don’t cut me out! \nARCHIVIST \nI won’t. \nTIM \nI— \nARCHIVIST \nI promise! Now, um, if you’ll excuse me. \nTIM \nOh, er… er, right. \nARCHIVIST \nYes, well, you’re not the only one that knows his way around the tunnels, so… \n[Tape clicks off. Tape clicks off. The Archivist is now in the tunnels.] \nARCHIVIST \n\n(Sotto voce) Thirteen, fourteen, fifteen. Sixteen. \n(He whistles.) \n[Footsteps] \nBASIRA \nAll clear? \nARCHIVIST \nUh, yes. Yes! Uh, all clear. \n[More footsteps] \nBASIRA \nSorry, got a bit lost. Don’t know how you find your way around down here. \nARCHIVIST \nPractice. You alright, Daisy? \n(Daisy makes non-committal sounds.) \nBASIRA \nDon’t think either of us like it down here. \nARCHIVIST \nUh, well, no, me neither. Feels... \nDAISY \nEmpty. \n\nARCHIVIST \nYeah. \nBASIRA \nThat it? \nARCHIVIST \nYes! \nDAISY \nHow long have you had that shirt? \nBASIRA \nUm... \nARCHIVIST \nWhat? \nDAISY \nThat shirt. You get it in China? \nARCHIVIST \nUh, A-America. I had to borrow it, there was… there was blood. \nDAISY \nSure. \nBASIRA \n\nWhy? \nDAISY \nHmm. \nBASIRA \nShall I... I’ll leave you two alone. I… need to… have that chat with Elias. \n[Footsteps.] \nARCHIVIST \nRight. Right. Yes. So... how’ve you been? \nDAISY \n(Emotionless) Fine. Killing mannequins for Elias. And a clown. It’s been alright. \nARCHIVIST \nHas he… said anything about the plan? \nDAISY \nNo. Is there one? \nARCHIVIST \nUmm… Sort of. \n[Sound of case being unlocked] \nDAISY \n(Incredulous) Ohhh. That real? \n\nARCHIVIST \nYou tell me. \nDAISY \nWhere’d you get this? \nARCHIVIST \nG-Gertrude left it. Er, apparently for, er, this exact situation. \nDAISY \nWhere did she get it? \nARCHIVIST \nI-I find myself asking that question a lot. \nDAISY \nSo… this ritual, you’re just going to blow it up? \nARCHIVIST \nI mean, as long as you know how to... I mean, you can use this stuff? \nDAISY \n[Yeah. I reckon I can. \nARCHIVIST \nGood. \nDAISY", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 4, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 4099}}
