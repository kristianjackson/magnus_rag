She mentioned \nshe had acquired... something, for this purpose, but she gave no detail as to \nexactly what that might be. \nARCHIVIST \nAnd you can’t just... See where she put it. \n\nELIAS \nShe was... She got very good at hiding things from me. \nARCHIVIST \nHow embarrassing for you. Is there anyone else who might know what it is, or, \nor where? Aside from Leitner, or Gerard? \nELIAS \nSorry, Gerard Keay? \nARCHIVIST \nUh… yes? \nELIAS \nHow did you... Who, who told you he was working with Gertrude? \nARCHIVIST \nNo-one, I-I-I just... I read it in one of the statements. \nELIAS \nI don’t think you did. \nARCHIVIST \nBut… ah... \nELIAS \nYou just knew it. \n\nARCHIVIST \nWhat, no, I... Th— That’s not a— \nELIAS \nNo, no, no. No, John, this is good. It’s a promising development. \nARCHIVIST \nNo, No I... It’s just, it’s just… just deduction or— \nELIAS \nIs this the first time it’s happened? \nARCHIVIST \nLook, look, I don’t— Look…Haaa… Gerard’s not really a lead. He’s dead. Isn’t \nhe? \nELIAS \nYes, but I believe he and Gertrude travelled together, shortly before he passed \naway. Perhaps if we could retrace their steps, we might find something. \nARCHIVIST \nAnd by “we”, you of course mean... \nELIAS \nI’ll see if I can hunt down a few relevant statem— Ahh. \nARCHIVIST \n\nWhat? \nELIAS \n(Sigh) Melanie is on her way up here with a knife. Could you talk to her for me? \nARCHIVIST \nO—ah. S-Sorry, what? \nELIAS \nShe’s hoping that even if I see it coming she’ll still be able to overpower me. \nARCHIVIST \nAh— \nELIAS \nShe’s wrong, of course, but I’d be keen to avoid that sort of struggle. \nARCHIVIST \nShe, She’s trying to kill you? \nELIAS \nYes. Again. Even more than the others she has a visceral hatred of being \ntrapped. Regardless of how much freedom I afford her. \nARCHIVIST \nI don’t— Uh... \n[There’s a knock at the door] \n\nELIAS \nCome in, Melanie. \n[Door opens] \nMELANIE \nElias, hi, just brought— \nARCHIVIST \nAh… \nMELANIE \nWhat are you doing here? \nARCHIVIST \nPut the knife down, Melanie. Melanie! \nMELANIE \n(With anger) Get out of my way! \nARCHIVIST \nI don’t believe— This isn’t the way. \nMELANIE \nYou haven’t been here! You don’t know— \nARCHIVIST \nI was kidnapped! \n\nMELANIE \nOh. Sorry. \nARCHIVIST \nI mean, yeah El-Elias… is— \nMELANIE \nSeriously?! Seriously? You too? Has he got everyone fooled? If he dies, we die? \nIt’s not even a good lie. \nARCHIVIST \nWhy would— I mean, why would it not be true? If he’s managed to, to bind \nus… Why wouldn’t he be able to, to do that? \nMELANIE \nJohn, look at me. There is only one way out of this, and it is through him. \nARCHIVIST \nI get, I get that you hate being here, Melanie, but do you really want to trade it \nfor prison? \nMELANIE \nNo! But the way I see it, the police seem really keen not to investigate crimes \ncommitted here. \nELIAS \nThat’s actually fair. \n\nARCHIVIST \n(To Elias) Shut up! (To Melanie) Melanie, please. \nMELANIE \n(Frustrated) It’s not just being stuck here, John. It’s not just me. He’s \nmanipulating you, he’s manipulating all of us. Can you seriously not see that? \nHe’s pulling all the strings, and I don’t think there’s any other way to stop it. So \nget out of my way. \nARCHIVIST \nLook, I— I’m sorry, Melanie, but we need him. We, We will… We will find a way \nto deal with i— with him. Not today. A-And not like this. \nELIAS \nI am still here, you know. \nARCHIVIST \nAnd if you weren’t, I assume you would be watching this conversation, so... \nMelanie, we can’t do this. Not yet. \nMELANIE \nAlright. \n[The knife is set down.] \nWe’ll try it your way. But whatever your way actually is, you’d better figure it \nout fast. Because it is your fault that I’m here. Fix it, or get out of the way! \n[Door slams shut]", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 1, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 3713}}
