It is rot. I don’t know why it gets to me so; perhaps it’s precisely \nbecause I don’t think there is anything beyond the body, and even dead and \nunaware, seeing a person’s form begin to putrefy and fester – becoming just a \nhome for the crawling, feasting things – is too much for me. Perhaps it’s just an \nunaccountable phobia. Regardless of the reason, the fact is that to see the \ncorpses decaying, to see their flesh corrupted, it is… the one part of this job \nthat I find uncomfortable. So much so that I would describe reconstruction and \npreservation as my favourite part of the process. Making sure the cadaver \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG036 – Taken Ill \n3 \n \nlooks as peaceful and lifelike as possible. Make them the person they were, or \nas close as they can be while cold and senseless. Fighting off the rot. The \ninsects. The disease. \nI don’t know why I wrote disease just then. They’re dead, so they can’t be \ndiseased in the normal sense, can they? I suppose it’s just thinking about what \nhappened at the Ivy Meadows Care Home links them in my head. But it’s not \njust that, is it? That… the fear, the feeling. That tingling, squirming fear at the \nback of my mind – it feels the same when thinking of the germs that corrupt \nand twist our bodies, lurking invisibly on any table or surface, or when I saw \nthose swarming flies. How many more moved and buzzed just out of sight? I’ve \nnever had any mental health issues before, but perhaps after my experience I \nshould consult someone. I read once that OCD can come on later in life, if a \nsevere experience sets it off. I’m rambling. Disregard this first page, I’ll start \nagain. \nI work as a mortician at Baxter and Gordon Funeral Directors in Woodley. By \nrights it should now just be Baxter Funeral Directors, as William Gordon passed \naway himself about 5 years ago, leaving my uncle George running the place on \nhis own. He kept the name though, as he always said it was one of the most \nrespected in all of Manchester. God knows there was no sentimental reason to \nkeep it. From the way he talked, he and William Gordon hated each other by \nthe end, to the point where the will expressly stated that the body of William \nGordon was to be handled and prepared by Fenchurch and Sons, one of my \nuncle’s great rivals. Maybe that’s why Uncle George is so keen to keep it in the \nfamily. He hired me and my cousin Josh to help, and now Baxter and Gordon \nFuneral Directors is entirely run by Baxters. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG036 – Taken Ill \n4 \n \nI’ve been there for almost four years now and have taken over most of the \nclient-side arrangements of the business. My uncle has gotten somewhat \nbrusque in his old age and is now more suited to organising things with \nchurches and crematoria, rather than handling the recently bereaved. As such, \nI’ve gotten to know the various nursing and care homes around Woodley \nrather well. We generally get a few removals from any given one each year. \nMaybe as many as a half dozen if the winter is bad. It’s certainly our most \nreliable source of business. \nOf them all, Ivy Meadows was my favourite. For a funeral director to say she \nhas a favourite nursing home probably sounds a bit like the Grim Reaper \ntalking about his favourite hospital, but it’s true. Ivy Meadows Care Home was \non the outskirts of Woodley, where the suburbs gave way to pockets of green \ncountryside. It wasn’t remote, exactly, but it was removed enough from main \nroad that it stood alone, surrounded by rather lovely gardens on three sides, \nand a long, open field behind it. It had been a country house once, I believe, \nbut not much of the original structure remains, having been modified and \nexpanded to provide accessible accommodation for about thirty residents. It \nwas an odd building, with modern glass and concrete sections sprouting from \nold turreted brickwork, like blocky stone tumours. \nThe look of the place wasn’t why I liked it, though. No, that was the residents. \nIvy Meadows was almost entirely populated by those elderly who were \nentirely supported by the state. Most pensioners have some savings or \nproperty or family to support them, which means if they’re unable to live alone \nthey can at least afford to pay for their own care or some of it. It’s rare for a \nperson to reach that age and have literally nothing to pay for their care, but it \ndoes happen. In these cases, the state pays for them, b", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 1, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 4500}}
