It always seemed such a manly sort of pursuit. I \nmean, killing the deer or elk or whatever else was always beside the point; it \nwas just the idea of setting off into the wild, surviving out there, cooking and \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG031 – First Hunt \n2 \n \neating what you kill – it all sounded like such an adventure. I mean, I’d thought \nabout trying it in this country, but shooting pheasants with shotguns and riding \ndown foxes all seemed too much the domain of, uh, nitwits in tweed. So, if I \nwas going to go hunting, I would need to go to another country to do it. \nSomewhere where they had a few animals worth going after. Thinking about it, \nI suppose that is what happened in the end, in a perverse sort of way. And it \ndid cost poor Arden his life. \nWell, my desire to go hunting was always something of ‘someday’ project. I’m \nsure you know what I mean: those ideas you have, holidays you plan to do \n‘sometime in the future’, but they’re never timedependent and usually you \njust keep putting them off for more pressing things. So when I turned fifty back \nin February, I thought, ‘dash it all, I’m going to go hunting before I drop dead!’ \nWhen I told my friends they all thought I’d gone loopy, but I just reminded \nthem that it isn’t just the young that can be impetuous and daft. \nAnyway, over the past few years I’d become great friends with an American. \nArden Neeli was his name. We’d met on a sceptics message board and got on \nlike a house on fire. When I mentioned I was looking into impetuous hunting \ntrips, he asked how averse I was to hiking. I said not at all, I’ve a been a very \nactive sort, and he told me that in Virginia, his home state, there were a lot of \nexcellent places to go hunting, providing I didn’t mind waiting until October or \nNovember. I wasn’t exactly expecting the Grim Reaper to come knocking in the \nintervening months, so I told him it sounded lovely. \nWe spent a good long while discussing it, and finally decided to take a three \nday hike into Blue Ridge on the Appalachian Trail, and see if we could find a \ndeer or an elk for me to shoot. Nature, seclusion and guns – to my ears it \nsounded just perfect.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 0, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 3000}}
