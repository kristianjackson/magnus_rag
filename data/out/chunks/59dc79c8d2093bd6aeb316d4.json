The Magnus Archives. Episode one hundred and sixty-\ntwo: \"A Cosy Cabin.\" \n[Theme finishes] \n[Tape clicks on] \n[The sound of someone searching a shelf: bottles clink, things slide] \n[A cassette tape is rattled] \nGERARD KEAY \nHmm. \nGERTRUDE \nFind anything interesting back there? \n[As she speaks, Gerard startles, knocking down some items from \nthe shelf and bumping the running tape recorder] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 162 – A Cosy Cabin \n2 \nGERARD \nYeah, sorry, I was just, um- yeah. \nGERTRUDE \nCuriosity is a very dangerous trait in our line of work, Gerard. \n[Gertrude moves further into the room and sits down on a creaky \noffice chair] \nGERARD \nSo is ignorance. \n(Gertrude laughs) \nGERTRUDE \nWell, you’re not going to find many dark secrets in the stationery cupboard. \n[Sounds of a cupboard door sliding] \nGERARD \n(Amused) Just the recorded confession of your evil plans, then. \nGERTRUDE \nOh, I’d be something of a fool to leave that one in the recorder. \nGERARD \nI’ve never really seen you use it. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 162 – A Cosy Cabin \n3 \nGERTRUDE \nMm. It’s generally only for those statements I think might be useful to my \nsuccessor. Or, the occasional interview. \nGERARD \nSo, do I get to hear them? \nGERTRUDE \nPerhaps. If you live long enough. But somehow I doubt Elias would look \nfavourably on your application. And if I’m being quite honest— \nGERARD \nYeah, I know, I know. And I don’t want your job. \nGERTRUDE \nBelieve me, the perks aren’t worth the shackles. \nGERARD \nYeah, yeah. \n[Gertrude flips through some paper] \nGERARD (CONT’D) \nSo, what’s the verdict? \nGERTRUDE \nHm? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 162 – A Cosy Cabin \n4 \nGERARD \nOn The Travels. \nGERTRUDE \nOh- Burn it, I think. You said Mr Hampton was dead? \n[Page flip] \nGERARD \nYep- and not peacefully. \nGERTRUDE \nBut you hadn’t seen its powers? \nGERARD \nNot directly. \nGERTRUDE \nWell, given the themes of the original, I doubt it has anything that would be \nworth the danger. \nGERARD \nAnd when in doubt… \nGERTRUDE \nWell, quite. \nGERARD \nCan I use your wastepaper bin? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 162 – A Cosy Cabin \n5 \n[Paper noises] \nGERTRUDE \nYes, it’s just- \n[There’s a creak from Gertrude’s chair as she repositions] \nGERTRUDE (CONT’D) \nWait. Surely you didn’t bring it here! \nGERARD \nWell, yeah, I, uh- \nGERTRUDE \nGerard, we’ve talked about this. Bringing unvetted artifacts or books into the \nArchive is incredibly dangerous. \nGERARD \nIt’s locked away! \nGERTRUDE \nAnd I’m sure the lock is very sturdy, but that doesn’t stop it being an \nunnecessary risk. \nGERARD \n(Softly) Yeah. I’m sorry. \nGERTRUDE \nThis is exactly the sort of thing that will get you killed! \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 162 – A Cosy Cabin \n6 \nGERARD \nI said I was sorry! \n(Beat) \nGERTRUDE \nThen we’ll say no more about it. \n[She goes back to flipping through pages] \nGERTRUDE (CONT’D) \nI don’t enjoy being hard on you, but I really would rather you stayed broadly \nintact. \nGERARD \nI’m touched. You’re going soft in your old age. \nGERTRUDE \nWell, you are occasionally useful. Despite your foolishness. \nGERARD \nFlatterer. \nGERTRUDE \nHeh. You can probably burn it in the back courtyard, if you’re careful. \nGERARD \nYeah, will do. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 162 – A Cosy Cabin \n7 \nGERTRUDE \nAnd for goodness’ sake, make sure no one sees you. The last thing we need is a \nletter to Elias about book burnings. \nGERARD \nLook, if you have somewhere better to burn these books, then— \nGERTRUDE \n(Joking) Of course, Gerard! I just happened not to mention the network of \nsinister tunnels that snake beneath the Archive where I keep all my darkest \nsecrets. \nGERARD \nI mean, you joke, but there could be! It’s that kinda place. \nGERTRUDE \nI rather hope I would have found them by now. I like to think I’m not a \ncomplete incompetent. \nGERARD \nUntil dementia hits. \nGERTRUDE \nGiven my choice to confide in you, I rather suspect it already has. Go burn your \nbook! \n[She flips more pages] \n(Beat)", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 0, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 4158}}
