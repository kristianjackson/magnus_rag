I’d see him walking those \nstreets like he owned them, his pair of legbreakers in tow, and I knew there \nwas nothing that I could do about it. He knew it too. So I waited. And I waited. I \nwaited for the shot, or the knife, or the poison or the… whatever would end \nhim for good. It never came. Days turned into weeks and there he still was, as \ncocksure as ever. \nI was patient. God, I was patient, but after three weeks I had almost written off \nthat useless old bag as a time-wasting con job. I was going to give her one \nmore week, just one, but then something came up that I couldn’t ignore. Word \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG014 – Piecemeal \n7 \n \ncame down that Noriega was meeting someone at the docks, some fence by \nthe name of Salesa. The man dealt mainly in stolen art and curios, valuable \nstuff, and was paranoid as hell, which meant Noriega was going to be there \nalone. It might have been a trap, sure, but I’d been sitting on my ass waiting for \nhim to magically drop dead for so long that if there was even a chance it was \non the level, I had to take it. \nTurns out it was true, and went off smoother than I could have hoped for. I \nfound the warehouse a few hours before the meet, and staked out a good \nspot. Then I waited. Salesa turned up first, a big Samoan guy with close-\ncropped hair, flanked by four men in dark suits, who carried a square wooden \ncrate between them. They went into the warehouse, and sure enough five \nminutes later there he is, that snake. He was alone, and seemed to be limping \nslightly. He headed inside through the same door, leaving it unlocked. Perfect. \nThere was no point me going in yet. I wasn’t keen to get my head kicked in by \nSalesa’s goons, so I just watched, my hand gripping the hilt of the combat knife \nI’d bought at an army surplus store I know is happy to sell off-the-books. \nIt was almost an hour later that Salesa and his men left, still carrying that box. \nThey didn’t look happy, but I could have given a damn. As soon as they were \nround the corner I headed inside, as quietly as I could, and there he was, \nleaning up against a pile bricks, smoking. I started to move towards him, but as \nI got near he must have heard me, and turned around. He started to say \nsomething about reconsidering, and lowering the price, when he realised I was \nnot Salesa. Then a look passed over the face of Paul Noriega that I will treasure \nforever. No matter what happens to me, the memory of that look of panicked \nterror will stay with me. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG014 – Piecemeal \n8 \n \nHe turned to run, but whatever was wrong with his leg meant he tripped over \nthe bricks instead. I grabbed him by the collar, my knife already out, and \ndragged him up. I had always been the stronger of the two of us, and he knew \nhe couldn’t fight me. Holding up his hand, he begged me to wait, to listen. I \nnoticed that his hand was missing a couple of fingers, old wounds that had long \nhealed over, though I didn’t remember seeing them before. It didn’t matter; I \ncould hear the blood pumping in my head and nothing was going to stop me \ntaking my revenge. He begged for mercy, as I plunged the knife into him once, \ntwice, three times. Again and again and again I stabbed that backstabber until, \nfinally, I him let him fall. He landed on the floor hard, dead weight, his head \nmaking a thick, cracking sound as it hit the bricks, and blood began to pool on \nthe floor around his body. \nAs the rage started to fade and my breathing returned to normal, I took a \nsecond to look over poor dead Paul Noriega, and saw something seemed to \nhave been knocked loose when his head hit the bricks. Picking it up, I saw it \nwas a glass eye. I looked back at the corpse, and sure enough there was a \ngaping hole where his left eye should have been. When had that happened? \nHe certainly had both eyes when we had worked together and all ten fingers as \nwell. He’d also had all his teeth, where now I saw gaps all over that dead, \nsmiling face. I shivered, though I don’t know why. \nI won’t go into detail about how I went about disposing of the body. Just trust \nme when I say that even if the cops did find any piece of Noriega’s corpse, they \nwouldn’t be able to pin it on me. And life went on. His boys did come looking \nfor me when their boss didn’t return, but I knew to lay low for a while, and \nsoon enough they realised that if he was gone, they weren’", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 4, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 4499}}
