Her name was Alex \nBrooke, and she was a medical student at Corpus Christi. She’d grown up in an \nex-mining town in the Black Country, though I can’t remember which one, and \nshe seemed to feel the same way I did. But where I was anxious and self-\nconscious, she was angry. I never met anyone who could skewer the pompous \ndickheads like she could. I think she actually head-butted some rich kid from \nChrist Church once. \nShe was a couple of years above me, and we met after we both went to some \nself-satisfied theatre thing in my second week. We simultaneously decided to \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG094 – Dead Woman Walking \n4 \n \nditch it halfway through when they started talking about the ‘highlights of the \nlast season at the National’. We went for a drink instead, and just like that we \nwere inseparable. \nAlex was always so confident, so… utterly unafraid. I always admired her for \nthat, even if I sometimes found it almost as intimidating as the posh boys \nquoting Latin. I think she made a point of never letting anything shake her. \nEven when talking about the most morbid subjects, she never lost that smile. \nAnd as a medical student, there were plenty of morbid subjects to talk about. \nShe’d discuss her dissections with me, I think just to watch me squirm a bit, \nand talk about how hungry she always got at the smell of preserved brain. \nApparently, it’s exactly like tinned tuna. She liked to make that observation just \nbefore taking a big bite of her sandwich. I don’t think I actually ever saw her \neat tuna any other time. Maybe she didn’t even like the stuff, she just wanted \nto make a point. \nI’m sure you remember all the protests back then. I went on a few marches \nmyself, so it didn’t exactly come as a huge surprise to hear that there was a \ngroup occupying one of the faculty buildings. What was strange about the \nwhole thing was nobody seemed to exactly know what the group were \nprotesting, or exactly when it had started. They’d taken over part of the \nMedical Sciences building, though, so I think most people assumed it was some \nsort of scientific ethics or animal rights thing. The staff were all very quiet \nabout it. \nAlex was loudly angry about it, as was her way. I wasn’t sure exactly what it \nwas about, but reckoned I was probably on the protestor’s side, or close to it, \nbut she was having none of it. Apparently classes were being changed all over \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG094 – Dead Woman Walking \n5 \n \nthe place to avoid that part of the building, and it was playing havoc with her \nschedule. \nOne night, when we were both through a few pints in Balliol bar, I mentioned \nthat it was a bit weird there weren’t more police around, if they were illegally \noccupying the place, and she got this little light in her eye. This wrinkle round \nthe edges that I knew meant trouble. I asked her what she was planning, but \nshe just shook her head, and gestured to get another drink. \nI didn’t see her again until the following afternoon. She called me up out of \nnowhere and demanded we have lunch. I didn’t point out that it was four. \nThere was something in her voice that made me think she hadn’t slept, and not \nbecause she’d partied the night away. I pushed a plate of chips and sausage \ntowards her, but she barely looked at it. Finally, she looked up at me, and I saw \nsomething new in her face. I saw fear. “They were just… sitting there,” she \nsaid. \nApparently, Alex had found her way back into the Medical Science building \nafter putting me drunkenly to bed. God knows what she was planning to do; I \ndon’t think even she was completely sure. Something about catching the \nprotesters sleeping and bothering them the way she thought they’d been \nbothering her. She’d found her way to the rooms they’d taken over, and was \nabout to go in, when she’d glanced through the small window on the swinging \ndouble doors. \nThey were lying on the floor, she told me. All of them. Not like they were \nsleeping, but like they’d just… collapsed, motionless, where they had been \nstanding. There were no placards, no signs, just a couple dozen normal-looking \nstudents fallen to the floor.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 1, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 4257}}
