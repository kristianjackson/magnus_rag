Already filled almost to bursting, the bag tore open easily. \nFrom the newly ripped hole, poured teeth. Hundreds, thousands of teeth; they \ncame streaming down it a waterfall of white, cream and yellow, bouncing as \nthey hit the pavement, and gradually forming a pile of astounding size. When \nthe bag was finally empty, we just stood there in silence, staring at the \nmountain of teeth that now lay on ground before us. They looked like human \nteeth to me, but I wasn’t exactly an expert and I sure as hell didn’t want to \ncheck closer. Finally, David broke the silence by vomiting loudly into a nearby \ndrain and I backed away from the grisly mound. Even Alan looked shaken by \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG005 – Thrown Away \n7 \n \nthis – I suppose some things are disconcerting however grim your interests. \nWe phoned the police. \nThat’s something else that people always forget about garbage men – we’re \nperfectly capable of calling the police if we see obviously illegal stuff being \nthrown away. Usually we don’t bother if it’s just something small, but this… for \nthis we phoned the police. They came in surprisingly good time and I reckon \nthey were even more freaked out than we were. One of them took our \nstatements, while the other went up to the house itself to check on the \noccupants, and see if they knew anything about the teeth. As the officer \nknocked on the door, we all strained to get a better look at what greeted her. \nThere was no way after all this we were going to pass up a chance to actually \nget a look at the residents of 93 Lancaster Road. Eventually the door opened, \nand an old woman stood there, blinking in the early morning sunlight and \nclearly slightly alarmed to see the police. Needless to say, the old lady and her \nhusband had no idea about any of the weird bags that had been appearing in \ntheir rubbish and seemed properly upset when they were given the details. \nThe police spent a good ten minutes doing their best to collect up all the teeth, \nand we were sent on our way. I have no idea what, if anything, the \ninvestigation turned up. Certainly I was never contacted by them again, and if \nany of the rest were, they didn’t mention it. \nAnd for a while, that was it. We kept an eye out whenever we were heading \ndown Lancaster Road, but didn’t encounter any further ominous garbage bags. \nI thought maybe the involvement of the police had scared off whoever was \nleaving them. Maybe the police had caught the culprit and just hadn’t told us. \nI did start to notice, though, that Alan wasn’t doing well.
