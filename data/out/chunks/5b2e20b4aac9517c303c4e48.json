And as I stared at it, it moved. It started to bend, slowly, and \nI realised I was looking at an arm, along, thin arm. As it bent the joint close to \nwhere the arm ended, I think I saw another joint further down, also moving, \nand bending what I can only assume were elbows; it hooked the end of the \nlimb over through the window. When I say moved, that’s not quite right. It \nshifted. Like when you stare at one of those old magic eye paintings and you \nchange from seeing one picture into seeing another. I never saw anything I \ncould actually call a hand, but still it pulled itself through his window. It took \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG003 – Across The Street \n10 \n \nless than a second, and I didn’t get a good look at what it was, I just saw \nthese… arms, legs? At least four of them, but there might have been more, and \nthey kind of folded themselves through the window in a flash of mottled grey. I \nthink that was the colour – it was mostly a silhouette, and if there was a body \nor head, it shifted inside faster than I could see it. The moment it was inside, \nthe light in Graham’s flat went out, and the window slammed down behind it. \nSo yeah, I just kind of stood there for a long time, trying to process what I’d \njust seen. I could make out some vague movements from inside Graham’s flat, \nbut couldn’t see anything clearly. I finally decided I had to phone the police, \nthough I didn’t have any idea what to tell them. In the end I simply said I’d \nseen someone suspicious climbing in through a fourth floor window at his \naddress and hung up before they could ask me who was calling. Then I waited \nand watched the darkened flat opposite. I couldn’t look away – I was \nconvinced that if I stopped staring that… whatever the hell it was would fold \nitself back out, reach over and step into my home. Nothing came out. \nAbout ten minutes later I saw a police car driving up the street. No sirens, no \nflashing lights, but they were here, and right away I started to feel better. \nLooking up, though, I saw the light had come on in Graham’s flat. There was no \nsign of the thing I’d seen climb in, but as the police pressed the buzzer outside \nhis building, I saw someone walking towards the door to let them in. It wasn’t \nGraham. \nI can’t stress enough how much this was not Graham. He looked completely \ndifferent. He was maybe a few inches shorter and had a long, square face \ntopped with curly blond hair, where Graham’s had been dark and cut short. He \nwas dressed in Graham’s clothes, though; I recognised the shirt from my \nmonths of watching, but he was not Graham.
