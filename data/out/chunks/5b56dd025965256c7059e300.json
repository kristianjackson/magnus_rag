The Magnus Archives. Episode one hundred and eighty-\nsix: \"Quiet.\" \n[Theme finishes] \n[Tape clicks on] \n[A light rain falls; in the distance a rolling thunderstorm that never \ncomes closer] \n[Footsteps on a muddy outdoors track that come to a halt] \n(Martin sighs) \nMARTIN \nSo this is it, then. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 186 – Quiet \n \n2 \n…How dreary. \n[Walking resumes] \nMARTIN (CONT’D) \n(Calling) Hello!? Anybody!? \nJohn? \nHello! \n(Beat) \n[Walking stops] \nMARTIN (CONT’D) \nBig surprise. \nWell at least I can still remember everything this time. And no more bloody \nchairs. \nIt’s weird, though. Never actually been anywhere like this. That said, it is kind \nof… huh… \n[A static with faint squeals starts] \n[There is reverse reverb on Also Martin’s first words as he appears; \nhis tone is tinged with sadness throughout] \nALSO MARTIN \nWuthering Heights. \nMARTIN \nYeah. God, I hated studying that. It was all just so… \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 186 – Quiet \n \n3 \nALSO MARTIN \nOverblown. \nMARTIN \nYeah... \nALSO MARTIN \nBut that cover... those wide empty spaces. It felt right, didn’t it? \n[Static ends] \nMARTIN \nSo what? That’s where we are? \nALSO MARTIN \nRight down to the monochrome. \nMARTIN \nHm. \nD’you have an umbrella? \nALSO MARTIN \nNo. \nBut you don’t want one. We like the rain. \nMARTIN \nTrue. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 186 – Quiet \n \n4 \nALSO MARTIN \nBecause it makes the sadness feel at home. It turns it from a burden into– \nMARTIN \n(Sigh) –an indulgence. \nALSO MARTIN \nThat’s right. \n[They start walking] \nMARTIN \nSo what is this? You’re part of me so you know everything about me? Is that it? \nALSO MARTIN \nYes. \nMARTIN \nBecause you’re part of my domain? \nALSO MARTIN \nAlso yes. \nMARTIN \nSome sort of cosmic joke about ‘being alone with my thoughts’ I assume? \nALSO MARTIN \nI’m here because you’re trying very hard not to be alone. To resist the comfort. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 186 – Quiet \n \n5 \nMARTIN \nSo, instead I get to talk to myself? \nALSO MARTIN \nApparently. \n[Walking continues until they reach a place to sit on the ground] \n(Both Martins sigh as they sit down) \nMARTIN \nOkay, so if I’m so desperate not to be alone, why isn’t John here? Hmm? He \ncan find me anywhere. \nALSO MARTIN \nI don’t know. \nMARTIN \n(Dubious) Oh yeah? \nALSO MARTIN \nLook, I know what you know. Maybe I’m just a bit more... open about it. \nMARTIN \nAnd what do you mean by that? \nALSO MARTIN \nLike how you don’t actually want him here? Maybe that has something to do \nwith it? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 186 – Quiet \n \n6 \nMARTIN \nYou’ve no idea what you’re talking about! \nALSO MARTIN \nI mean, you can argue with me if you like. Seems like a bit of a waste though. \nMARTIN \nI— No, a— \nALSO MARTIN \nIt’s alright. It’s hard to be vulnerable. \nMARTIN \n(Resigned) No its— It’s not that. \nALSO MARTIN \nNo? \nMARTIN \nNo, I just… I’m ashamed to let him see this place, alright. To see what— I don’t \nknow, what feeds me? \nALSO MARTIN \nSure, that’s part of it, but… it’s not the whole thing, is it? Not really. \nMARTIN \nWhat do you mean? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 186 – Quiet \n \n7 \nALSO MARTIN \nWell, if you don’t count ‘memory manor’, when was the last time you were \neven on your own? \nMARTIN \nWell I… hmm. \nALSO MARTIN \nIt has been a very long time since the Institute. \nMARTIN \nThat’s… a good point. \nALSO MARTIN \nIt’s okay to want a bit of space now and then. New romance is hard. And \nArmageddon makes it even harder, never mind the fact that you’re \nmetaphorically joined at the hip thanks to the whole ‘eye-lord’ thing. It’s okay \nto want some space. \nMARTIN \n(Suspicious) Ohhhhh, I see. \nALSO MARTIN \nSee what? \nMARTIN \nI get it. So that’s your deal. You tell me what I want to hear to try and get me to \nstay.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 0, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 4150}}
