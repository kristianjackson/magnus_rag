It was here long before any might have thought \nof it as a home. \nOnce, there was a patch of land, not quite as firm in this reality as that which \nsurrounded it. \nStop, no. \nIt’s not about the land. Mud and soil has no part in what is there. \nOnce, there was a point in space that did not quite obey all those petty rules \nthat decide what can be allowed to happen in a world. \nStop, no. \nIt’s not a point in space. The Earth spins and hurtles through the darkness, but \nit still carries it along. \nLet us simply say that once there was a place. A place where the universe had… \ncracked. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 196 – This Old House \n \n11 \nNone of us remember what had caused the crack, not even those things \nbeyond time who might measure a generation in the echoes of their screams. \nIt had been there as long as they have, if not longer. It’s not a large crack, and \nto walk by it, even through it, you’d never pause to notice. Perhaps the air \naround it is slightly thinner, lights slightly dimmer... In the Summer there may \nbe the slightest chill. In the Winter a warmth that is almost unsettling. The \nfungus that grows in the damp there is somehow more vibrant in its whiteness, \nwhile flowers remain duller than those that neighbour them. But these \nchanges are slight, and none have dwelt on them long enough to call the place \ncursed. Indeed, few have ever thought much of it at all. Perhaps there are \nmany such places across the Earth. Perhaps it is unique. Certainly, no-one has \nknown either way. \nThe first to build a home upon that spot was named Eowa. He was a Saxon, \nand a coward, who had fled the field against the Mercian king, and sought to \nfind his peace there. His squalid little hut was far removed from those of his \nonce-kinsmen. Nonetheless, there he lived and worked, and tried hopelessly to \nforget the stench of blood and rot, and the feel of a seax knife in the wound he \ncarried to the end of his life. Did his terror call to him with the drumbeat voice \nof carnage? Did it sing to him with the squirming melody of decay? Could any \nhave told you the difference? \nIt is strange. That a name, a face, a taste of fear should linger through the \ncenturies, and yet I cannot be sure which of them it was that ate so well. Some \nfears are eternal, but within them lie a hundred titles, whispered in the secret \nplaces of every era of every corner of our world. Who can say if any of them \nare true? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 196 – This Old House \n \n12 \nWhichever it might have been, they knew Eowa’s terrors well. Until he was no \nlonger there. Until he awoke in a place that was a place but... somewhere else. \nSomewhere the Mercians had pushed further, had taken more. For all his \ndread of a violent death, his end was quick and clean. And none of his kinsmen \never knew his fate. His hut, left unattended, quickly fell to disrepair, then to \ncollapse. No-one used the wood; the grain was warped. \nMany lived in that spot across the following years. Some in peace, some in \nmisery, a few in strangled fear. But none tied their sorrows to the land or the \ndwelling they might have erected upon it. The village slowly grew and became \na more populous town though not ever a remarkable one. That said, perhaps, \nsometimes, in the quiet, those who tried to make it their home might have felt \na whisper, an echo of some other place, some place not quite their own. But it \nnever disturbed their sleep. \n[Wood creaks from the building] \nMARTIN (CONT’D) \nSo what does it mean, for a place to be haunted? A place can be haunted by \nsomeone, some poor soul whose bones lie restless in the shallow soil. It can be \nhaunted by something, some crime or atrocity that indelibly marked itself \nupon the soul of a spot. But can it be haunted by somewhere? An echo of \nworlds that are not our own, alien pasts that draw to unknown presents, \nleaking through the smallest, narrowest crack at the very edge of existence? \nThe closest anyone ever came to knowing was a man named Geoffrey Neckam, \na scholar from the University. He bought the house that then sat there from a \nbow-legged milliner whose name he never bothered to learn, seeking some \npeace and removal from his more raucous colleagues.
