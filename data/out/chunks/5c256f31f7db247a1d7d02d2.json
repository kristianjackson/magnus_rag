It was the old crew – me, \nDavid Atayah, Matthew Wilkinson, and Alan Parfitt, who drives - drove - the \ntruck. \nWhat it did do, though, was mark out 93 Lancaster Road in our minds as “the \nDoll House”, since we spent the rest of the day making off-colour jokes about \nthe sort of people who must live there. I said before that your bin man knows a \nlot about you. Now that’s probably not actually true for most people – we \nservice hundreds of homes each day and who can keep track of that many \npeople? Who wants to? You do have houses, though, that you learn to keep an \neye on; the sort of places that throw out strange or sometimes even dangerous \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG005 – Thrown Away \n4 \n \nthings. Like I said, we probably know if you’re an alcoholic, but it’s not because \nwe watch you obsessively or care about your health. It’s because smashed \nbottles and broken glass are dangerous and you learn to keep an eye out \naround houses where you’re likely to find them. I read once that waste \ncollection is the second most dangerous profession in England. Not sure I \nbelieve it - they said the first was farming - but you do see your fair share of \ninjuries, so you learn to keep your eyes peeled and mark out in your mind \nwhich houses you want to stay wary of. Now after that the Doll House became \none of those houses for our crew. Not so much for any known danger, but \nwhen someone throws out a bin full of weird stuff like that, you never know \nwhat else they might decide to toss. Also, Alan, well, he had kind of a twisted \nsense of humour, and he loved the doll heads. When we told him he insisted \non stopping the truck and getting out to have a look, so after that he always \nmade a point to ask us to keep an eye on 93. And we did. The next couple of \nweeks, when we pulled up to 93, I took an extra second or two just to check for \nanything strange in the bins, but nothing seemed out of the ordinary. Alan \nespecially was disappointed by this but it was hardly something to dwell on, so \nwe put is out of our minds and pressed on with the day’s work. This continued \nfor what must have been a few months and the whole doll heads incident \nhadn’t come up, except for a few interesting conversations at the recycling \nplant where, to be honest, I don’t think anyone believed us, or if they did \nthey’d immediately try to top it with their own story of bizarre finds. \nIt was the start of spring when we got the next strange bag from 93 Lancaster \nRoad. Again, it was an unmarked black refuse bag placed next to the recycling \nbin. As soon as I saw it, I knew it was another one. The shape of it was too \nregular to be full of the normal assortment of rubbish. As I picked it up, I \nrealised it was far too light as well.
