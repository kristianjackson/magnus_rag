There is no mistaking who it is that lies within that \nsoftly padded box. Beneath your threadbare suit and fear-stained shirt, the \nscars that lattice across your body ache and burn at the sight of the one who \ngave them to you. You feel the cross she once carved into your back open, and \nbegin to weep its own bloody testament. \nYou need to leave, to turn and flee and find the end to this necropolis of polite \ndenials and vicious civility. Your vision swims as you turn from the face of \ndeath, and find your arm grasped by the Funeral Director. His hand moves and \nyou move with it, unable to stand against the unyielding strength of his \nsimplest gesture. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 180 – Moving On \n16 \n[Footsteps to the podium] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nHe places you behind the podium, as the mourners stare at you, and you \nrealise with a stab of agonised dread that they are waiting for your eulogy, \ntheir faces alight with hungry grief. \n‘If you would like to say a few words...,’ the Director commands. \nYou want to scream at them, curse them all for hypocrites. How can they not \nsmell the blood she spilled? The path of scars and pain she left behind her \nevery minute of her life? She was a monster, brutal and unrepentant. \n‘She was...,’ you begin, a heavy pause before your voice betrays you. ‘The most \nkind and loving person I ever had the wonderful fortune to meet. Each life she \ntouched was left brighter and more beautiful for her presence. She was... an \nangel.’ \nThe tears are flowing freely now, as your eulogy continues. You cannot turn \nfrom the podium, cannot stop the gushing flow of love and forgiveness you \nvomit out into the nodding crowd. Behind you, a dark shadow moves, a shape \nthat seems to slither from the coffin. \n[Wood creaks, shuffling footsteps, and undead vocalisations] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nYou watch it coming closer from the corner of your eye, but you cannot stop \nyour kind words. Not even as the needle-sharp teeth of her corpse begin to dig \ninto your shoulder. \n[The sound of flesh tearing] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 180 – Moving On \n17 \n[Hissing static starts] \n[Sounds of the necropolis return] \n[Hissing static ends] \n(Archivist exhales) \nARCHIVIST \n(Quietly excited) Right, then. I’m done. Let’s see what we’ve got. \n[Tape clicks off] \n[Tape clicks on] \n[A wasteland wind swirls with the sound of distant distorted howls] \n[Footsteps that shortly come to a halt] \nMARTIN \nIs that... \nARCHIVIST \n(Pleased) Looks like it. \nMARTIN \n(Crosstalk) No, no… \nARCHIVIST \n(Crosstalk) Yes. \nMARTIN \nIt… can’t be real? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 180 – Moving On \n18 \n[In the distance, a peacock calls, and birds common to England sing] \nARCHIVIST \nAnd yet! \nMARTIN \nBut, but it’s... it’s… \nARCHIVIST \nYeah! \nMARTIN \nIt-It’s like something out of a National Trust brochure. \nARCHIVIST \nI mean I’m pretty sure it is National Trust. Was, anyway. \nMARTIN \nBut, you don’t know for sure? \nARCHIVIST \nNo. I can’t see anything about it. If I had to guess... Upton House, maybe? I \nmean, country houses and stately homes not exactly my specialist subjects. \nMARTIN \nBut it’s… it’s fine. It’s better than fine. T-There are trees. Look! Like, real trees! \nARCHIVIST \nIt’s beautiful. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 180 – Moving On \n19 \nMARTIN \nIt’s a trap. \nARCHIVIST \n(Still delighted) No! It might be a trap. We-we just don’t know! \nMARTIN \nJohn... \n(Beat) \nARCHIVIST \n(Resigned) Yeah, we’ll go around. \n[Birds and peacock continue to call] \n[The Archivist goes to move off] \nMARTIN \nNo... (sigh) No, no, no. Let’s, let’s check it out. I mean, obviously it can’t be \nhow it seems but… well… \nARCHIVIST \nWhat if it is? \nMARTIN \nHuh, exactly. \nARCHIVIST \nA beautiful oasis, untouched by the end of the world. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 180 – Moving On \n20 \nMARTIN \nIt’s got to be worth a shot, right? \nARCHIVIST \nThank you. \nMARTIN \nDon’t fret it. It’s just nice to see you like this. \n[Tape clicks off] \n[Tape clicks on] \n[Bird song, much closer and clearer] \n[The distant sound of music] \nMARTIN \nSo what now? I don’t see a doorbell. \nARCHIVIST \nI’m not even sure this door actually opens. \nMARTIN \nBut it should, it’s the front door! Besides, it’s the biggest one so if it’s not— \nARCHIVIST \nI mean maybe they expect you to come in through the café or, I mean, they \nusually have a little gift shop or something.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 4, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 4385}}
