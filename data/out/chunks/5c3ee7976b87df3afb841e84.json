The \ngovernment had commissioned the construction of Close Supervision Centres \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG052 – Exceptional Risk \n11 \n \nin prisons all over the country and Wakefield was one of the flagship initiatives. \nA good portion of F wing was given over to our own CSC, soon to be known as \nthe Exceptional Risk Unit. It could only hold eight prisoners, but they were to \nbe the worst of the worst, kept under constant scrutiny and given no chance to \nharm anyone. I was picked to be one of the officers transferred into the new \nunit. I don’t know if it was specifically because I had more inmate altercations \non my record than any other prison officer at Wakefield, but given the \nintensity of the set-up, I’m sure it didn’t hurt my application. \nRobert Montauk was an obvious choice for the Exceptional Risk Unit. During \nhis time in Wakefield, he had been involved in several further violent incidents \nand, though he hadn’t yet killed anyone inside the prison, the higher-ups \nreckoned it was only a matter of time. So, in he went. The CSC was not a nice \nplace. Wakefield had had the budget to make it secure, but not to make it \nanything less than starkly utilitarian. The individual cells were cramped and \nclaustrophobic, with almost no natural light filtering in from the outside. Oh, \nthey still got their exercise, but it was in bare, metal cages. We kept them \nseparated from each other almost as much as we kept them from the rest of \nthe prison. You must never underestimate how violent and desperate a \ntrapped animal can become. \nWe were cruel to them. I am not ashamed of that. If I were to tell you all the \ncrimes of those monsters we kept in the ERU, you’d probably lose your lunch \nbefore I was halfway through the list. Keeping them beat down was the only \nway to make sure they behaved. And besides, atonement is important. \nI’ll admit though, I always had a soft spot for Robert Montauk. He never gave \nus any trouble. Away from the other prisoners, he seemed docile, almost eerily \nso sometimes. Also, and it’s a small thing, but he never denied his crimes.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 3, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 2710}}
