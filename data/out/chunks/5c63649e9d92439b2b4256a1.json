And to be fair, I was surprised by some of the details. \nBut as soon as I saw the spot, I just knew that someone else was up there and \nthat they were dead. The only questions were how and who. I think I’d given \nup on why. \nI didn’t know them, as it turned out. A young woman, conservatively dressed – \nher face was bloody, but I was sure I didn’t recognise her. She had a bag with \nher, and her ID read ‘Yetunde Uthman’ – not a name I’d ever encountered \nbefore. Just another victim of this place. It looked as though she had forced her \nhead through the mirror on the dressing table, the shards cutting her face and \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 150 – Cul-de-Sac \n \n9 \n \nneck to ribbons, a particularly large piece piercing her jugular, spilling blood all \ndown the unremarkable white table and onto the light brown carpet below. I \ndon’t think she’d been dead that long, but I’m not a doctor and I didn’t really \ntry to check. \nInstead, I turned and ran, all my tiredness gone in a sudden rush of adrenaline, \ndown the stairs, out the door and into the night and the rows upon rows of \nbland, empty houses. And then, all at once, I wasn’t running anymore. I was \nlying on the ground, collapsed, the tarmac rough and cool against my cheek, \nwet from my tears. I was going to die – I knew that now – just as she had, just \nas anyone else who came here had. How many corpses lay waiting behind the \nplacid facade of this endless false suburbia? \nAnd that was when I heard it. It was quiet, and my mind took a few moments \nto accept it could be real, but sure enough, there it was: the sound of my \nphone’s ringtone. I looked up, and not three doors down was my car, the door \nstill open where I had left it. I stumbled over, my legs still weak, and grabbed \nthe handset, which should have been long out of battery, and I stared at the \nglowing screen. It was Alberto. He was calling me; I don’t know how. But the \ntears came even faster now, as I answered, sobbing with relief to hear him \nyelling at me for taking so long. Had I forgotten? Was I even planning to \nbother? I tried to reply, to explain, but all I could manage to say, to get through \nthe shaking sobs, was, “I love you.” He went very quiet, and then he hung up. It \ndidn’t matter, though, because when I looked around, the windows of the \nhouses were lit, and a woman was coming down from her front door to ask if I \nneeded help with my car. \nWe’re working on it, the two of us. We’re not exactly back together yet, but I \nthink it’s going well. He’s reluctant to sell the house, but I’ve made it quite \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 150 – Cul-de-Sac \n \n10 \n \nclear that I’m never going back to the suburbs, even if I can’t really tell him \nwhy. I checked to see if I could find anything about Yetunde Uthman, and I did \nfind a few old social media profiles, but I wasn’t able to get through to any \nfamily or friends. As far as I can tell, she disappeared a year ago. And nobody \nnoticed. \nARCHIVIST \nStatement ends. \nThe Lonely is possibly the most insidious of the powers, I believe. Certainly, it is \nthe one that most delights in having you do its work for it. Even the spiders \nseem to have a hard time matching it for sheer seductiveness. Time to \nyourself, self-care, putting yourself first, not being a burden on those you care \nabout. It doesn’t even need to tell you any lies. It just waits for the lies you tell \nyourself. \nWe’re all well aware that, with Peter Lukas in charge of the Institute, it’s a very \nreal danger to all of us. We are trying. Daisy, Basira and I, we don’t leave the \nInstitute much anymore, so we do spend a lot of time together. It’s not that \neasy though. When everyone has so many walls, so many defences, sometimes \nyou can feel lonely even when you’re all in the same room. But it’s better than \nthe alternative, and at least none of us are suffering alone. Martin’s got it the \nworst of course, but it still seems to be his choice, and I have to trust that he \nknows what he’s doing. \nStill feeling week. Restless. I want to be proactive, but that hasn’t … (Sighs) \nThat hasn’t been going quite so well for us lately. \nOh, uh…", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 5, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 4256}}
