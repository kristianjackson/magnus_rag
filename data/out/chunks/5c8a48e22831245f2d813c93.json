I have supplies for a good few years, and \nthen I plan to take my own life. I think perhaps that’s the greatest blessing the \ncamera can bestow. I. Can. Die. Here. Escape this place. Not yet, of course, and \nmaybe the wine will do me in before I have to take matters into my own \nhands, but still, it remains a comfort. \nAnyway, no more stories, I think. Let us relax, and talk and drink. And not \nworry about who might be… listening. \n[Tape clicks off] \n[Tape clicks on] \n[Bag-packing noises inside an otherwise quiet room] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 181 – Ignorance \n20 \nMARTIN \nYou’re sure we can’t stay longer? \nARCHIVIST \nYes. I-I-I’ve been...um… Er, these last few days I-I’ve been getting weaker. Dizzy \nspells, vagueness. You’ve seen it. \nBeing cut off from the Eye... It’s not good for me. \nMARTIN \nYeah, but if, if you’re that connected, that dependent, what happens if we \nactually, y’know, do manage to— \nARCHIVIST \nWe’ll cross that bridge when we come to it. For now, I just need us to be \nmoving on. \nMARTIN \nMm. \n[Footsteps, and a door creak] \nANNABELLE \nAll packed? \nARCHIVIST \nMm. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 181 – Ignorance \n21 \nMARTIN \nOh! Finally showing your face? \nANNABELLE \nI’m sure I don’t know what you mean. \nMARTIN \nPffft. All week you scuttle around with… with food and drinks and all that other \nstuff, whatever we need and just when we need it, but if we actually try to talk \nto you, you’re gone. \nANNABELLE \n(Smilingly) I’m very busy. \nARCHIVIST \nMartin, don’t bother; we’re-we’re not going to get any answers out of her. \nMARTIN \nY-You’re joking right? She’s been lurking at the edges of this whole thing since \nthe beginning, and now we can finally actually talk to her, and, what, you’re \njust going to pass? You don’t have any questions? Nothing at all? \n…John? John! \n[Martin clicks his fingers in front of the Archivist] \nARCHIVIST \n(Distant) Wha… Oh, yes… sorry. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 181 – Ignorance \n22 \nLook, it’s no accident we finally meet face-to-face in the one place I-I can’t get \nany answers out of her. \nANNABELLE \n(Smug) I’m sure I don’t know what you mean. \nMARTIN \nWhy are you here? Hmmm? What’s your game? \nANNABELLE \nPerhaps I just value my privacy. \nMARTIN \nFine, fine. Why did you call me before? \nANNABELLE \nPerhaps I thought you could use a friendly voice? \nMARTIN \nFriendly!? You told me John didn’t need me! \nANNABELLE \nObjectively true. And more importantly, perhaps I thought that you might need \na little bit of righteous indignation to help you power through the next steps. \nMARTIN \nI don’t like being manipulated. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 181 – Ignorance \n23 \nANNABELLE \nThen we probably aren’t going to be friends. \n(Sound of frustrated Martin) \nFor what it’s worth, I’m sorry. The call was... clumsy. There are so many things \nto keep track of at the moment. I must confess it did lack my usual... nuance. \nARCHIVIST \nAnd perhaps you’re now just trying to humanise yourself so we underestimate \nyour next move. \nANNABELLE \nPerhaps. \n(Beat) \nMARTIN \nSo…So that’s it, then? We-We’re just going to leave her here? \nARCHIVIST \nYes. \nMARTIN \nWe could make her tell us. \nARCHIVIST \nNo, we couldn’t. I don’t have my powers, and if it came to a physical fight I \nreally don’t rate our chances. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 181 – Ignorance \n24 \nMARTIN \nHey, I can handle myself! \nANNABELLE \nBut can you handle me? \n(Beat) \nMARTIN \nI don’t like you. \nANNABELLE \nI know. \nMARTIN \nGod… F-Fine. Fine! \n[Backpack is grabbed] \nMARTIN (CONT’D) \nCome on, John. \nARCHIVIST \n(Vague) Oh… I‘m sorry, what? \nMARTIN \nWe’re leaving. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 181 – Ignorance \n25 \nANNABELLE \nDon’t worry, Martin. We’ll meet again. Hopefully when you’re feeling a little \nbit more… open-minded. \nMARTIN \nI wouldn’t count on it. \nANNABELLE \nI would. \n(Martin exasperated sigh) \nARCHIVIST \n(Vague) That’s the trouble with old houses, I suppose. Full of spiders. \nANNABELLE \nYou boys better take care of yourselves. I’m sure we’ll see each other again \nvery soon. Here, why don’t I show you out. \nARCHIVIST \nFine. \n[Footsteps proceed through the hallways and doors of the country \nhouse] \n[A door creaks open, followed by faint sounds of opera] \nMIKAELE \nAh, you are off, then?", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 5, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 4404}}
