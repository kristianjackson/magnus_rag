The jailors have that effect. \nShall we go? \nMARTIN \nWhat if another one comes along? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 185 – Locked In \n \n11 \nARCHIVIST \nIt’s fine. We’re, uh, we’re ‘guests of the Warden’. \nMARTIN \nEurgh. \nARCHIVIST \nMm-hmm. Come on. \n[The metal door creaks as they walk out, continuing down a \ncorridor] \n(Beat) \nMARTIN \nDoes it not bother you? \nARCHIVIST \nWhat? Being a ‘guest’? \nMARTIN \nYeah. I-It’s-It’s not like it resisted. Hell, it was chummy. \nARCHIVIST \nWould you rather it had attacked? \nMARTIN \nNo it’s just... Is that how these creatures see us now? As one of them? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 185 – Locked In \n \n12 \nARCHIVIST \n(Amused) Hm! I forgot that’s a new experience for you. \nMARTIN \nExcuse me? \nARCHIVIST \nYou have to remember I’ve had this for years. Right from the start, it’s always \nbeen ‘Archivist’ this and ‘Archivist’ that. All these weird, awful creatures \nassuming I’m ‘in’ on all the secrets. Even when they were trying to kill me, they \ntreated me like I was a... a peer. \nMARTIN \nYeah, but they were still trying to kill you. \nARCHIVIST \nNot all of them. And now? Sure the power’s shifted, it’s all politeness and \nrespect, but it still feels just like more of the same. I guess I just stopped caring \nat some point. Besides they are technically right, I am one of them. To a \ndegree. \nMARTIN \nI suppose. \nARCHIVIST \nI think the real question is how are you finding it? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 185 – Locked In \n \n13 \nMARTIN \nIt’s not the same. I’m still just your ‘plus one’. \nARCHIVIST \n(Amusedly) Don’t put yourself down. It’s not your fault you’re a bit \novershadowed. I am such a very big deal after all. \nMARTIN \nOh, very big arse, more like it. \n(The Archivist chuckles) \nARCHIVIST \nEither way, even if I wasn’t here, I don’t think you’d be in any danger. Not \nanymore. I wasn’t sure when we first started out, I hadn’t properly, er… looked \ninto it, as it were. But now I’m certain. \n(Beat) \nMARTIN \nI’m one of them. \nARCHIVIST \nOne of… us. \nMARTIN \n(Sighs) That’s not as comforting as you think it is. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 185 – Locked In \n \n14 \nARCHIVIST \nDoesn’t mean it’s not true though. \n[A nearby prisoner cries] \nMARTIN \nAnd this is all because I’ve been given a domain? Because apparently I \nsomehow have people’s fear feeding me? \nARCHIVIST \nWell, feeding The Eye through you, but yes. \nMARTIN \nEven though I didn’t ask for it? Did nothing to deserve it? \nARCHIVIST \n‘Deserve’. Huh. Now there’s a word that always causes trouble. \nMARTIN \nDon’t be patronising. \nARCHIVIST \nI just mean that nobody here deserves the position they’ve found themselves \nin, not really. I suppose a few may have asked for it, sought it out even, but far \nmore didn’t. They just made the wrong choices for the right reasons. Or even \nthe right choices. But ones that still led them here in the end. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 185 – Locked In \n \n15 \nMARTIN \n…I hate it. \nARCHIVIST \nOn balance that’s probably a good thing. \n[A couple of quick footsteps and sudden rattling against metal bars] \nINSPECTOR \nHey! Hey, you! Yeah, I know you! \n[The Archivist and Martin stop walking] \nMARTIN \nUh... \nINSPECTOR \nIt’s.. f-f-from the, uh, Magnus Institute! Um… ah... Mark! \nARCHIVIST \nYou know him? \nMARTIN \nMartin. \nINSPECTOR \nMartin, right, yeah! You remember? You tipped us off, and we came and \nnicked your boss, the, the Bouchard bloke. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 185 – Locked In \n \n16 \nMARTIN \nOh! Oh right! The, um... oh, Inspector... I-I’m so sorry, I’ve forgotten your \nname. \nINSPECTOR \nEh-So have I. Eh-I’m just 547 in here. \nMARTIN \nGod, I’m so sorry. \nINSPECTOR \nYou’ve gotta help me! \nMARTIN \nOh. I— er… I don’t, ah— \nINSPECTOR \nI heard you! You said you were chummy with the Warden. And I need to get \nout, I-I can’t— This place— You’ve got to help me! \nARCHIVIST \nMartin? What do you think? \nMARTIN \nWhat? \nARCHIVIST \nI decided about Jordan. This place is from your past.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 4, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 4040}}
