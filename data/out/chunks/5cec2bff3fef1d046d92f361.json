I was about to get out my phone and call the woman \nwho hired me, when his hand shot out without warning and grabbed me by \nthe throat. He lifted me off my feet with a strength that terrified me, and I was \nvery glad that, even with the hood down, my protective suit kept my neck \ncovered. I could feel his hand through the thick plastic; it was hot, like he was \nrunning some incredibly high fever, and I started to panic. \nHe held me there, almost a foot off the ground, and my vision began to swim \nas he squeezed my throat. As I struggled for breath, I flailed for something to \nfight him off with and realised that I was still holding my lighter. With a degree \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 055 – Pest Control \n \n10 \n \nof composure that, looking back on it now, still surprises me, I flicked the \nlighter on and raised it to just below his arm. \nThe result was a lot more dramatic than I expected. His loose, brown suit \nsleeve caught almost immediately, and within a few moments, his whole arm \nwas alight. He yelped and dropped me onto the ground as he began to flail \nabout, trying to stop the fire spreading further across his body. I staggered to \nmy van. By then, it didn’t matter who the rightful owner of that house was; I \nwas done with that job. It was as I was climbing into the van that I smelled it. \nIt is the most disgusting thing I have ever encountered, halfway between sun-\ncooked roadkill, stale sweat and rotten eggs, with just a hint of burning rubber. \nAnd underneath it all is that undefinable scent of sickness. You know that smell \nyou get when you enter a room where someone’s been ill for several days? No \nmatter what else it smells like, beneath it all there’s that vague but undeniable \nwhiff of disease. That’s what this man smelled like, as he desperately tried to \nextinguish his burning flesh. \nI drove away, trying not to gag, and I didn’t look back. I didn’t call the police \neither, as I felt they might not look too kindly on me setting a man alight, even \nif he did attack me. I assume he didn’t file a report either, as no one ever \nturned up to question me about it. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 055 – Pest Control \n \n11 \n \nSo that was the first time I encountered that smell. \nARCHIVIST \nI see. And the other time was when you burned Jane Prentiss. \nJORDAN \nNot just. I mean, I didn’t actually see her. The incineration was the first time I \never saw her in person. But a couple of years ago, I was called in to deal with a \nwasps’ nest. That is what the landlord had called it on the phone, at least. \nApparently, it had injured one of his tenants earlier that day and I was the first \npet control service he had called that was free immediately. He didn’t tell me \nthe name of the tenant, though obviously I now know who it was. He didn’t \ngive me any real details on the phone, but he seemed happy to pay the \nemergency call-out charge, so I bundled up my wasp gear and headed out to \nProspero Road. \nIt was a bit strange to get a call about wasps at that time of year. It was late \nFebruary or early March, I think, and still quite cold. Still, if it was a warm \nenough building, they could easily be getting active. Regardless, I made sure to \ncheck over the thick suit I used for that sort of job, to make sure there was no \nweakness or damage. If they were aggressive enough to injure someone, I \nwasn’t going to take any chances.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 3, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 3422}}
