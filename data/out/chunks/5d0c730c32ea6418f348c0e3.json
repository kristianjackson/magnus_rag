It’s not like you’ll even be \nable to help me, I just... My mate Hester said he came to you a few years back, \nbeen seeing ghosts and that, and you guys looked into it and told him it was \nsome sort of noise messing with his head, ‘infasound’ or something, and he’s \nfine now. I need that. I need you to tell me that it’s just coincidence and my \nmind’s playing tricks, and I need to not lose any more bits of me. \nSo yeah, I killed that asshole Noriega. Stabbed him in the throat and left him to \nbleed out on the dockside. Maybe that shocks you a bit, maybe not, but trust \nme when I say he had it coming. Eight years we worked together, and it was \nhim that got carried away kicking McMullen’s head in and moved it from \nassault to GBH, but sure enough when we get picked up he turns on me and I \nget pinned for it. Five years I served because of him, while he walked free as \nyou please. I’d say that I was due a bit of payback and I certainly got it \nIt wasn’t my first choice, though. I’m not stupid and parole keeps you on a \nshort enough chain that slitting Noriega’s throat was not my top priority. Don’t \nget me wrong, it was something I’d been itching to do for five goddamn years, \nbut I wasn’t in a rush. I had plenty of time to arrange something nasty for him, \nand I wanted him hurt more than I felt I had to do the deed myself. So when I \ngot out in June last year, I bided my time and kept my ear to the ground. Tried \nto get in touch with him, but was told by the few friends we had in common \nthat he wasn’t interested in talking to me. He’d clearly done ok for himself in \nthe years I’d been away, and could afford some muscle to make sure that I \ndidn’t bother him. I ended up with a couple of bruised ribs when I finally got", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 0, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 2989}}
