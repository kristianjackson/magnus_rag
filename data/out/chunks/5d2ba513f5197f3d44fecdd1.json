It could just leave and-and attack; there was nothing I could do to stop \nit. I just watched it eat all the food. \nNot enough food, apparently, since after a few days of this, it decided to \nsupplement its diet with poor Toby. I’d looked after Toby since he was born. I’d \nhelped birth him. He was my friend. So when I saw what was left of him lying in \nthe pigpen on that damp Tuesday morning, I’m not ashamed to say that I cried. \nHe was the first of my pigs to go, but I was sure he wouldn’t be the last. I tried \nto get the other pigs out a couple of times, move them to another pen, but the \nmonster would start to shift its weight towards me with alarming speed, and I \n\nwould always run away like a coward. The only time I seemed to be safe was \nwhen I was bringing food. \nThis went on for months. My brother, Kurt, came for a visit at one point. He \nsaid he planned to stay a couple of weeks, but the very first night I was woken \nup by the sound of movement outside of the farmhouse. I grabbed a torch, \npopped on my boots, and headed outside. I didn’t even consider not checking \nthe pigsty first. Sure enough, as I got close, I heard something, though it wasn’t \nentirely clear what it was. It wasn’t the sound of a colossal pig eating my \nbrother though, so that was encouraging. It was him, though, stood there, \nstaring into the darkness. He was muttering something to himself. I think the \nwords were, “Long pig. Short pig. Wide pig. Narrow pig.” Over and over. “Long \npig. Short pig. Wide pig. Narrow pig.” He didn’t seem to be entirely conscious, \nso I was reluctant to wake him. I didn’t think it was a nice situation to become \naware of all of a sudden. That said, when he reached over and started fumbling \nwith the latch, I quickly changed my mind, and shook him awake. His eyes \nsnapped open properly and immediately focused on something behind me, in \nthe sty. I didn’t need to look around or ask him what he was looking at. His \npale, stricken face told me plain enough what it was. \nTo his credit, he managed to stay another three days before he had to return \nto London on a ‘business emergency’. For context, I’m pretty sure he works as \na traffic warden. And still the pig just sat there. Waiting. \nI believe it was the circus that got your attention though, wasn’t it? That’s \nwhat you were asking about when you turned up. So, the Carley Brothers \nCircus mostly tours around Australia, but every couple of years they do a New \nZealand tour as well. They do a few other spots around the Pacific, but the \nimportant point for this story is that this is one of the years they’re doing New \n\nZealand. Now, generally they need anywhere between a couple of weeks and a \nmonth of moving things over, setting up, and getting all the right permissions \nand arrangements in place before the tour begins in earnest. I went to school \nwith the brother of the guy who runs it, so the last couple of years they’ve \ndone this, I rented out one of my larger, unused fields to them for their staging \narea. It’s pretty easy money, and they don’t need to use my facilities, and tend \nto be almost entirely self-contained. The first year they did it there was a lot \ntrash left behind we had had to clean up, but apparently someone bashed the \nright heads about it, since last year there was barely a cigarette stub left. \nSo the arrangements are all made, and the Carley Brothers Circus moves onto \none of my fields for a month. I get drunk with the ringmaster and a couple of \nacrobats. So far, so normal. I almost forgot about the monster that lived in my \npigpen. Almost. \nA few weeks passed without anything happening. Then one of the clowns \ndisappeared. A man named Angus Dale. He’s been a member of the circus for \nalmost ten years now. No drink or drug problems, and no issues with his \npersonal life, nowhere particular else to go. Exactly no reason to up and vanish \nfrom his job without telling anyone where he’s going. They started a search of \nthe Marlborough Forest, they informed local police, they started discussing the \nbest ways to publicise the disappearance. \nI’m sure you can guess where this is going. Through it all there was this dark \nlittle suspicion growing in my mind. I never saw any evidence for it, not really. \nNothing that would stand up in court, but even so, the suspicion grew into a \ntheory, which grew into a certainty. That pig, that monster still squatted in my \nsty. The lock hadn’t been damaged or left open, so it was h", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 2, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 4500}}
