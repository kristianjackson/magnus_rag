It’s not really in the realms of “tragic loss of \na young life so full of potential”, but it’s still a long way from “I guess it was his \ntime”. I guess it just hit all of us that we were entering the period of our lives \nwhere sometimes people die. Life was no longer a given, and it wouldn’t \nactually be as long as all that before funerals were starting to outnumber the \nweddings. This was back in February and I’d just turned 34, but it played on my \nmind. Mortality. I just kept thinking to myself: the moment I die will feel just \nthe same as this one. It’s not a thing forever in the future; I will be in that \npresent just as surely as I am in this one. And I will end. I’ve never been a \n\nreligious man, and I always say I take comfort in the idea of a peaceful oblivion \nbut that’s a lie. I’m terrified. \nThe inheritance I received from Phil didn’t exactly do anything to calm my \nmind. It was listed in the inventory as his journal, but looking at it that didn’t \nseem right at all. It was clearly older than 37 years, with the black bookcloth \nfaded and worn away at the corners. For a second I wondered if maybe it was \nsome sort of family journal, passed down between generations, but then \nleaving it to me made even less sense. I still took it. I mean, what else are you \ngoing to do in a situation like that? It was larger than it had looked lying on the \ntable, and heavier, like one of those old family bibles you sometimes see in \nmuseums. I did have the decency to wait until the end of proceedings before I \ncarried it home and started to look on the Internet to try and see how much it \nmight be worth. \nThis was actually the first time I took a proper look at it. I don’t know, really, \nthe whole thing felt so surreal that actually examining the thing hadn’t quite \nfelt right when they first gave it to me. There wasn’t any obvious name on the \ncover, and I wondered if it might have had a dust wrapper that had been lost, \nbut it seemed far too large for anything like that to fit. Opening it up at the \nbeginning, it seemed to lack a proper title page as well, or any other form of \nidentification. Instead, printed there was a quote, though there wasn’t any \nattribution for it. \nIt read: “Life is a current which cannot be fought. It is a march with one \ndestination. You cannot cease your step nor move your course to one that \nskirts the journey’s termination.” \nAnd below it, in a faded blue ink was a handwritten message: \n\n“You have already read too much.” \nI laughed at this. I was starting to think that maybe Phil was finding one final \nway to be an asshole from beyond the grave. I’d never thought he’d actually \nhad much imagination, but a gruesome practical joke did seem the most likely \nexplanation at that point. So I turned the page to see what was next. \nThe next page was in Latin, but not printed Latin. It looked handmade, like \nthose old medieval books that monks used to write out. The ornate Gothic \nscript cascaded down the page, rigid and sharp. \nObviously I couldn’t read it. Even if I had the first clue about Latin, which I do \nnot, I could barely make out which letter was which. The next page was similar, \nand the one after that. It was almost twenty pages before the writing became \nsomething close to what I recognised. \nIt was English, but not like modern English. I’m not sure if it was Old- or \nMiddle- or whatever, but they tried to make me study The Canterbury Tales \nonce for English class, and it looked kind of like that. Close enough to real \nwords that you knew it was the same language, but it was spelt all wrong and \ndidn’t actually make much sense when you tried to read it. There were a \ncouple of words that stuck out, though. It seemed to be about someone called \nJulian, and “Deeth” cropped up a few times, which I assumed was “Death” and \neven one instance of the word “Homycide”, which I didn’t even know was a \nword back then. \nThe next pages were more of the same, though I did gradually get more and \nmore so I could understand it, each was in a very different hand, until it \nreached the entry on Christopher. This was one of the first with printed type, \nand like the others, had no real heading or formatting, just a solid block of text", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 1, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 4228}}
