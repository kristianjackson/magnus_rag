Perhaps, out there in the endless vast, they would not notice \nor recognise us in return. And I wish that I could convince myself that \nignorance was the same thing as safety, but then, how many weeds have you \nunthinkingly stepped on in your lifetime? \n \nStatement ends. \n \nMELANIE \nOh. That, um, well that seems... That seems to be … \n \n(Paper gets shuffled) \n \nThat’s all of it. Hm, well, Jan Kilbride definitely returned to Earth with his \ncolleagues, and he certainly seems to have given this statement in person, so... \nI mean, he did come back somehow. Assuming he ever left. It might have been \na hallucination of some sort. Isolation and stress can do odd things to you, of \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG106 ‘A Matter of Perspective’ \n \n9 \n \ncourse, not to mention the evident insomnia. And if it is true, if what Jan \nKilbride saw was real... I mean, to be honest it sounds a bit beyond my pay \ngrade. Whatever my pay grade is. And I have enough insomnia of my own to \ndeal with. \n \nI did do some checking on the Daedalus. I mean, you’ve got to do something, \nhaven’t you? Mr Kilbride seems to have the right of it in terms of his job; there \nhave been exactly zero peer-reviewed pieces of research that have in any way \nreferenced or cited studies or tests conducted on the Daedalus. From the point \nof view of the scientific community, the project might as well have never \nhappened. \n \nAlso, I, um, I can’t find Jan Kilbride. He definitely returned. I’ve found more \nthan one photograph of the trio’s arrival back on Earth – Carter Chilcott being \nattended to by medical personnel, and the other two looking tired, but alive. \nThere are also a couple of short newspaper stories mentioning their safe \nreturn. But it seems as though Kilbride made his way over to the Institute a few \nweeks after touchdown, made his statement and then... nothing. I can’t find \nany sign of him, and neither can Basira or Martin. Not on Earth, at least. I really \ndon’t want to say he vanished into thin air, but he’s vanished into something. \n \nBeyond that, there’s only a few things worth noti— \n \nBASIRA \nHey, you ready for that drink? \n \nMELANIE \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG106 ‘A Matter of Perspective’ \n \n10 \n \nOh, yes, yes. Just give me a second; finishing off a statement. \n \nBASIRA \nOh, sorry, I thought, you know, ‘cause the door was open... \n \nMELANIE \nNo, I just needed a bit of air flow. \n \nBASIRA \nYeah, it is not cool down here. \n \nMELANIE \nSummer in the basement, I suppose. \n \nBASIRA \nYeah. Speaking of not cool, didn’t Martin say he was coming today? \n \nMELANIE \nWow. Ouch. \n \nBASIRA \nOh, what, you’re gonna judge me? I literally don’t know anyone here you \nhaven’t made cry. \n \nMELANIE \nYou only know Tim and Martin. \n \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG106 ‘A Matter of Perspective’ \n \n11 \n \nBASIRA \nAnd Elias. \n \nMELANIE \nI made Elias cry? \n \nBASIRA \nI don’t know. Probably. You can be very mean. \n \nMELANIE \nRight, well, the jury’s still out on Elias. And anyway, Martin’s always been \nlovely to you. \n \nBASIRA \nMmm. You should have seen him when I turned up last year. I think he thought \nI was trying to steal his precious archivist. \n \nMELANIE \nAh... I got the exact same when John was hiding out and came to me with his \n“source on the inside” stuff. Martin was... not impressed. \n \nBASIRA \nOof. That boy needs to relax. \n \nMELANIE \nOr at least find someone else to fuss over. \n \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG106 ‘A Matter of Perspective’ \n \n12 \n \nBASIRA \nYeah, he’s got it bad. \n \nDo you know if he and John ever… \n \nMELANIE \nNo clue, and not interested. Although according to Georgie, John doesn’t. Like, \nat all. \n \nBASIRA \nOh. Yeah, that does explain some stuff. Wait, hang on, do I know Georgie? \n \nMELANIE \nI don’t think so. Georgie Barker? She does What the Ghost? \n \nBASIRA \nNo way, I used to love that show! I mean, the first couple of seasons, at least. \nTook a weird turn in Season 3, when they introduced— \n \nMELANIE \nWell, she and John, they dated. \n \nBASIRA \nYeah? \n \nMELANIE \nI mean, it was years ago, but—", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 4, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 4043}}
