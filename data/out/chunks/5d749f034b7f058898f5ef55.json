I’m Martin, this is John. \n[Rustling and sounds of sleeping bag zipper opening] \nARCHIVIST \nHello. \nUNNAMED \n(Suspicious) Right. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 191 – What We Lose \n \n7 \nMARTIN \nAnd you are…? \nUNNAMED \n(Firmly) No. \nMARTIN \n“No”? As in your name’s No? \nUNNAMED \nNo, as in ‘you don’t get to know my name’. I’m not stupid. \nARCHIVIST \nIs that so? \n[Sound of shoes being put on] \nUNNAMED \nNames are how they see you; the-they’re how they find you in the files. You \ncan hide all you want, but if they know your name, they can see you. And take \nyou away. \nARCHIVIST \nI see. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 191 – What We Lose \n \n8 \nUNNAMED \nI tell people my name, then maybe they learn it. Then they come for all of us. \nYou shouldn’t have told me yours. I keep telling the others! Only the prophet \nnames are safe. \nARCHIVIST \nThat’s not how it works! \nMARTIN \n(Warning) John... \nARCHIVIST \nWhat? She’s talking complete rubbish! \nUNNAMED \n(Angry) Have you been there, then? Have you fled through the endless \ncabinets, the, the labels that cut you? The things that ‘put you in your place’? \nARCHIVIST \nNo… \nUNNAMED \nSo you don’t know! \nARCHIVIST \nBut I’ve seen it! \nI know it. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 191 – What We Lose \n \n9 \nUNNAMED \nOh, you know it, do you? Did it bleed you? \nARCHIVIST \nNo, but that’s not actually— \nUNNAMED \nThen you don’t know it. And you’re not getting my name. \nARCHIVIST \nFine. \nSorry. I didn’t mean to upset you. \n…So… Georgie and Melanie, are they...? \nUNNAMED \nThey’re gone. \n(The Archivist makes a small noise of surprise) \nOut. \nThey, they often go out. Sometimes they bring people back, but usually they \njust go, for a while. \nMARTIN \nO-kay, huh. Do you know when they’ll be back? \nUNNAMED \nNo. They walk their own path. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 191 – What We Lose \n \n10 \nARCHIVIST \nCourse they do. \n(Beat) \n(Unnamed sighs) \nUNNAMED \nWould you like some food? We have... tins. And biscuits. Although the biscuits \nare really old. \nMARTIN \nWhat’s in the tins? \nUNNAMED \nFood. \nMARTIN \n(Irritated) What food? \nUNNAMED \nDepends. Most of the labels are gone. Yesterday, I got black beans. \nMARTIN \nOh right. And that’s... good? \nUNNAMED \nMm-hmm! \n(Martin exhales slowly) \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 191 – What We Lose \n \n11 \nMARTIN \nRight. Well, I could probably go for a... tin. John? \nARCHIVIST \nAny chance you could bring me something back? I’m feeling a little bit shaky. \nMARTIN \nDo you need to make a statement? \nARCHIVIST \nActually no, I… I haven’t since we got down here. Suppose it must be the \ntunnels. Nice to be a bit more in control, although, it does feel… odd. \nMARTIN \nWell, it’s good to hear. I’ll see what I can find. \n[Door creaks] \nUNNAMED \nAre you coming? \nMARTIN \nYes, yes. Lead the way... you. \n[Footsteps as Martin heads for the door] \nUNNAMED \nOf course. \n[Door rattles as they leave] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 191 – What We Lose \n \n12 \n[Tape clicks off] \n[Tape clicks on] \n[An echoing room in the tunnels] \n[Sound of Arun handling the tape recorder] \n[Footsteps] \nARUN \n(Close) Uh… Martin? \nMARTIN \nYeah? Oh, s-sorry, I-I didn’t catch you name. \nARUN \nArun. \nMARTIN \nHi Arun, what’s up? \nARUN \nSorry, ju… um, just, um, did you lose a tape recorder? I found this— \n[Tape recorder handling noises] \nARUN (CONT’D) \nOh… Huh. \nMARTIN \nYeah, it wasn’t on when you found it, right? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 191 – What We Lose \n \n13 \n(Slight chuckle) \nARUN \nNo. Is it yours? I haven’t seen it before, I thought it might be. \nMARTIN \nKind of, I guess? They follow us around a bit. \nARUN \nReally? \nMARTIN \nOh, y-you don’t need to worry. It’s been happening for ages. Before the world \nchanged, even. You can just ignore them. \nARUN \nSince before the end? \nMARTIN \nYeah, it’s… it’s kind of a long story. Ask the prophets, if you want, they’ll \nexplain. \n[Martin turns and starts to walk away, then stops as Arun \ncontinues] \nARUN \nYou don’t believe in them, do you?
