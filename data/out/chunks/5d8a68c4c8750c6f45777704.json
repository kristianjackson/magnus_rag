The Magnus Archives. Episode one hundred and sixty: \n\"The Eye Opens.\" \n[Theme finishes] \n[Tape clicks on] \n[Movement as Martin arrives in the room; sound of tape recorder \nbeing put down; other small items being moved in the room] \nMARTIN \nEverything alright? \nARCHIVIST \nJust, making sure it works. \nMARTIN \nI still don’t think we should have brought it. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 160 – The Eye Opens \n \n2 \nARCHIVIST \nOh, it’s better than no warning at all. \n(Agreement sound from Martin) \nEspecially if I’m trying not to, uh.. See things, you know? \nMARTIN \nI guess. \nYou’re unpacked then? \n[Sounds of items being moved] \nARCHIVIST \n(Warm) Hm? Oh, yes; much as I can without any wardrobes to speak of, at \nleast. \nMARTIN \n(Light) Yeah, it’s- it’s not exactly the Ritz. \nARCHIVIST \nWell, it technically still belongs to Daisy, so… I’m just glad it’s not some sort of \nkill room. \nMARTIN \n(Joking) Or, (huffed laugh) or it is, and she just cleaned it up really well. \n(They both make uncomfortable chuckles) \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 160 – The Eye Opens \n \n3 \nARCHIVIST \n…Yes. \n(The Archivist makes an uneasy noise) \nMARTIN \nAre we? \nAre we.. safe here? \nARCHIVIST \n(Sigh) Safe as anywhere else. If Elias wanted to find us, I imagine he could, \nbut… I doubt the police would be able to. If nothing else, I’m hoping there’d be \nsome… jurisdiction complications, in Scotland or something? \nMARTIN \n(Scoffs) Some— somehow I don’t think Daisy will be worried about \njurisdictions. \nARCHIVIST \nI— I don’t think she’d come here. Doesn’t look like this place has been used for \nyears. \nMARTIN \nAnd if she does? \nARCHIVIST \n(Sigh) Well. At least we’ll know where she is. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 160 – The Eye Opens \n \n4 \nMARTIN \nWh— \n(He cuts himself off and exhales) \nARCHIVIST \nBesides, I’m more worried about the other Hunters. Or the… Sasha thing. Last I \nheard, they still hadn’t found any bodies. (big inhale) A lot of destruction, a lot \nof blood. (exhales) But that’s it. \n[Sounds of items being moved] \nMARTIN \nYou think they’re still out there? \nARCHIVIST \nHopefully a long way out there. (soft) But I think we’re okay. \n(Beat) \n(Energetic) Not much in the way of food, is there. \nMARTIN \nOh, n-no, not yet. I was actually gonna head down into the village to go pick \nsomething up? \nARCHIVIST \nHm. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 160 – The Eye Opens \n \n5 \nMARTIN \nMaybe give Basira a call to check in, ‘cause Daisy apparently couldn’t pick a \nsafehouse with a signal, so.... \nARCHIVIST \nI think that’s rather the point. \nMARTIN \nMm. \nARCHIVIST \nAnyway, don’t tell me the phonebox down there doesn’t appeal to your retro \naesthetic. \nMARTIN \nIt might. Maybe. \n[Martin zips a bag] \nMARTIN (CONT’D) \nYou’ll be okay here? \nARCHIVIST \nI’ll be fine. \n[Tape clicks off] \n[Tape clicks on] \n[A fire crackles indoors] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 160 – The Eye Opens \n \n6 \n[Footsteps on wood as Martin enters the room] \nARCHIVIST \nHow was she? \nMARTIN \nOh, same as last week. \nARCHIVIST \nInstitute still crawling with police? \nMARTIN \nI mean, they’ve finished all the interviews? Apparently they’re calling it a \n“terror attack”. \nARCHIVIST \nDoesn’t surprise me. Heh. Appropriate, in a way. \nMARTIN \nMm. \nARCHIVIST \nDoes she know who they’re looking to blame? \nMARTIN \nThey’re not really talking to her about it? Sectioned or not, I guess ex-police \nonly gets you so far. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 160 – The Eye Opens \n \n7 \nARCHIVIST \nMm. Does she know if they’ve found the old prison yet, the panopticon, Eli— \n(hard edge) Magnus’s body. \nMARTIN \nI don’t know how hard they’re looking, to be honest? \nBasira says a few of them got lost in the tunnels for over a day— \n(The Archivist snickers) \n—and it’s not like the promise of an old man’s corpse is much of a motivator. \nARCHIVIST \nMm. \nMARTIN \nStill, she did manage to talk them out of burning the whole place to the \nground? Oh-ah! Actually, that reminds me, um… \n[Jostling sounds as Martin presents a package] \nARCHIVIST \nAh, these-these are the statements. \nMARTIN \nAh yes. Basira said last week she’d send some up as soon as the Archives \nweren’t a crime scene. \nARCHIVIST \nYes.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 0, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 4382}}
