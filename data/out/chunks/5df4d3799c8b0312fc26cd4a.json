I haven’t seen it before, I thought it might be. \nMARTIN \nKind of, I guess? They follow us around a bit. \nARUN \nReally? \nMARTIN \nOh, y-you don’t need to worry. It’s been happening for ages. Before the world \nchanged, even. You can just ignore them. \nARUN \nSince before the end? \nMARTIN \nYeah, it’s… it’s kind of a long story. Ask the prophets, if you want, they’ll \nexplain. \n[Martin turns and starts to walk away, then stops as Arun \ncontinues] \nARUN \nYou don’t believe in them, do you? In their power? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 191 – What We Lose \n \n14 \nMARTIN \nI... knew them in the old days. \nARUN \nSo did Laverne. \nMARTIN \nYeah, I, I realise that. Just— \nLook, it’s complicated, okay? It’s just a big pile of stuff that no-one \nunderstands. \nARUN \n(Pointedly) I understand they are able to walk through this world without fear \nor danger. \n(Martin exhales his irritation) \nI understand they saved us. \nMARTIN \nCool. \n…Look, y-you should really talk to them about it, okay I, I don’t want to say the \nwrong thing. \nARUN \nThey said… you also walked through the nightmares. That you ‘share their \npower’. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 191 – What We Lose \n \n15 \nMARTIN \nOoh, I’m not sure… \nIt’s different, alright? W-We’re different. \nARUN \nYes. You are. \nWhen I look at them, I see a future. I see hope. I don’t know what I see when I \nlook at you. \n(Noises of disbelief from Martin) \nMARTIN \nOkay, well... You’re rude. \nARUN \nI’m a poet. I speak the truth. \nMARTIN \nYeah? Well… your truth is rude! You don’t know anything about us. Who we \nare, what we’re doing. \nARUN \nI know you look at us like we’re idiots. \n(Martin snorts) \nYou pity us. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 191 – What We Lose \n \n16 \nMARTIN \nThat’s not true. \nARUN \nLiar! (raised voice) Who are you? \n(Noise of annoyance from Martin) \nJust appearing from nowhere with… phantom tape recorders just scuttling in \nyour wake? Why are you here? \nMARTIN \n(Agitated) We’re here to save the world, okay? Right? If you want more than \nthat, go ask your prophets, okay? Now just… Give me that! \n[Martin grabs the tape recorder] \n[Tape clicks off] \n[Tape clicks on] \n[The tunnel room where Martin and the Archivist slept] \n[Door opens as Martin returns; tins and other items placed down] \nARCHIVIST \nAny sign of them? \nMARTIN \nNo, but the others say it’s pretty normal for them to be gone this long. \nARCHIVIST \nRight. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 191 – What We Lose \n \n17 \n[Cutlery placed down] \nMARTIN \nThat said, the, uh, ‘locals’ are getting restless. \nARCHIVIST \nMmm. \nMARTIN \nI-I get the impression our welcome isn’t exactly unconditional. \nHow’s the, uh, fuzziness? \nARCHIVIST \nIt’s alright. Comes and goes. \nMARTIN \nYeah, you don’t seem as bad as you were at Salesa’s. Hopefully you won’t \nforget everything as soon as you leave the tunnels. \nARCHIVIST \nI don’t think I will. It was worse there, though, obviously... \nMARTIN \n(Crosstalk) You don’t remember. \nARCHIVIST \n(Crosstalk) I don’t remember. \n…So, what do you think? You reckon they’re going to help? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 191 – What We Lose \n \n18 \nMARTIN \nI mean, they’ve got to, right? You-you’re basically humanity’s only hope, huh. \nARCHIVIST \nI mean... okay, um… (nervous chuckle) I hadn’t really— \nMARTIN \nO-oh s-sorry! That’s probably a bit too much pressure, yeah? \nARCHIVIST \nA-A bit? \nMARTIN \nI-I-I just meant that, look, either they help or they just sit down here and hope \nit all magically works itself out. And they can’t really think that’s an option. \nCan they? \nARCHIVIST \nI don’t know. I know how Georgie gets about people in her care. If she thinks \nhelping us will endanger them... \nMARTIN \nYeah. Melanie too. \nARCHIVIST \nMmm.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 2, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 3867}}
