There was no record of it being used as a halfway \nhouse, certainly not one connected to the local Catholic diocese although the \nChurch of England records for the area that Sasha got access to were \nunfortunately incomplete. The older residents of Hill Top Road back up the \naccount given by the nurse, Anna Kasuma, as related here. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG008 – Burned Out \n13 \n \nTim managed to organise an interview with Mrs Kasuma but she apparently \ncould provide no further information beyond what she told to Mr Lensik. She \ndid admit though to asking Father Burroughs to take a look at the house as she \nwas worried about it and had seen him perform exorcisms before. There \ndoesn’t seem to be any print evidence of what happened to the house; no \nnews stories or similar regarding the fire. But one resident did provide a \nphotograph of the house in flames. \nRaymond Fielding’s obituary briefly reported his death as having been due to a \nhouse fire and lauds his work with troubled youth but gives no details about \neither. Agnes remains something of a mystery as we have not been able to find \nany definitive proof that she even existed. Except… We cannot prove any \nconnection but Martin unearthed a report on a Agnes Montague who was \nfound dead in her Sheffield flat on the evening of November 23rd 2006, the \nsame day Mr Lensik claims to have uprooted the tree. She had hanged herself. \nHer age is given at 26 which doesn’t match up at all. But tied by a chain to her \nwaist was a severed human hand, a right hand. Its owner was never identified \nbut the coroner was apparently quite perplexed, as tissue decay would seem \nto indicate that the hand’s original owner must have died at almost the exact \nsame time as Agnes. \nTwo families have lived in the house since this statement was originally made \nbut no further manifestations have been reported on Hill Top Road. \nRecording Ends. \n[The Magnus Archives Theme - Outro] \n \nThe Magnus Archives is a podcast distributed by Rusty Quill and licensed under \na creative commons attribution, non-commercial share alike 4.0 international \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG008 – Burned Out \n14 \n \nlicense.
