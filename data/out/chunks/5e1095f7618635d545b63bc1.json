The rides still whirred and rang and \njangled, but every person there had gone completely still, their eyes locked on \nthe mangled mess of broken limbs and shattered bone. \nIt was the carnie that went first, vaulting over the side of the coconut shy with \nan unexpected agility. Then it was as if a dam had broken, and every half-\nwasted figure descended on the twisted corpse. Our interloper had to look \naway, or risk being sick at the sight of so many spindly bodies swarming, biting, \nrotten teeth and swollen gums tearing at the still-twitching body of the \nunfortunate soul from the roller coaster. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 156 – Reflection \nWhen he told me of the hunger he saw in their eyes, his legs were shaking so \nbadly, he had to turn away. His eyes fell instead on the coconut shy, and he \nfinally got a good look at what were propped up as targets. \nWhat stared back at him certainly had hair, but they most definitely were not \ncoconuts. \nHe staggered backwards as a shock passed through him, colliding with a nearby \ntrash can and sending it clattering to the floor. He tried to regain his footing, \nbut something underneath him rolled away, and he slipped, falling on top of \nthe heap of bones from the overturned garbage. \nThey were too large to be animal bones, he was sure of it, and every one of \nthem had been picked clean and cracked open, the marrow sucked from them \nto leave nothing but dry, white fragments. \nPulling himself painfully to his feet, he glanced back at the crowd, and saw that \nseveral of them on the edge, those that had no hopes of reaching the corpse, \nhad clearly heard the commotion, and were starting to walk warily towards \nhim. \nHe tells me he was suddenly very aware of just how much flesh was on his \nbody. \nHe turned and ran back into the funhouse. \nI do envy you your gifts sometimes, Gertrude. His account of their pursuit \nthrough the mirror-maze was honestly so disjoint that I was unable to follow it. \nEven after he tried to take me through it two, or even three times. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 156 – Reflection \nWithout the Eye’s clarifying influence, panic can make details… difficult to \nremember. \nThey shouted at him, certainly, but his stark terror appears to have robbed him \nof the memory of their words. \nJudging by the bite marks on his wrist, I think it’s safe to assume that one of \nthem caught him, at least for a moment, but he claims he can remember \nnothing of the sort. \nI can at least say for certain that he managed to lose his pursuers long enough \nto return to the warped mirrors. He then took what I consider to be his only \nsensible action in the entire affair: Rather than running straight to the mirror \nwhich distorted him into a thin, angular figure, he took a moment to look into \neach one, and one of them showed no reflection at all. \nHis next action of running full pelt into it was perhaps less inspired, but it does \nseem to have been effective, since when he regained consciousness, covered \nin blood and broken glass, he was once again in the silent darkness of the \nabandoned Bright Lake amusement park he had made the unwise decision to \nbreak into. \nI don’t believe the party ever happened, which is almost certainly for the best. \nSo? What are your thoughts. I’m keen to hear your own interpretation of this \none. My first assumption would have been the Flesh, based on the cannibalism \nand strangeness of the bodies involved, but- something about this idea of \nsome sort of famine world, its location within a man-made ruin, the whole… \nsocietal aspect of it- I’d be inclined to chalk this up as a genuine Extinction \nmanifestation.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 4, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 3724}}
