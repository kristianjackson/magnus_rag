We didn’t exactly part on the best of \nterms. \nMELANIE \nMm. \nARCHIVIST \nWhat exactly do you need from us anyway? Can’t your showbiz friends help \nyou? \nMELANIE \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 063 – The End of the Tunnel \n \n16 \n \nNo, I’m... most of... most of them won’t talk to me anymore. \nARCHIVIST \nWhat happened? Did word get out that you’d given a statement to us? What \nwas it, “credulous idiots”? \nMELANIE \nNot exactly... look, in my business your reputation is all that you have. \nARCHIVIST \nHm. \nMELANIE \nThe industry’s mainly full of sceptics pretending to be believers pretending to \nbe sceptics. \nARCHIVIST \nI think the word you’re looking for is charlatans. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 063 – The End of the Tunnel \n \n17 \n \nMELANIE \nCan you not? Please? I’m to... look, Ghost Hunt UK split up. I mean, not \nformally, but... well, you know, Pete was always a flake to begin with, and the \nothers just drifted away. \nARCHIVIST \nI’m sorry to hear that. I noticed you weren’t updating any more. \nMELANIE \nI tried to get a new crew together, but it was tough. I took to going on \nexpeditions solo, but I don’t really have the skills to get useable footage. I saw \na few weird things. Then I... then I got arrested. \nARCHIVIST \nGo on. \nMELANIE \nYes, I, um... I broke into the train graveyard up near Rotherham, got picked up \nby security and I... I wasn’t doing well. When I was being thrown out, some late \nnight dogwalker got a video of me screaming at them about ghosts, and when \nit went online... \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 063 – The End of the Tunnel \n \n18 \n \nARCHIVIST \nYour all-important professional reputation went with it. \nMELANIE \nYes. Look, I have leads that I really need to follow up, but as far as my \ncolleagues are concerned, these days I’m the ghost. \nARCHIVIST \nWell, for what it’s worth, I’m sorry. I do know what it’s like to lack the respect \nof your peers. I’ll have a word with Diana, see if I can get you into the library. \nMELANIE \nThank you. Seriously. Now how do I get out of this place? \n[Chair scraping] \nARCHIVIST \nHm? Oh, Sasha can show you out. \nMELANIE \nSasha? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 063 – The End of the Tunnel \n \n19 \n \nARCHIVIST \nYes, she should be around here somewhere. \nMELANIE \nOh. Right. Well, let me know about the library, okay? \n[Door opening] \nARCHIVIST \nWill do. \n[Door closing] \nARCHIVIST \nWhat a strange woman. \nEnd supplemental. \n[Tape clicks off.] \nThe Magnus Archives is a podcast distributed by Rusty Quill and licensed under \na Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Sharealike 4.0 International \nlicence. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 063 – The End of the Tunnel \n \n20 \n \nToday’s episode was written by Jonathan Sims and directed by Alexander J \nNewall. \nIt featured: Jonathan Sims as The Archivist and Lydia Nicholas as Melanie King.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 6, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 2850}}
