She had a thing on her \nhead, like a... I don’t know. \n(Concerned breath from the Archivist) \nLike a, a woolly hat? But… I-I don’t know, it looked a bit weird. \nARCHIVIST \nA-Annabelle, oh— \nCELIA \nOh, I didn’t catch her name— \nARCHIVIST \nShh-shh-shh! I— Please, I, I need to concentrate. \n[Hissing static starts] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \n(Very quietly) Where are you, Martin? Come on, come on, come on; don’t do \nthis to me. Not now… Argh! Oh god. Okay, okay, um... \n[Hissing static ends] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 194 – Parting \n \n22 \nCELIA \nAre you alright? \nARCHIVIST \nWe, uh— I need to talk to the ah, the, th-the prophets. \nCELIA \nWhat’s going on? \nARCHIVIST \n(Snarling) Now! \n[Tape clicks off] \n[Tape clicks on] \n[In the tunnels, the Archivist opens the door to Leitner’s room, \nstepping in once more] \nMELANIE \nAny luck? \nARCHIVIST \n(Frustrated) Nothing. Is-is Georgie back yet? \nMELANIE \nNot yet. But then she actually needs to go places to look at them. She can’t just \npop up top and check ‘the big picture’. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 194 – Parting \n \n23 \nARCHIVIST \nMelanie, please, not now. \nMELANIE \n…Sorry. \n(Melanie sighs) \n[The Archivist closes the door] \nMELANIE (CONT’D) \nSo, you, you didn’t see them at all with your, y’know…? \nARCHIVIST \nNothing. They’re hidden. Annabelle must have taken the camera. \nMELANIE \nThe camera? \nARCHIVIST \nAh, from Salesa’s. \nMELANIE \nO-oh. So does that mean he’s...? \nARCHIVIST \n(Quiet) Dead. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 194 – Parting \n \n24 \nMELANIE \nRight. \nARCHIVIST \nYes. I, I checked. I guess she liked him enough to do that for him before she \nstole it. \nMELANIE \nRemind me not to get on her good side. \nARCHIVIST \nNo, i-it’s what he wanted. W-what he said he wanted. \n[The Archivist starts pacing] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nBut… it-it-it it means there’s, there’s no way I can find them! \nMELANIE \nHey, hey, hey! \nARCHIVIST \nAnd I— \n[He stops pacing] \nMELANIE \nKeep it together. Okay. Georgie might have better luck. She’s actually looking \nin person, and from what you said... \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 194 – Parting \n \n25 \nARCHIVIST \nYeah. No. I, I mean that, that could work. But… But if she finds them alone! \nWh… (stuttering) I mean, if anything were to happen! \nMELANIE \nThey can handle themselves. Right? \nARCHIVIST \nYou’re right. You’re, you’re right. \n[Melanie clutches her folded cane] \nMELANIE \nIt’s, it’s fine. I’m worried too. \nARCHIVIST \nThis is my fault. \nMELANIE \nWhat? \nARCHIVIST \nWe… We had an argument. I said some things I shouldn’t have. I-if I hadn’t we \nwould’ve come back here together, and I, I-I’d have been there to stop her \ntaking him. \nMELANIE \nYou don’t know that’s what happened. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 194 – Parting \n \n26 \nARCHIVIST \nI mean, he wouldn’t have gone willingly! \nWould he? \nMELANIE \nYou tell me. You said there was no sign of a struggle. \nARCHIVIST \nBut if it happened in the tunnel, I can’t Know that! \nMELANIE \nBut we'd have heard. Stuff echoes down here. \nARCHIVIST \nI suppose. \nWhat, so you think he chose to leave with her? \nMELANIE \nDoes it matter right now? \nARCHIVIST \nI mean, if they left together willingly, they could already be miles away. \nMELANIE \n(Heavy sigh) Yeah. And you can’t— I, I don’t know, see where your blind spot \nis? If you know what I mean. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 194 – Parting \n \n27 \nARCHIVIST \nNot unless I’m right next to it. \nMELANIE \nRight. Fine. So… we do this the old-fashioned way. \nARCHIVIST \nWhat? \nMELANIE \nWhy would she take him? Uh, do they have any history? \nARCHIVIST \nNot really. \nMELANIE \nSo what other reason might she want him? \nARCHIVIST \nTo get to me? To turn him against us, or, or make him an offer or... I don’t \nknow, she serves The Web, so it’s-it’s probably some bullshit domino cause-\nand-effect thing we can’t even begin to guess. \nMELANIE \nOkay, probably, okay, probably; but it doesn’t do us much good to worry about \nthat now! Uh, okay. Let’s say, she wanted to use him as bait, to lure you \nsomewhere.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 6, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 4186}}
