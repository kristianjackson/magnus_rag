For hours he holds that position, dreading every \nmoment that the next motion of the thing they construct will break him like \nthin porcelain. And then it comes: Not another stepping impact, for those are \nrare and ponderous, but the agonized pull of the whole trying to lift itself. \nEvery muscle in every body tenses all at once, and Edward finds himself \nmoving, pushed and squeezed and gasping for space and… free. \nWithout warning, he finds himself in open air, forced out of the thing like a \nshoot pushing up through the soil. He takes in a deep breath, his protesting \nlimbs now limp and almost useless, and collapses upon a ground that looks up \nat him in envy. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 174 – The Great Beast \n6 \nNo. Not a ground. For it is only now that Edward realizes how thin the air is, \nhow cold it is without the warmth of uncountable bodies surrounding him on \nall sides. \nBehind him he can see the shifting sea of people stretching out forever, but in \nfront of him, a few hundred meters away, there is what appears to be... an \nedge. \nIn a place where time has meaning it might be said it takes Edward hours, days \nto drag himself over the writhing floor. But eventually he finds himself laying \nupon that horizon, willing himself to look out, over, and down, see where he is. \nIf there is any place to which he might escape. \nAnd so finally, he looks. \n[With a swirl of wind comes the thunderous earth-quaking boom, \nloud and clear] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nHis stomach drops, and his arms seize as he looks upon a hundred miles of \nslowly-moving humanity down to a stark and barren ground far below. It is so \nfar down that if he climbed for a year he would not reach the end of it. \nHis tears fall down and away into the open sky. His teeth lock in fear and he \nbeings to try and move backwards, away from the precipice. \nBut there is a movement. A shift in the people below him as the great beast \nstretches some part of itself. A wave of spasming limbs passes beneath \nEdward, and in a moment he is flung, upwards and away, out into the empty \nair below. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 174 – The Great Beast \n7 \nHe is falling. He cannot breathe as the air is forced from his lungs and the \nrazor-cold wind lashes at his skin. He is falling. The beast he was once a part of \nis a blur beside him as he plummets, human forms lost in the strange, moving \ntexture. He is falling, and he is so small and so afraid he wonders if he will ever \nhit the ground. He does not want to die smeared over that flat and hateful \nwasteland far below, and he flails, limbs throwing themselves violently around, \ntrying to catch a hold of something, anything to save himself. \nEdward feels a hand grip his. The stop is sudden, violent, wrenching his \nshoulder from its socket with a wet pop. He screams in pain but also in relief as \nhe hangs there, suspended above his fate. Despite his dread, it takes only a \nmoment for him to make his decision. He reaches out with his other arm and \nfeels it gripped by a dozen hands as slowly, inexorably, Edward allows himself \nto be pulled back into the great, suffering colossus. Far below, there is another \nimpact— \n[A thunderous earth-quaking boom] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \n—as if something were being stepped on. \n[Hissing static starts] \n[Tape clicks off] \n[Tape clicks on] \n[Blustery wind; gritty footsteps as Martin and the Archivist walk] \n(Martin makes a small sigh) \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 174 – The Great Beast \n8 \nMARTIN \n(Irritated) Is it much further? \n(The Archivist makes an amused exhale) \nARCHIVIST \n(Amused) Yes. \n(Martin sighs dramatically) \nI'm not entirely sure what you were expecting; it's the Vast.
