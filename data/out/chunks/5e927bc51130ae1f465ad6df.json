Blackwood. \n The streets are hard in London. \n Paved in old secrets, the hot smell after the rains. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG079 – Hide and Seek \n2 \n \n The threads of people walking, living, lovi– \n[The click of the tape cuts off the rest of the poem. There are footsteps.] \nMARTIN \nYou’re sure about this? He did tell us to go home… \nTIM \nYeah, and then he said, “Sorry for everything”. Something’s up. \nMARTIN \nYou don’t think he’s going to… y’know… \nTIM \nI don’t know. But he’s going to do something, and it’s going to be bad. And I \ndon’t mean like ‘sneaking a cigarette’ bad. Like properly bad. \nMARTIN \nSo we need to help him? \nTIM \nWe need to stop him. \nMARTIN \nAnd… we needed my tape recorder because… \nTIM \nBecause something tells me we’re going to need evidence by the end of today. \nI don’t want to wind up in court without something to back me up. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG079 – Hide and Seek \n3 \n \nMARTIN \nCourt? \nTIM \nYeah. Er, tribunal if we’re lucky, inquest if we’re not. \nMARTIN \nYou did use a new tape, didn’t you? \nTIM \nYeah, I took one off the pile. \nMARTIN \nWas it blank or… Tim? \nTIM \nIt was blank. \nMARTIN \nHe’s never going to speak to us again. \nTIM \nDon’t get my hopes up. \n[The office door opens] \nMARTIN \nJohn? \nTIM \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG079 – Hide and Seek \n4 \n \nAaaaaand he’s gone. Thought so. \nMARTIN \nYou don’t think he’s going to… \nTIM \nI don’t know, Martin! I think he’s going fully off the deep end, is what I think. If \nhe hasn’t already. \n[The office door closes. Martin and Tim continue walking round the Archives] \nMARTIN \nLook, I know you don’t like him… \nTIM \nGot that, did you? \nMARTIN \nBut I’m not going to help you get him fired. \nTIM \nMartin! What do you think is happening here? This isn’t office politics. It’s not \nlike he’s had one too many at the Christmas party and started ranting about \nthe Greeks. Whatever is happening here it’s literally supernatural. \nMARTIN \nReally? Isn’t that a little… y’know? \nTIM \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG079 – Hide and Seek \n5 \n \nNo, it isn’t “a little y’know”. There is something in this place, and it’s messing \nup our heads. It watches us all the time. It stops me quitting. I’m pretty sure it \nwould stop Elias firing John even if he decided to try actually running the place \nfor once. \nMARTIN \nYou’re sure you don’t just want to stay? \nTIM \nI’m sure. \nMARTIN \nBut, like, deep down – \nTIM \nNo. \nMARTIN \nOh. (Pause) \nSo you really think the Institute is, what, haunted? \nTIM \nI used to. Now I think it’s worse. \nMARTIN \nWorse how? \n[A sudden crash] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG079 – Hide and Seek \n6 \n \nNOT!SASHA \n(Loudly) Jooooohhhn! \nTIM \nOh god! What the hell was that?! \nMARTIN \nOh no nonononono! \n[Not!Sasha roars, and then there’s sound of heavy breathing and Tim and \nMartin run. The trapdoor opens and there’s a silence as Tim and Martin wait \nto see whether they’re safe.] \nTIM \nWhat the hell was that? \nMARTIN \nIt… er… It looked… It kinda looked… \nTIM \nOh don’t say it. \nMARTIN \nIt did, though, didn’t it? \nTIM \nThat wasn’t Sasha. \nMARTIN \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG079 – Hide and Seek \n7 \n \nNo. No, no, it wasn’t. You don’t… you don’t think – \nTIM \nHe told her to go home. Like us! \nMARTIN \nYeah. \nTIM \nAnd she did. \nMARTIN \nYeah. (Pause) \nIt went into the tunnels. \nTIM \nNope. No. Not happening. \nMARTIN \nWe can’t just leave him. \nTIM \nYeah, we can. \nMARTIN \nI’m going. \nTIM \nMartin!
