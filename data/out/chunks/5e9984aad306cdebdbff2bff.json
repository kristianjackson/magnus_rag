It was a small \nritual, but an important one, and given it was just down the road, I figured I \nmight as well go and see if the gym was still open. Since no-one ever seemed \nto be around, I figured, maybe no-one locked it overnight. \nSo at about half past eleven last Wednesday night, I found myself gently \npushing open the door to my gym. It wasn’t locked, just as I guessed, and \neverything inside seemed quiet. I headed through into the changing room, and \nthere was my phone, where it had fallen in my locker. I grabbed it, and was just \nabout to leave, when I heard movement coming from the gym itself, and \nnearly jumped out of my skin. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG090 – Body Builder \n12 \n \nI should have left. I should have turned right around and marched out of that \nplace, but instead I felt a… rage building inside me. Whoever was in there, it \nwas almost midnight, how dare they come in sneaking around like that, trying \nto give me a heart attack! I set my face hard, and walked through, preparing to \ngive Marie, or whoever it was, a piece of my mind. \nThe lights in the gym were off, but I could see movement over near the \ngymnastics equipment, someone swinging back and forth on the parallel bars. \nIt was a smooth, rhythmic motion, down and around and up and over, around \nand over, up and down. Sometimes the movement flew up, releasing the bars \nfor a moment, before deftly catching them on the way down. There was no \nsound as I got closer, apart from the faint slap of hands gripping and releasing \nthe wood of the beams. If it was Marie, I’d never seen her doing anything like \nthis before. I walked over, and turned on the overhead lights. \nIt was not Marie, swinging round and about on the bars. Marie only had two \narms. Marie had legs. And Marie had a head. The thing that swung and flipped \nand twirled around the bars was nothing like Marie, though its flesh looked \nhuman enough. It did have a smile, though, stitched… right in the centre of its \ntorso. \nI screamed so hard I tore something in my throat. I don’t know if it heard me. I \ndon’t know if it even had ears. But it wasn’t alone, and the other things in that \nplace did hear me, because as I ran back and out through the changing rooms, \nall the lockers were opening. What came climbing out of them had once been \npeople, I’m sure of that, and they called to me, offering to help ‘perfect’ me. \nTo help me achieve my ideal body. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG090 – Body Builder \n13 \n \nJ was there, standing his full height. A distended, jagged body bared in all its \ntwisted grandeur, and he shook his head in frustration. He said something, I \nthink, but I couldn’t make it out. It might have been “too soon”. \nI try to remember some of them in detail, the confusion of limbs and joints and \nmuscles, but all I can remember is the happy, joyful way they called to me. \nTold me that the pain was worth it. It makes me sick that a small, sharp part of \nme wishes I’d stayed to listen. \nI never went back. I called Marie and told her what happened, but she didn’t \nbelieve me. At least, I hope she didn’t. Because if she did, then some of the \nquestions she asked make very worried for her indeed. \nStatement ends. \nMARTIN \nThe, um… the supplemental materials that should go with this statement, \nproviding more details on addresses, names, and stuff, seems to be missing, so \nwe don’t have any way of tracking down the gym, or finding out the name the \nbusiness might be operating under. Not without a 2013 copy of the Aberdeen \nYellow Pages. A bit of relief, in some ways. I tried to contact Mr. Davenport \nabout it, and did get through, but he told me to… um, he… he… wishes no \nfurther contact with the Institute. \nMelanie looked into Marie Balandin, though. In 2011 and 2012, she did really \nwell in several IFBB competitions, but it looks like she disappeared around the \ntime of this statement. No missing persons report was ever filed, but there’s \nno record of her anywhere after that.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 4, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 4035}}
