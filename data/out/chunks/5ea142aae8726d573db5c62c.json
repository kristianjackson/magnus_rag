It \nwasn’t cigarette smoke, though, or Sarah’s strange perfume. It smelled of \ncopper, with another scent beneath it, acrid and sour, with the faintest hint of \nammonia. I’ll, I’ll admit it, I was scared. Scared enough that I didn’t even think \nabout how great the whole thing would have looked in our show. I didn’t look \ninto the camera, or provide any commentary, or make any move except \nkeeping a close watch on the display. \nAs I walked up the stairs towards the upper floor, I began to hear something. It \nsounded like someone was talking. It was low, quick and desperate, with an \nedge to it that sounded almost like pleading. It was coming from one of the \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG028 – Skin Tight \n11 \n \nsmaller patient rooms off to the side. I slowly crept towards it, feeling absurd \nabout how terrified I was about being seen. \nI reached the door and, using the camera, I peered inside. Sarah was there, \nwith her bag next to her. She was gesticulating wildly and talking, though I \ncouldn’t see anyone else in the room with her. I couldn’t make out most of it, \nthough I heard the words “trespass” and “unintended” several times, and \nwhispered apologies. I was almost about to call out to her, when she suddenly \nstood bolt upright. It seemed like she was struggling to breathe. Then I heard \nan impact, and Sarah seemed to be flung across the room by a heavy blow. She \nhit the wall hard, and I heard a crack as she slumped down, a smear of blood \nleft on the wall. \nI froze. I didn’t know what to do. Part of me wanted to run over and see if she \nwas alright, but I just couldn’t bring myself to move. After a second or two, \nSarah stirred. She shouted something into the room, this time in a language I \ndidn’t understand, and dragged herself to her feet. She removed her jacket \nand I saw that there was something very wrong with her left arm. Bits of it \nseemed to be hanging off where it had hit the wall. She gripped it with her \nright hand and, er… well, this is where my colleagues would laugh me out of \nthe industry. She peeled off the skin of her left arm. As if she was taking off a \nglove. I saw it stretch and come away from whatever was beneath. In the \ncamera’s small viewscreen I couldn’t see what was there, what was \nunderneath, but it was dark and shiny. I will never forget the sound of the skin \ncoming away from her arm. \nOnce she had taken it off, she stretched it, and then slipped it back over her \nhand, pulling it until it was tight. She reached into her bag and, from beneath \nthe packets of cigarettes, she pulled out a staple gun. Around the edges of the \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG028 – Skin Tight \n12 \n \nskin, where it met the rest of her, she slowly and deliberately stapled the skin \ndown. \nI don’t know why that was the point I ran. I could have left at any time before \nthat, but for some reason that was the thing that broke me, and I hurried back \nto the others as quietly as I could. Sarah returned about fifteen minutes later, \nand didn’t seem to suspect she’d been observed. I lay awake the rest of that \nnight, smelling her cigarette smoke and the traces of her odd floral perfume. \nI never asked her about it. I never brought it up with the others. We got \nwhatever daylight shots of the Cambridge Military Hospital we needed almost \nin silence, though Andy kept trying to strike up a conversation. The journey \nback was no better. I kept trying to get a look at Sarah’s arm, but her jacket \nsleeves covered them completely. We dropped her off in Sydenham and I \nnever saw her again. \nIn the end it was actually Toni that asked we not work with Sarah Baldwin \nagain. Apparently she’d gotten “weird vibes” and didn’t feel comfortable \naround her. I agreed, though I didn’t share my reasons. The episode came out \nokay, in the end though, um, though I didn’t include anything about what I saw \nthat night. \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nInteresting. You say you recorded video of the event? \n \nMELANIE \nYeah, I’ve given your guys a copy, but watching it back the recording is so \ndistorted that you can’t really make anything out. \n \nJONATHAN SIMS", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 5, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 4129}}
