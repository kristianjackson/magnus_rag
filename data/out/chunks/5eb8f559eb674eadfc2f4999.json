Original statement given June 23rd 2013. Audio \nrecording by Jonathan Sims, Head Archivist of the Magnus Institute, London. \nStatement begins. \nARCHIVIST (STATEMENT) \nI try not to judge on appearances. I have a certain sympathy with those who \nfind themselves instinctively reviled by those about them. Not simply because \nI, myself, am what you might generously describe as odd-looking, but because \nmy career has taken me down the path of working for the Inland Revenue. And \nyou should see the way people recoil from you when they find out you work \nfor the taxman. So I try to have a little bit more depth than that and give \neveryone a chance. So it was with what could be described as an aggressively \nopen mind that I made my way to undertake an inspection of The Trophy \nRoom, a taxidermist’s shop near Woodside Park in Barnet. \nI have never been in any way attracted to the idea of taxidermy, aside from a \nfew interesting examples in the Natural History Museum, but I was quite \ncertain it didn’t deserve its ghoulish reputation. Of course, I was inspecting it \nto ensure it wasn’t being used for money laundering purposes, so if it turned \nout it was involved in criminal activity, I would be quite justified in any bad \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 054 – Still Life \n3 \n \nopinion I might care to indulge, but I didn’t want to be premature. You see, The \nTrophy Room had been a staple of Woodside Park for some 30 years, but like \nmany niche-interest shops, seemed to see little real business. \nIts taxes were all in order, but there were very few regular customers and most \nof the money that kept it in the black came from occasional large transactions \nthat seemed somewhat excessive for the items being purchased – all hallmarks \nof money laundering. You’d be surprised how many businesses that you pass \nevery day on the street are being used in a similar manner. Those shops that \nnever seem to be open, or who cater to such a specific market you wonder \nhow they can break even, well, often they can’t without some illicit assistance. \nNow, I’m not the police. I have no power to arrest anyone, revoke any licences \nor even issue a fine without a good deal of hassle. That all comes later and \nfrom other people. My job is just to discuss their compliances and policies to \nprevent money laundering, and examine their transactions to confirm that \nthey’re not too suspect. I find it fascinating, but I am keenly aware that the \nmajority of the people I inspect do not share my opinion. \nAs soon as I arrived at The Trophy Room, I could tell that it was going to take \nsome time. The shop had that layer of grime that only accumulates after a \nbusiness has been in place for decades without change.
