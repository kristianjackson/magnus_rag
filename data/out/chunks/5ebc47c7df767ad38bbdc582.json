We are trying. Daisy, Basira and I, we don’t leave the \nInstitute much anymore, so we do spend a lot of time together. It’s not that \neasy though. When everyone has so many walls, so many defences, sometimes \nyou can feel lonely even when you’re all in the same room. But it’s better than \nthe alternative, and at least none of us are suffering alone. Martin’s got it the \nworst of course, but it still seems to be his choice, and I have to trust that he \nknows what he’s doing. \nStill feeling week. Restless. I want to be proactive, but that hasn’t … (Sighs) \nThat hasn’t been going quite so well for us lately. \nOh, uh… \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 150 – Cul-de-Sac \n \n11 \n \nCoe in, Melanie! \n[Door opens] \nMELANIE \nJohn, have you got a moment? \nARCHIVIST \nUh, course, I was just, um, having a statement. \nMELANIE \nOh ... A-an old one? \nARCHIVIST \nWha— Yes, an old one! I’m not— I’m doing my best. \nMELANIE \nSure. \nARCHIVIST \nWhat do you want? \nMELANIE \nUh, I just wanted to talk to you about, well, um, my... ‘career,’ I guess? My \nposition in the Archives. \nARCHIVIST \nI see ... \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 150 – Cul-de-Sac \n \n12 \n \nMELANIE \nLook, I’m not going to do my job anymore. \nARCHIVIST \nI’m not sure I follow. You know we can’t quit. We’ve all tried. \nMELANIE \nI didn’t say I was going to quit. I said I’m not going to do my job: no \nresearching, no filing, no field trips, nothing that is going to help the Institute in \nany way. I’ll still be around, I just ... I can’t be a part of this anymore. If I get \nsick, I get sick, and if I die ... \nARCHIVIST \nWhy? \nMELANIE \nBecause this place is evil, John. And so, doing this job, helping it out, even in \nsmall ways, is in some ways evil tool. Every time we try to use it to do good, it \njust seems to make everything worse. And ... And I will not be a part of that \nanymore. \nARCHIVIST \nWhat about the Unknowing? W-we saved the world. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 150 – Cul-de-Sac \n \n13 \n \nMELANIE \nDid we? I-I mean, I think it was the right thing to do, but how many people \nwere killed to do it? W-we weren’t even a neutral party. We did it as agents of \nThe Eye, because Elias told us to. \nARCHIVIST \nA-and then you put him in jail. \nMELANIE \nMartin put him there. A-and he’s still doing harm! You ever think that maybe \nthis whole ritual business is just an excuse, and that we’re all just part of some \nhuge, miserable fear machine? \nARCHIVIST \nI’ve... considered the possibility. \nMELANIE \nRight, well, if I’m just another cog, maybe I can’t leave the machine, but from \nthis moment, I’m not turning. I’m jammed. \nARCHIVIST \nDid your therapist suggest this? \nMELANIE \nN-not exactly. She’s just helped me work through some things I’ve been \nthinking for a while. She doesn’t know the details, just that I’m in a bad \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 150 – Cul-de-Sac \n \n14 \n \ncontract situation working somewhere pretty awful. She thinks I work for the \nTories. \nARCHIVIST \nMelanie, could you ... Could you describe your therapist for me? \nMELANIE \nWhat? You think I wouldn’t notice if she had cobwebs down her face? \nARCHIVIST \nNo. \nMELANIE \nThat’s it, isn’t it? You really think I’m so stupid I wouldn’t have noticed if my \ntherapist was some kind of monster? \nARCHIVIST \nI just... It was a worry. \nMELANIE \nRight, right, okay. I know. That is why I ruined my first four sessions and almost \ntorpedoed the chance at a genuinely really good therapist, because I was so \nparanoid that she was going to turn out to be some … something trying to \nmanipulate me. But no. She’s not full of spiders, or made of wax, or wearing \nthe therapist’s skin or whatever. She’s just a well-trained professional, who I \nam paying to help me.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 6, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 3747}}
