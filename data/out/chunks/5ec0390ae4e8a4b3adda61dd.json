Details pulled \ndirectly from subject. \n \nStatement begins. \n \nThe Archivist does not know where he is, and in many ways that is correct, for \nto say that he was anywhere would be an error. He has no conception of his \nbody, lying on that grey hospital bed, perplexing the doctors: heart unbeating, \nlungs unmoving, but mind and nerves alive and firing wildly. Everything but \nbraindead. But he is where he exists so often when his eyes are closed. He \nwanders the dreams he was given. \n \nA cold and well-cleaned room, sterile metal tables that overflow with a gentle \ntrickle of blood. The hearts that beat upon them spasm and spurt without any \nsort of rhythm, and were they to stand still for but a moment, it might become \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG120 – Eye Contact \n \n2 \n \nclear just how wrong they are in their construction. There are no strange \nfigures standing over those tables, no mockeries of earnest learning, but in the \ncentre stands a weeping, bearded man in a lab coat. In his thin, vinyl-gloved \nhands he holds an apple, though he dearly wishes otherwise. \n \nThe doctor cannot bring himself to look at the tables, so instead looks to the \nArchivist, whose eye watches him and cannot close. He tries to scream, to \ncurse at the Archivist, pleading to him for peace, for rest. The Archivist watches \nas the blood creeps along the tiled floor and pools at the doctor’s feet. \nDesperate, he tries to throw the apple at his observer, but it is too late; the \ndoctor has forgotten how the elbows work and wrenches it to the side with a \nsickening crack. He tries again to scream, but he hasn’t got the throat right, \nand the wheezing, half-choked gurgle that escapes would stir pity in the \nArchivist if he had not heard it so many times before. \n \nThe Archivist waits, expecting to awaken, but there is nowhere for him to \nawaken to, no avenue of escape from these dreams. He turns to see the \nfamiliar screen, the familiar woman beneath it. She looks up at him with an \nexpression of recognition and weary dread. She types and types and types, her \nfingers a blur flying across the keyboard and yet never fast enough to outrun \nthe relentless words that flow like dark water across the screen that stretches \noff into the sky: IT HURTS. She is shaking her head, defiant in her well-worn \nterror, and tries with every corner of her will to force back the rolling tide of \nwords: IT HURTS. Her fingers are still; her hands raise to her mind, trying to \nthink, trying to comprehend: IT HURTS.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 0, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 2922}}
