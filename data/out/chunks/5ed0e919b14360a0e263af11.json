The Magnus Archives. Episode one hundred and \nseventy-three: \"Night Night.\" \n[Theme finishes] \n[Tape clicks on] \n[The sound of night birds call regularly; there is the rusty squeak of \noutdoor swing sets every so often] \n[Martin and the Archivist walk on pavement] \nMARTIN \nSlow down, I can barely see a thing! \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 173 – Night Night \n2 \nARCHIVIST \nSorry. \nMARTIN \n(Flippant) No prizes for guessing who's in charge here, eh? \nARCHIVIST \nMm, I-I suppose not. \nMARTIN \nYou know, I really miss the days when I could blame broken streetlights on the \ncouncil. A strongly-worded letter just doesn't feel as forceful when it's \naddressed to (funny voice, pitched lower) whichever Dread Power it may \nconcern. \nARCHIVIST \nMm. \nMARTIN \nJohn? \nARCHIVIST \n(Distracted) Hm? \nMARTIN \n(Concerned) John, are you alright? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 173 – Night Night \n3 \nARCHIVIST \nUh, I, I— \nMARTIN \nI mean, like, comparatively. \nARCHIVIST \n…I'm fine. \nMARTIN \nHuh! Nope. Try again! \nARCHIVIST \nLook, I would just really like to get through here as quickly as possible. \nMARTIN \nHow come? This one seems like the quietest place we've been in a while, it's \njust rows and rows of quiet houses. I mean, I know some people don't like that \nsort of thing, but I'm actually (slight laugh) finding it kind of relaxing— \nARCHIVIST \n(Interrupting) (distressed) Martin. Please. \n(The Archivist’s breaths are shallow and nervous) \nMARTIN \n...John? Where are we? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 173 – Night Night \n4 \nARCHIVIST \nI-it's complicated. \nMARTIN \nThat's, not an answer. \nARCHIVIST \nCan we please just move on? \n[In the distance, a long, high scream from a child] \n[Martin makes a small gasp and turns] \n[They stop walking] \nMARTIN \nJohn, where have you brought us? \n(Beat) \nARCHIVIST \nWhat do you think happened to all the children when the world changed? Or \nwere you not thinking about it? \nMARTIN \n(Softly) No... \nARCHIVIST \nBecause they didn't just vanish. Childish fears are... simplistic. Direct. \n(As he speaks, Martin reacts and sighs) \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 173 – Night Night \n5 \nThe Eye prefers the more complex neuroses and disquiets of a fully developed \nmind. So the children are allowed to age, and they are placed in domains \nwhere their fears can... mature. \nDomains like this one. \nMARTIN \nChrist, that's… that's messed up! \nARCHIVIST \nYes. \nMARTIN \nWe've got to help them. \nARCHIVIST \nHow? \nMARTIN \n(Agitated) I, I don't know! I-I'm not the one who's supposed to know \neverything, alright? There has to be something we can do! \n[Another child screams in the distance] \nMARTIN \nWhat's happening to them? \nARCHIVIST \nDo you really want to know that? Really? I've been trying very hard to keep this \none bottled up. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 173 – Night Night \n6 \n(Martin sighs as the Archivist speaks) \nMARTIN \n(Inflamed, serious) Wh-what about the avatar? Alright, I know you said it \ndidn't change anything, the-the domain would still exist, but at this point I \ndon't care, alright? Anyone who's chosen to spend their apocalypse tormenting \nchildren— God, y-you need to end them. Now. \nARCHIVIST \nIt's not that simple. \nMARTIN \nSeriously? Seriously? \n(The Archivist lets out a heavy sigh) \nARCHIVIST \nFine. \n[The backpack zippers jangle as they start walking] \nMARTIN \nOkay, good. \n(Beat) \nWhere are we going? \n(Beat) \nJohn? \n[The Archivist rings a doorbell] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 173 – Night Night \n7 \nMARTIN \nJohn, wait, a-are you, are you sure?— \n[The door squeaks as a young teenage boy opens it] \nCALLUM BRODIE \nYeah? What is it? \nARCHIVIST \nCallum Brodie? \nCALLUM \n(Lower) Yeah? \nMARTIN \nWait, is this..? \nARCHIVIST \nAre your parents home? \nCALLUM \nDad's dead. Mum's here, but she lost it a while back. So now it's just me. \nARCHIVIST \nDo you know who I am? \nCALLUM \nYou're the Eye guy, right?", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 0, "chunk_count": 5, "chars": 4188}}
