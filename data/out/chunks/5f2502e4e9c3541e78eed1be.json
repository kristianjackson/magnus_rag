Setting \ntraps, putting down poison boxes, the usual. Residential homes don’t call me \nout quite so much for rats and mice, especially if it’s a rental place. Most \nlandlords don’t bother paying out for that sort of thing or try to deal with it \nthemselves. You get a lot of calls about bedbugs though. Those little bastards \nare a devil to get rid of, and of course, come summer, we have to deal with \nplenty of wasps’ nests. Sprinkle a generous handful of cockroaches, ants and \noccasionally even birds or foxes, and you have a pretty good idea of what my \nworking life consists of. Pretty normal. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 055 – Pest Control \n \n6 \n \nI got my first weird call about five years ago. It was ants, or so I was told, down \nin Bromley. The house itself looked like a pretty standard suburban home – \nmaybe a bit more rundown than its neighbours, but nothing particularly \nunusual about that, especially if they were calling me in. There was no car in \nthe driveway and the blinds were all drawn, despite the summer sun. It didn’t \nlook like there was anyone home. I found out later that it had actually been \none of the neighbours that called me in, a woman named Laura Starr, but at \nthat point I was still expecting to be met by someone at the house. I knocked \non the door, but obviously there was no answer. Now, I always wear gloves \nwhen I’m on the job and, when I noticed my hand, I noticed a very faint sheen \nwhere the thin leather had touched the wood. It seemed to be some sort of \noily residue. I was feeling less comfortable with the job by the second. \nI couldn’t hear anything from inside, so I knocked again. The woman who hired \nme had said to let myself in, but I didn’t want to just waltz in unannounced. \nAfter a few seconds of silence, I tried the handle and, sure enough, the door \nopened. There were no lights on the inside and the place seemed almost \ncompletely empty of furniture. I could see faint movement on the wooden \nfloor as I looked around for the light switch. I found it quickly enough and \nflicked it on to reveal exactly what I’d expected. Ants. I just hadn’t expected \nthat many. And there were so very many of them. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 055 – Pest Control \n \n7 \n \nTo this day, I’ve never seen more ants inside a building at once. There must \nhave been thousands, carpeting the floor and swarming over the walls. I drew \nmy hand back from the light switch as I noticed dozens of them crawling \naround it. Even the bulb seemed to be covered with them, causing the light in \nthe room to be covered with twitching shadow. The house itself didn’t look \nmuch better. Wherever there was a gap in the ants, I could see that same oily \nrot and I couldn’t escape the idea that the building was somehow sick. \nNow, I’ve seen plenty of disgusting things in this job, but I reckon that moment \nwas one of the most intense. I fled briefly back to my van to decide on my next \nmove. Normally I’d leave out some poisoned bait for them to take back to their \ncolony, eliminating the problem at its source, but an infestation that bad, well, \nthat doesn’t come from nothing. I needed to get a sense of exactly what I was \ndealing with. Even from the road, I could see a steady stream flowing out the \nopen door and over the step. \nI kitted up with pesticide spray and headed in for a closer look. I wouldn’t \nnormally bother using spray on ants, but this wasn’t normal and the formula I \nwas using worked on ants just fine. That said, I didn’t actually see any of them \ndie. I wouldn’t have expected to immediately anyway, and what was important \nis that wherever I sprayed, they fled, clearing a path of discoloured floor for me \nto walk. It was slow going, but I got through most of the ground floor like that", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 1, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 3864}}
