There was no sign of fatigue in her eyes, \nand I couldn’t help but wonder if she’d been asleep at all. Or maybe just lying \nvery, very still. I tried not to think about it as I crawled into my sleeping bag on \nthe cold hospital floor, and the last thing I heard before I drifted off was the \nclick of Sarah Baldwin’s lighter. \nI woke up about an hour later. I don’t know what woke me, but the others \nwere all still asleep. I realised that I couldn’t smell cigarettes, and looking \naround it appeared Sarah had wandered off. It was almost pitch dark, with only \na small amount of moonlight creeping in through the boarded windows. I \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG028 – Skin Tight \n10 \n \nturned on a torch and checked the readings. There were no spikes in EMF, but \nit looked like the temperature had dropped sharply about 10 minutes before. I \nwaited for another five minutes, but when Sarah still hadn’t returned I started \nto get a bit worried. \nI should have woken the others, but if it turned out she’d just gone to the \nbathroom, I didn’t want to embarrass her in front of everyone.

Instead, I took one of \nthe cameras we weren’t using and turned on the night vision setting. Through \nthe viewscreen I was able to see where I was going pretty well. \nI started to check the ground floor. The night vision cast everything into stark \nshapes, and every time I turned the corner it seemed like there was something \nthere, just beyond the range of the camera. I couldn’t see or hear anything, but \nit was just there. I could feel it. There was a smell as well, growing stronger. It \nwasn’t cigarette smoke, though, or Sarah’s strange perfume. It smelled of \ncopper, with another scent beneath it, acrid and sour, with the faintest hint of \nammonia. I’ll, I’ll admit it, I was scared. Scared enough that I didn’t even think \nabout how great the whole thing would have looked in our show. I didn’t look \ninto the camera, or provide any commentary, or make any move except \nkeeping a close watch on the display. \nAs I walked up the stairs towards the upper floor, I began to hear something.
