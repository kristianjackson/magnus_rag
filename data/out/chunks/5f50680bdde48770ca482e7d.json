I mainly take care of the science labs. \nMost of the cleaning crews at the university get shifted around a lot, working \nin different buildings or departments one month to the next, but there’s a lot \nof stuff in the labs that requires additional training to clean safely, so we’re a \nbit more specialised than the rest. I mean, they still didn’t let us within spitting \ndistance of the really expensive equipment; that was all taken care of by the \nlab techs, but the point is I’m a much more familiar face around the science \ndepartments than a cleaner would otherwise be. There’s also the fact that the \nscience lot actually talked to me on occasion. I don’t want to say it’s ‘cause I’m \n\nwhite and the rest of the cleaning crew isn’t, but they always talked to me in a \nway they didn’t talk to the others, so I became the de facto point of contact \nbetween the cleaners and the rest of the staff. \nLong story short, I generally knew roughly what the deal was with most of the \nexperiments being run at any point. \nSo, when Dr Elizabeth Bates told me about the latest study by her psychology \npostgrads, I thought she was pulling my leg. The Psych Department is generally \none of the least demanding from my perspective as it’s almost entirely people \nsitting at computers or in interview rooms. Once or twice I think they were \ngiven use of an MRI machine at some hospital or other but that’s more a \nneuroscience thing and, more importantly, didn’t happen in the buildings I \ncleaned. Since I’ve been there, which is a good seven years now, they’ve never \ncrossed over into parapsychology, nothing even remotely less than respectable \nresearch, so when Liz explained the experiment and I realised they were \nbasically doing ESP research, I got a bit excited. I mean, she dressed it up with \nall sorts of science jargon and sent my head spinning plenty, but it still basically \nboiled down to seeing if the thoughts and feelings of a group of people in one \nroom had any effect on the experience of a subject in a separate, sealed room. \nI mean she could talk about “group dynamics” and call it “proximity intuition” \nor whatever it was she said, but I know ESP research when I’m mopping its \nfloors. Not that I minded, of course; I love that crap. I’m a horror nut but I \ngenerally tend toward the more sci-fi end. Demons and ghosts have never \nreally got me but give me aliens or the sinister powers of the human mind and \nI am there. I didn’t tell any of this to Liz, of course, I got the impression that it \nwas a bit of a sore spot and I’ve no reason to piss off the people I work with. \nBut you can be damn sure I was keeping a much closer eye on this experiment \n\nthan I was the others. Especially when she told me a bit more about how they \nwere doing it. \nThe basic premise was pretty similar to most of these studies. There was a \nroom with a one-way mirror where the subject would sit, and they’d be \nstrapped up to measure physical responses. The other side of the glass was \nanywhere between one and twenty participants, who would be receiving \nstimulus for a certain response or feeling. Those feelings would be incited \nwhile their attention was on the subject through the mirror. Then they simply \nmeasured what, if any, response the subject had to something they couldn’t \nsee, hear or otherwise be aware of. Sometimes the subject was told there \nwere people on the other side of the glass when there weren’t, in order to get \na control group and weed out any placebo responses. \nThe subject’s name was Annabelle Cane. \nWhat really got me, though, was what Liz told me about the specific nature of \nthe feelings they were trying to project. \nThey were planning to work with fear. \nSpecifically, they had selected as projectors a group of people who self-\nidentified as arachnophobes, and at certain points of their watching Annabelle, \nvideos of spiders crawling, eating and spawning would be randomly projected \nover the glass, inciting an acute fear response. \nThe reasoning was that fear was both an extremely powerful emotion and one \nthat would be quite easy to distinguish in Annabelle’s responses. They wanted \nto see if they could use ESP to scare her. I told you it sounded like a set-up to a \nhorror movie, right? I don’t know how they didn’t see that. I mean, maybe they \ndid. Maybe they went ahead with it for the same reason I joked with Laura", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 1, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 4386}}
