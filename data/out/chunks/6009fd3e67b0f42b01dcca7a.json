My leg \nwas starting to cramp up, so I tried to shift position, but I didn’t realise just \nhow painful it would be to move, and I let out a cry before I had a chance to \nstifle it. The driver’s head snapped up and focused on me. He was rail thin, \ndressed in rough overalls, with shaggy black hair and pale skin. He was East \nAsian, Chinese, maybe, but he called me over in a crisp British accent. His tone \nwas firm, but unhurried, and to my ears, not immediately threatening. So, I did \nas he asked. I walked slowly but deliberately over to him, hands out to my side, \ndoing my best to show him I wasn’t a threat. I made the decision that, \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 130 – Meat \n8 \n \nwhatever was happening, my best chance to make it out was to just keep \ndoing as I was asked. \nBy the time I reached the truck, the smell was so thick I could taste it. I stood \nthere, legs shaking, muttering a prayer to a god I didn’t even believe in. He \nstared at me for what felt like hours, but it can’t have been longer than a few \nseconds. Then he shrugged, turned to the truck, and picked up what looked \nlike the back half of a goat. He held it out to me expectantly. Honestly, I was so \nsurprised that I just took it on instinct. The driver nodded to himself, like he’d \nmade the right decision, and I turned and started to walk towards the door, \nafraid that any hesitation might make him reconsider, might mark me out as \nsomething other than whatever he had decided I was. I don’t eat much meat, \nand rarely ever cook it myself, but I held that cold haunch to me like a \ntalisman, as if it might ward away whatever awful thing waited inside that \ndoor. \nAs I got closer, I saw one of the others, a tall, gangly woman with arms that \nbent backwards, leaving the entrance. She had to stoop to get through, but as \nshe raised back up to her full height, I felt her eyes rest on me for a second. I \ndidn’t slow my pace or meet her gaze. She walked past me quickly, on the way \nback to the truck for her next load. I stepped through the entrance, moving \ncarefully down what looked to be a rough-hewn stone stairway. It went deeper \nand deeper, far below where any normal basement might have been, so \nnarrow at points that I had trouble fitting. My mind kept trying to imagine \nmeeting one of the less human-looking things coming back up the other way, \nbut I didn’t let it. Finally, I reached the bottom and stepped out into a scene I \nstill see every time I close my eyes. \n \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 130 – Meat \n9 \n \nI don’t know how big the room would have been to begin with. Only one side \nhad anything that might have once been considered an interior wall. The \nothers were rough rock and stone, clearly hollowed out and extended until the \nplace must have been almost forty yards across. In the middle of the floor, \ntaking up almost the entirety of this strange vault, was a pit. No, not a pit, not \nexactly. The others stood around the edge throwing their burdens down into it \none piece at a time. And there, at the bottom, was another pile, one that \ndwarfed the truck outside. One that would have dwarfed a hundred trucks, \nbecause I couldn’t actually see the bottom. For all I know, it could have gone \ndown forever, an endless pillar of flesh. But then it moved, and I realised in a \nsecond what it actually was I was looking at: not a pit, a mouth. \nI feel a strange, deep pride that I didn’t scream. I didn’t panic, though my mind \nfelt like it was trying to shut down at the repulsive sight. Instead, I forced \nmyself to take my place, there at the edge, and hurl my offering down into it. It \naccepted it greedily. \nI wish I could say I ran, then, or that I found a clever trick to escape. But I \ndidn’t. When I returned to the surface, I was handed more meat before I had a \nchance to even consider getting away. So I decided I would keep up the ruse \nuntil the truck was empty, in the hopes I’d have a chance later. But as we \nunloaded the last of the grim cargo, and I carried a heavy, red tongue down \ninto the vault, I saw another truck pull up, almost identical to the first. Then \nanother. Then another. There was no end to them. \nDay turned into night, turned into day again, and still I carried meat and threw \nit into the hole. My back was screaming, my legs were weak, and my mind was \nnumb from terror, but I was spurred on by one thing.
