The Magnus Archives. Episode one hundred and eighty-\nthree: \"Monument.\" \n[Theme finishes] \n[Tape clicks on] \n[A wasteland wind swirls, while in the distance is the faint sound \nslow stone grinding and metal groans] \n[Feet shuffle to turn on a gritty surface] \nMARTIN \nOh bugger off! \nARCHIVIST \nEverything alright? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 183 – Monument \n2 \nMARTIN \nOh, no, w-w-what even is that? I-It’s like Escher ate a bad cathedral and threw \nup everywhere. \nARCHIVIST \nIt’s a building. A tower, in a sense. \nMARTIN \nOh yeah? And what sense might that be? \nARCHIVIST \n(Faintly ominous) The Tarot sense. \n(Martin splutters with laughter) \nMARTIN \nReally? \nARCHIVIST \nWhat? No. Sorry, it… felt like a good line. \nMARTIN \nNo, no, it was. I just… I dunno, I… you did the look and… It’s fine, sorry. \nWhat, what’s the deal, though? Parts of it almost look like— \nARCHIVIST \nThe Institute. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 183 – Monument \n3 \nMARTIN \nYeah. \nARCHIVIST \nYes. \nIt makes sense. After all, it was built on the ruins of what Robert Smirke \nconstructed. \nMARTIN \nSmirke? \n…What? No. But, but, surely he’s— \nARCHIVIST \nDead? Yeah I mean yes. Very much so. This place is... an homage, shall we say. \nA monument. To him and those like him, who tried to… categorise the world \nwith themselves at the centre. In so doing, constructed the architecture of its \nsuffering. \nMARTIN \nBit of a mouthful. \nARCHIVIST \nWould you prefer I described it as a …cascading recursion of shifting arrogance \nand hubristic dead-ends? \n[Door opens and footsteps] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 183 – Monument \n4 \nHELEN \nI would. \n[Hissing static rises and falls with Helen’s entrance] \n[A high-pitched tone starts] \n[Door shuts] \nMARTIN \n(Weary) Hello Helen. Might have guessed you’d be into weird architecture. \nVery much your area of expertise, no? \nHELEN \nHmm, depends. Would you describe ‘petulant poet’ as your area of expertise? I \nam weird architecture. Anyway where have you been? I’ve been looking for \nyou but you both just vanished. \nARCHIVIST \n(Realising to himself) Ah. Right. I see. \nHELEN \nI was so looking forward to catching up after that whole Basira and Daisy thing, \nbut then pfft! You both disappear. I’d be very keen to know how you managed \nthat little trick. \nMARTIN \nWhy, it caught us by surprise too. I mean, w-we actually we ended— \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 183 – Monument \n5 \nARCHIVIST \n (Firmly) We found somewhere to rest. That’s all. \nMARTIN \nOh, yeah. Ah. Yes. Hm. \nHELEN \nFine. Be like that. I can appreciate the particular pleasure of a kept secret. \nARCHIVIST \nI’m sure you can. \nHELEN \nAnyway, such a shame about Basira and Daisy. I was really rooting for them to \nmake up. \nMARTIN \n(Splutters) Since when? What happened to— I mean, how did you put it, ah… \n“A quick shot to the back of the head, and then back in time for tea”, or \nwhatever? \n(Helen gives an exasperated sigh) \nHELEN \nOh give over. I was obviously just prodding her, trying to make a point. She \ndidn’t want to kill her. \nARCHIVIST \nWhat we want doesn’t matter much these days. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 183 – Monument \n6 \nHELEN \nOh- (raspberry noise) \nNonsense. What we want is the only thing that matters these days. And Basira \nwanted to join Daisy. \nARCHIVIST \nShe made her choice. \nHELEN \nWith your assistance. \nARCHIVIST \nIt was still her choice. \nHELEN \n(Sighing) What a waste. \nARCHIVIST \nNo. \nIt wasn’t. \nMARTIN \nBasira is... \nShe’s going to be okay. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 183 – Monument \n7 \nHELEN \nOh, is she? Do you want me to tell you what she’s been up to while you were \n‘resting’? Where she is right now? \nARCHIVIST \nYou don’t need to. I already know. \nMARTIN \nI don’t. \n[Faint hissing static starts] \nARCHIVIST \nShe’s currently moving through the, “The Void.” Hungry shadows drifting in the \ndark. \n[Faint hissing static ends] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nShe’s been there a long time, now, struggling to find the path. \nMARTIN \nBut she will. \nARCHIVIST \nI think so.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 0, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 4345}}
