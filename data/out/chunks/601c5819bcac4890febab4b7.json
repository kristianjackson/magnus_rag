I outbid him at an auction. It was nothing of note, so I \nassumed, though perhaps I should have considered his particular obsession. It \nwas an oilskin packet of documents, supposedly from the log-books of \nFranklin’s lost ship, the HMS Terror. I will admit a small amount of interest in \nthe matter myself, and my inclination turned to resolve when I saw how \ninsistently Rayner was bidding on it, and I prevailed. He approached me \nafterwards to discuss the matter and, perhaps if his tone had been less sharp, I \n\nmight have allowed him to observe the documents himself, but as it was I took \nsome issue with his manner of address and curtly denied him. He was almost \nshaking with rage at this point, and I was momentarily concerned that the \nsituation might descend into violence when, instead, he leaned forward and \nwhispered with an intensity I had never before heard in a human voice: “Pray \nthe Sandman only brings you sleep.” \nNow, the fact that these words filled me with a stark terror that all but \novercame my senses probably needs some explanation. My father was not a \nkindly man, you see. He came from a stern Christian tradition that would \ncurdle the smiles of the simpering vicars you encounter these days. As a boy, I \nsoon learned that the key to avoiding his ire was to avoid his attention \naltogether, and never more so than after I had been put to bed. The nursery, \nyou see, had its door in the middle of the passage between the drawing room \nand my father’s study and, as such, he would pass by it several times a night. \nWhen I heard that heavy tread outside the door and the shadow passing over \nthe threshold, I would lie there and pray that I was quiet enough not to disturb \nhis passage. If I was ever foolish enough to leave my candle burning that I \nmight read a few minutes more, I would hear the door open and my father’s \nvoice intone, “Lights out.” He had been a military man in his youth, had my \nfather, and he prided himself on handing down that discipline to me. \nEventually I was sent off to board at Repton School, up near Manchester. The \nHeadmaster there, one John Heyrick Macaulay, was apparently an old friend of \nmy father’s. It was a miserable place: over two centuries old and very much \nshowing it. When I attended there must have been barely fifty boys there, and \nno cricket pitch, racquet court, or any of the sort of facilities one might have \nexpected, nor even a chapel. The few masters there taught Latin and Greek \nreadily enough, but no French or music or natural science. Were it not for the \nrelative freedom we had to rove around the nearby land and towns, I would \nhave had a solidly miserable time there. Even when we managed to play \nfootball, it was between crumbling arches, loomed over by the jagged shadows \nof broken pillars. For all the life and vitality of the boys there, the place itself \nwas decrepit, and sometimes I feel it resented our presence. \nI had one great friend during my time at Repton, a lad named George Denman. \nI’m sure you recognise the name, given the recent speeches he’s been giving", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 2, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 3265}}
