Had I just been sitting there in my smoking car all that \ntime? \nIt didn’t matter. The rain was beating down hard, and I needed to get some \nhelp. I tried to call the emergency services or use the GPS on my phone, but \nthe screen just said “NO SERVICE”. I took a deep breath, trying to stifle panic, \nand got out the car. I was soaked through in less than ten seconds, as I \nstruggled through the downpour towards the road. I could hear no sound \nexcept for the howling wind, and there were no headlights anywhere to be \nseen. Having no idea where I was, I made the decision to turn right and began \nto walk. I tried to use my phone again, but as I reached into my bag I realised \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG013 – Alone \n10 \n \nhow much of the rain had soaked through. Pressing the power button only \nconfirmed what I already suspected – my phone wasn’t working. Anger washed \nover me, and all the bitterness and rage that had been building over the worst \ndays of my life surged of me and I threw the useless lump of plastic at the \nground. The corner shattered as it hit the road, then it bounced off the side \nand disappeared into the thick mud. \nI suddenly felt very cold as I stood there in the road. Rain beating down, tears \nflowing freely, and utterly alone. I kept walking, desperately hoping to see \nheadlights in the distance, but there was nothing but darkness and the steady \npounding of the rain on miles of empty countryside in every direction. I didn’t \nhave a watch, so without my phone I have no idea how long I walked. The cold \nbit into my soaked funeral clothes and I shivered, falling to my knees and just \nabout giving up. No cars were coming, and I didn’t have the first clue where I \nwas going. \nIt was then I noticed that the rain had stopped. Wiping the tears from my eyes \nI saw that a fog had gathered around me, and I could no longer see more than \na few feet in front of me. I kept walking, though, as the clinging mist made me \nfeel somehow even colder. The fog seemed to follow me as went and seemed \nto swirl around with a strange, deliberate motion. You’ll probably think me an \nidiot, but it felt almost malicious. I don’t know what it wanted, but somehow I \nwas sure it wanted something. There was no presence to it, though, it wasn’t \nas though another person was there, it was… It made me feel utterly forsaken. \nI started to run, following as much of the road as I could see in the hopes of \ngetting to the other side, but there seemed to be end to it. \nI don’t know exactly when the hard tarmac of the road became dirt and grass, \nbut I realised after a few minutes that I had strayed off the path. I tried to \nbacktrack, but it was gone. All that remained was the fog and the skeletal \noutlines of half-glimpsed trees. The dark lines of them bent away from me at \nharsh angles, but if I tried to approach them then, rather than becoming \nclearer, the trees would disappear back into the hazy night and I would lose \nthem. Kneeling down, I was surprised to realise that the ground I was now \nstanding on was not wet. The hard-packed earth was damp from the creeping \nmist but it did not appear to have been rained on. The despair I felt was quickly \nturning into fear, and I kept moving forward, further into the fog. \nI realised afterwards that the night should have been far too dark to see the \nfog.
