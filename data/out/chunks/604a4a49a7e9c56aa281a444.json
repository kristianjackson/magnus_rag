It’s old. \nARCHIVIST \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 065 – Binary \n2 \n \nI get that a lot. \nTESSA \nI just mean, I’ve been thinking. About analogue and digital. What we mean by \nthem. \nARCHIVIST \nIn terms of information, or...? \nTESSA \nYeah. We use the word ‘digital’ to refer to one specific way of storing \ninformation – discrete signal values interpreted at pre-established levels. \nAnalogue is just a fancy way of saying everything else. \nARCHIVIST \nI... \nTESSA \nAlmost everything in the world is analogue, but we’re obsessed with digital. \nWe try to render everything into it, break the world down and turn it into as \nmuch binary as it takes. But it’s not the same. I used to work on OCR programs \n– teaching computers to read, to take the messy physicality of the written \nword and convert it into something that a computer can understand in a digital \nformat. \nARCHIVIST \nI’m not sure what this has to do with my tape recorder. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 065 – Binary \n3 \n \nTESSA \nMagnetic tape. Everyone thinks it’s analogue, but it’s digital. A lower tech \nversion than what we use now, but people forget that it was used to store \ncomputerised data for decades. Maybe it reminds people of a film reel, or, or \nmaybe nostalgia turns everything analogue. Well, people always think of digital \nas not really there, but the thing is, information is always physically present. It \ndoesn’t exist as some formless nothing. Even within the tiniest, most advanced \nstorage systems, physical memory cells change and alter themselves to render \nthat information in a language all of their own. But I suppose it isn’t language, \nnot really, because, because language, as we use it, is about as far from digital \nas you can get. \nWe may call them words, but the units of data that a computer works with are \nby their nature discrete and definite, while the words we use are clumsy, \nvague things, always at the whim of interpretation and decay. Well, it’s an \nobvious thing to say that a computer cannot feel, but it’s true. No sequence of \ndistinct ones and zeroes can replicate the swirling cocktail of chemicals and, \nyou know, nerves, that is a human being. Or any other animal for that matter. \nOr nothing about humanity is binary. \nARCHIVIST \nRight. So, you work in computers, then? \nTESSA \nSorry, I, um... it’s been a while since I talked to someone in person. Been \nspending a lot of time in my own head. You know? Used to just dumping \ninformation when I get the chance. I have a blog actually, but I haven’t posted", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 0, "chunk_count": 9, "chars": 3135}}
