I get it. You finally get a sniff of power, and the first thing you do is \ntry to settle some old scores. \n(Martin coughs) \nPlay the big man; get off on some good old-fashioned petty revenge. \nARCHIVIST \n(Serious) I'd have thought that was a mindset you would appreciate. Now, feel \nit. All the terror and pain you've inflicted. \nJUDE \nOh, piss off— \n(She gasps) \nLook, look. Wait. Right? I'm sorry, okay? I shouldn't have burned your hand. \nARCHIVIST \nNo. You shouldn't have. \nJUDE \nPlease don't kill me, I, sure — \n(Martin coughs) \n— I moan about the Eye; who doesn't? But, we've won, both of us!
