I don’t know if any of us had any \nexpectations of what was going to happen, but unless it was some Japanese \nmilitary thing, I think we were all expecting to watch some people die. And we \ndid, I guess, just the way we thought. \nThere was a boat floating out there, not twenty yards from the shoreline. It \nwasn’t like any Imperial ship I’d ever seen, but I didn’t think it belonged to our \nside either. It was metal, but not like the warships I was used to. It was like an \nold tall ship, with tattered masts and rigging, but made entirely out of cold, \nblack iron. I knew it was cold. It made me cold just to look at it. The whole \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 137 – Nemesis \n \n5 \n \nthing shone in the moonlight, slick with water as though it had been caught in \na rainstorm, and I could see the name written in English on the prow, clear as \nanything: Nemesis. \nIt had been almost a full minute by now, and we’d still heard no response from \nthe guards. No search lights, no alarms, no angry shouting, none of the things \nthat usually accompanied any sort of commotion. That should have been a \ngood thing, right? But instead I just felt this pit in my stomach, like I knew \nwhatever was coming had to be really, really bad. Just then I saw figures \nmoving towards the shore. Even in the dark I could make out the uniforms of \nour captors, but they weren’t moving right. They were stepping slowly, walking \nto the rhythm of the drum, the swelling of the trumpet. In another life, in \nanother reality, I’d almost have said they were dancing. \nThey kept going until they stood at the water's edge. I counted dozens of \nthem. It must have been every guard in the camp, or damn near it. They were \nstill moving around each other, still shifting and stepping to the rhythm of that \nmusic, but now something was in their hands, glinting in the moonlight. Our \ncaptors held their blades tight, keeping them utterly still while their bodies \nmoved and swayed. Then in a moment the control broke, and they fell on each \nother suddenly, each crying out with unleashed ferocity. One man severed his \ncommander’s arm in a single swipe, before being run through the stomach by \nhis former comrade. Two more plunged the points into each others’ eyes, \npushing forward, driving them in until they both collapsed, propped up, \nintertwined. \nIt only took a few seconds, and then they were all dead, and the dirt was slick \nwith their blood, flowing down and into the water where the Nemesis floated. \nAnd when they were lying still and the music stopped and night was quiet \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 137 – Nemesis \n \n6 \n \nagain, that’s when I heard the sound that really chilled my blood. All my \ncomrades, my fellow prisoners, cheered. And it wasn’t the cheer of those glad \nfor freedom, it was the sound of bloodlust and cruelty. \nWithout any fear of the guards, we left our cramped dormitories and filed \ndown towards the ship that all the others seemed to think was our salvation. \nWe walked slowly, almost reverently, stepping over the bodies of our slain \njailors. A few bent down, pulling long knives and bayonets from the corpses, \nnot even bothering to wipe the trailing gore from them. Small boats paddled \nover from the ship and started to ferry us over. The sailors wore old uniforms, \na mess of different navies, different eras. Some I recognised from history \nbooks, others were a complete mystery to me. All of them had some tell-tale \nstain or burn or patch of missing cloth. Something that made it clear that \nwhoever was wearing the uniform was not the original owner. It took several \ntrips to transfer everybody to Nemesis, but in all that time, nobody spoke. It \nwas surreal. My whole time as a prisoner had felt like a nightmare, but this... \nthis felt like something else entirely. \nThey lined us all up on the deck, as if we were mustering for something. None \nof us dressed or uniformed, a few holding salvaged weapons, waiting to know \nwhat was expected of us. The ship began to sail out, down towards the open \nocean, wind and salt cutting through us as we went. My feet felt stuck to the \ndeck, shivering as we watched this weird mismatch of bloody sailors \nmanoeuvre this thing that seemed like it belonged to the bottom the sea. \nLooking around I could see the metal was twisted and bent in places, and the \nstaring closer at the deck below I began to notice rust and holes laced through \nit.
