The last thing we need is a \nletter to Elias about book burnings. \nGERARD \nLook, if you have somewhere better to burn these books, then— \nGERTRUDE \n(Joking) Of course, Gerard! I just happened not to mention the network of \nsinister tunnels that snake beneath the Archive where I keep all my darkest \nsecrets. \nGERARD \nI mean, you joke, but there could be! It’s that kinda place. \nGERTRUDE \nI rather hope I would have found them by now. I like to think I’m not a \ncomplete incompetent. \nGERARD \nUntil dementia hits. \nGERTRUDE \nGiven my choice to confide in you, I rather suspect it already has. Go burn your \nbook! \n[She flips more pages] \n(Beat) \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 162 – A Cosy Cabin \n8 \nGERARD \nGertrude? \nGERTRUDE \n(Continuing her work) Mm? \nGERARD \nWhat happens if we fail? \n[Page noises stop] \nGERTRUDE \nIn... what sense? \nGERARD \nIf we miss a ritual; you know- if one of them works. \nGERTRUDE \nBeen losing sleep, have you? \nGERARD \nYeah- something like that. \nGERTRUDE \n(Measured) If we are lucky, then that failure will also mean our deaths. \nGERARD \nYou don’t think they can reach us after death? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 162 – A Cosy Cabin \n9 \nGERTRUDE \nI suppose that depends on your religious beliefs. \n[Chair creak] \nGERTRUDE (CONT’D) \nPersonally, I suspect death puts us beyond their power, either because we find \nourselves in… some kind of afterlife, or because we simply— cease to be. \nGERARD \nYeah, I guess. \nGERTRUDE \nAnd I am certain that either scenario is preferable to lingering in a world they \ncontrol. They’re already able to circumvent physics, and suspend natural laws. \nIf one were to genuinely press through, I suspect they would rewrite them \nwholesale, most likely making them utterly incomprehensible to any survivors. \nThey-They might still need us human enough to be afraid, but beyond that... \nLet’s just surmise that petty rules like space or time would be unlikely to factor \ninto the proceedings. They might even stop death entirely, deny us the one last \nescape, keeping us alive and afraid— forever. \n(Beat) \n(Gerard exhales) \nGERARD \nAnd taxes? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 162 – A Cosy Cabin \n10 \nGERTRUDE \nHeh, taxes, I imagine, will continue. Beyond that, I honestly don’t know. I \nsuppose it depends on which one comes through. The world of the Stranger \nwould be very different to that of the Corruption. \nGERARD \nEugh. \n(Beat) \n And if it does happen— \nGERTRUDE \nIt’s my fondest ambition to make sure it does not. \nGERARD \nYeah, sure, but— suppose it does. \nGERTRUDE \n(Sigh) Very well. \nGERARD \nCould it be undone? \n (Beat) \n(Gertrude takes a breath) \n[Chair creaks] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 162 – A Cosy Cabin \n11 \nGERTRUDE \nNo. I don’t think so. Once an Entity fully manifested, I doubt it would be keen \nto fully relinquish its grip on realit— \n[Tape click] \n[In the background is the sound of strange and distant howls from \nunknown creatures, and the sound of muffled wind. Closer, wood \ncreaks regularly, as of a building settling and moving, and the \nsounds of a small log fire] \n[The sound of tape rewinding] \n[Tape click] \nGERTRUDE \nNo. I don’t think so. Once an— \n[Tape click] \n[The strange howls, wind and creaks resume] \n[The sound of tape rewinding] \n[Tape click] \nGERTRUDE \nNo. I don’t think so. \n[Tape click] \n[The strange howls, wind and creaks resume] \n[The sound of tape rewinding] \n[Tape click] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 162 – A Cosy Cabin \n12 \n \nGERTRUDE \nI don’t think so. \n[Tape click] \n[The strange howls, wind and creaks resume] \n(Beat) \n[Tape click] \nGERTRUDE \nOnce an Entity fully manifested, I doubt it would be keen to relinquish its grip \non reality. And as for those unlucky enough to survive its rule... I don’t think \nthey’d be in a state to do anything about it. \n(Gerard exhales a pfft) \nGERARD \nWell. Then I guess we’d better not let it happen. \nGERTRUDE \nWell. Quite. Now. I believe you have an evil book to burn? \nGERARD \nYeah. Of course. \n[He starts to leave] \nGERARD (CONT’D) \nYou, uh- need anything else burning?", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 1, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 4068}}
