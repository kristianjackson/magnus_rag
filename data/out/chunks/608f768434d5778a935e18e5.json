He didn’t seem alarmed or \nscared, just completely still. I was quiet for a few seconds, and then he took \nthe beer out and handed it to me, shutting the little fridge behind him. He gave \nno indication that he’d heard me. So I asked again, the pit on 6th and River, \nwhat was it’s deal? He looked at me for a while, like he was trying to puzzle out \nwhat I had said from a different language, then shrugged, and mumbled \nsomething about old roads not being properly maintained. “No,” I said, “the \npit. The big hole in the ground.” He just shook his head like I was talking \nnonsense, and headed off to his room. I tried to drink my beer, but it tasted \nthick and unpleasant on my tongue. \n\nI wanted to forget it, to ignore the dusty crater that waited in the middle of \nthis tiny town, but I couldn’t. Something about it rubbed at me, like a speck of \ndirt in my eye, but the more I tried to reach it, the deeper it went. I checked \nmaps of the area, looking to see if any of them featured the odd landmark, but \nI found ones that went right up to 2008, and none of them had anything \nmarked at that spot, even though the split in the road had clearly been there \nfar longer than a year. \nI tried to talk about it, see if anyone else had any idea about what the pit was \nor why it was there, but when I asked around Joe’s - the only diner in town - \neveryone reacted just like Tommy. \nMishearing, misunderstanding or just straight-up ignoring me. It wasn’t even \nlike they seemed deliberately evasive; all their reactions seemed genuine, but \nno-one was able to talk about the pit. \nI’d just about given up on getting anything sensible out of the people at Joe’s \nthat afternoon, when an older man walked over to me. I’d seen him around a \nbit, though I couldn’t have told you who he was or what he did. He was big, \nthough, with a face that looked chiselled out of limestone. I stopped eating, \nand waited. \nThe old man stared at me for what must have been a good twenty seconds, \nand then he spoke. \n“Nothing for you down there,” he said. “You just go and enjoy your sky.” There \nwas no mistaking the threat in his voice, as if I wasn’t going to have a lot of \ntime left to do so, and I was about to say something when his head suddenly \nsnapped forward, and he spat at my feet. Then he turned and walked away. I \nlooked down, and saw a thick brown lump of mud. Nobody looked over, and I \ndidn’t follow him. \nI actually tried to take his advice. I had other things to be worried about, and \nfundamentally there was no reason for me to be so obsessed with a hole in the \nground. It wasn’t even like I needed to travel that road. I was only regularly \ntravelling to Olympia to apply for jobs, and from Tommy’s house the pit was in \nentirely the other direction. But I started to dream about it.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 3, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 2806}}
