Mind you, the picture’s a bit out of date. \n(Jared laughs a wet, meaty laugh) \nARCHIVIST \nY-yes. \nJARED \n\nI try to kill you. And you throw me in here. And now what? You just walk in? \nARCHIVIST \nI-I didn’t— That wasn’t me. \nJARED \nYour people. Your gaff. \nARCHIVIST \nAnd you wanted to kill... me, specifically? \nJARED \nStill do. \n[Ominous shifting, cracking and popping. Throughout this conversation, \nJared’s speech is accompanied by continuous sounds of wet, mobile meat \nand bone-like clicks and snaps.] \nARCHIVIST \nRight. But… you know if you do, you're never getting out of this place. \nJARED \nWhat do you want? \nARCHIVIST \nI, uh... I want a favour. \nJARED \n\nFor letting me out? \nARCHIVIST \nYes. \nJARED \nAlright. \nARCHIVIST \nOh. O-Okay. D-Do you need to know... w-what it is? \nJARED \nNot much you could want, comin’ to me. Put summat in. Take summat out. \nWhich is it? \nARCHIVIST \nTake something out. A bone. A rib, probably. S-Something I won’t miss. \nJARED \nDone. Come ‘ere. \nARCHIVIST \nI, uh... H-How do I know you won’t just reach in and kill me? W-W-What \nguarantees do I have? \nJARED \nGuarantees? None. But I want to leave more than I want to kill you. Not like it \nwas my idea in the first place. \n\nARCHIVIST \nSo... \n(Compellingly) Why did you and the others attack us? \nJARED \nI was asked. You want my statement, that’s gonna cost you another rib. \nARCHIVIST \nI-I could just pull the information out of you. \n[Menacingly meaty murmurs] \nJARED \nYou could try. \nARCHIVIST \nOkay. Fine. A rib for me, a rib for you, your freedom and a statement. \nJARED \nYeah. Alright. \nARCHIVIST \nRight. Statement first. \nJARED \nFine. \nARCHIVIST \n\nUh. Statement of Jared Hopworth, the Boneturner. Statement begins. \n(Throaty laugh) \nJARED (STATEMENT) \nWhere do you want me to start? Growing up? My folks? How ‘bout that \ngrowth spurt when I was nine? It left me taller than all the other kids. I hated \nthem, the way they stared. But they were, and that felt good, even back then. \nIt felt right. My Dad was proud of it too. He was a short man, bully, and \nwatching me loom over people really made ‘im happy. Mum just scowled, but \nthen… huh, she always did. \nI wrecked my school. I did have friends, but they left me, one by one, until all \nthat I had were the dregs; the ones who stayed ‘coz they were too scared to \nleave. We were always either in trouble, or looking for it. Those were bad \ntimes. I tried to look ahead, but I couldn’t see anything. No future, no hope; \njust bitter parents, and whatever misery I could pass on to everyone else. God \nknows what would’ve happened if that little prick Sebastian hadn’t given me \nthat book. \nI didn’t know what it was at first, not really. But it talked to me about bones \nand flesh and muscle and blood; the bits of myself I actually knew and liked. So \nI listened, and I read, and I learned. I fumbled through the lessons the book \nwanted to teach me, and my first try was clumsy. Stupid. Turns out, Dad didn’t \nlike being tall nearly as much as he thought he would. And Mum didn’t like her \nnew smile, either. So I left. \nI wandered around for a bit. Worked a lotta jobs where it didn’t matter what \nyou looked like. There’s always a spot for someone who can get rid of people.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 2, "chunk_count": 5, "chars": 3263}}
