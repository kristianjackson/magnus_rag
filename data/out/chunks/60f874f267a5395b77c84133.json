I immediately knew that whatever fearful secrets drew me \ntowards this doctor, they would be found within that safe. \nI saw nothing of importance that day. Or the day after that, when I snuck back \ninto the same space. I haunted the cramped shadows beneath that staircase \nfor almost a week before it happened. I was always careful to be home when \nmy mother would be there, but that wasn't difficult, and Dr Tillerson never \nseemed to lock the door to her practice. I remember it was a Sunday and the \nsummer had made my hiding place almost intolerably hot. It must have been \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 062 – First Edition \n \n10 \n \nalmost as warm in the office, as the doctor took to leaving the door open \nalmost all day, allowing whatever draft might come to flow through the \nbuilding. I saw her inspect and treat almost a dozen strangers over the course \nof the morning, but still there was no hint of anything untoward. Then, shortly \nbefore she was due to close for the day, a short, matronly woman arrived. She \nhad curly brown hair, seemed to be in perfect health and smiled like a fool as \nshe made her way into Dr Tillerson's office. \nThe doctor greeted her pleasantly enough, but as the check-up began, I caught \nthe quickest glimpse of something cruel in her eyes, a certain predatory look. \nAbout ten minutes into the appointment, Dr Tillerson walked over to her \ncabinet and retrieved a small syringe. She talked amiably to her patient as she \nsterilised the vein and pushed the needle inside. She kept chatting away as the \nplunger went down. She even kept talking in that low, friendly murmur as the \nwoman with the curly brown hair began to convulse violently. Once. Twice. \nAnd then she was dead. \nAs I watched this, my heart was racing. I could lie and say what I saw made me \nafraid, but I think we both know the thrill of watching that murder inspired a \nvery different feeling within me. A dark, vicious thing that to this day I can't \nfully name. But it was beautiful and strange, though what happened next was \neven stranger. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 062 – First Edition \n \n11 \n \nDr Tillerson lifted the still warm body of her patient fully onto the table, before \ncutting through the fabric of the dress with a pair of shears, exposing an \nexpanse of skin on the woman's back. Then she opened the safe. 24-18-3-15. \nAnd then the key. I only had to watch her do it once. Inside, I saw two books, \none small and bound in leather, the other large and misshapen. As she \nretrieved the larger of the two, she brushed away what looked to be a small \npile of animal bones and picked up a wickedly sharp looking fountain pen. She \nleaned over the still form on the table and began to write, not in the book, but \non the flesh of the woman she had killed. I could see even from my hiding \nplace that her handwriting was cramped and messy, leaving some of the blue \nink flowing off her subject like blood. \nAfter almost twenty minutes of hurried writing, she stepped back, apparently \nwaiting for the ink to dry. She then retrieved a clean scalpel from her cabinet \nand, with a care she had not given the writing, she began to cut through the \ndead woman's back, peeling away the skin upon which she had written and \nleaving behind a small patch of flayed flesh. She hung it, still dripping, upon a \nhook that I hadn't noticed on the wall, then stepped over to the phone and \nmade a call. \nThe ambulance arrived so quickly, I wondered if they had been waiting for her. \nThree men in the uniform of the London ambulance service entered.
