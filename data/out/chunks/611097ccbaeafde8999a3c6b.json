There was no sign of \nit, although a small spray of fresh blood told me that my jumpy new partner’s \naim had been too wide of the mark. \nWe... we started to hear sporadic gunfire from the rest of the building. I mean, \nit was basically all I could hear at that point as everything else was still a \nmuffled, high-pitched whine. I was worried Goodman might panic at this, but \nto his credit he seemed to have pulled himself together and we finished the \nsweep of the loading bay before heading through to the rest of the building. I \nsaw a handful of armed officers heading up the stairs to the upper floor, and I \nwas going to follow them when I felt a tug on my arm. Goodman was... he was \nsaying something and pointing towards the other direction. I saw a pair of \nuniforms and a face I recognised. Leo Altman, one of the sectioned officers \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG073 – Police Lights \n6 \n \nfrom up in Waltham Forest. I had met him once before, when Daisy took me \nout for some very quiet drinks with a few other sectioned cops she knew. I \nremembered him being one of the friendlier ones, though he still stopped \nshort of telling any stories. \nLeo was stood with an armed officer that I didn’t know. From her lack of \ntrigger discipline it looked like she was either very new or seriously rattled. \nThey were staring down a long metal staircase that seemed to lead into what \nmust have been the building’s basement. The briefing hadn’t mentioned \nanything about a basement, and it was clear they weren’t entirely sure how to \nproceed. When me and Goodman joined them it seemed to make up their \nminds and, with a quick nod to us, Leo and his partner started to head down. I \ndidn’t want to follow, and I could see that Goodman wasn’t too keen either, \nbut we weren’t just going to leave them without backup, so down we went. \nAt the bottom of the stairs was a door. It was old and made of steel that had \nstarted to rust around the edges. But... it wasn’t right. You know how when the \nlights are turned on in a room and you can see it from outside? Like, a thin line \nof light leaking under the doorway? Well, it was like that, except what seemed \nto seep out from underneath it wasn’t light. It was shadow. Like, if darkness \nwas somehow shining from behind it. As I got closer I started to hear \nsomething. I couldn’t really tell what it was under the buzzing in my ears, but \nthe best way I could describe it is that it sounded like a waterfall, but slowed \nright down. A steady, flowing crash and churn, but deep and drawn out. I \nwanted to ask the others if they heard it as well, but Leo was already moving to \nopen the door. I barely had time to get my torch out. \nI’m glad I did, though, because as the door opened every light in the building \nwent dark.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 2, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 2778}}
