There \nis no longer the wide open space surrounding them. Instead the head-height \ndividers lock them into single file, snaking back and forth in a zig-zag as their \npath approaches the shining metal gate at the end. The ground is angled ever \nso slightly down, making it uncomfortable to stand still, and always gently \nurging them to move forward. At last, the prospect of seeing what might \nhappen if he runs from the line seems worth it to Tyler, but the realisation sets \nin that it is far, far too late for that. \nOne step, then another, then another. The production balance of this place \nmeans it must be impossible for this line to be moving quicker than the ones \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 178 – The Processing Line \n13 \nbefore it, but it seems to press on with a determination that makes Tyler feel \nfaint. The interminable dread of the wait has dissipated into a very present \npanic of reaching the end of this line, but with every scream it seems to \naccelerate and all too soon he is through the gate. \n[The processing sound fades, replaced by an electric neon buzz and \nmuffled sounds of a machine turning on and off] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nIn the room before the killing floor there are three things. A mirror, a diagram, \nand a thick, black, permanent marker. Tyler stares at himself, a hundred \nthoughts running through his head as he waits his turn on the floor. He could \nrefuse, a final petty act of rebellion against a system it feels like he has run \nthrough a hundred times. But what would be the point of that? It won’t save \nhim. A wasted pile of discarded tissue is all that would be left. Is it not better, \nat least, to be useful? Tyler picks up the pen, and begins marking the cuts of \nmeat upon his body. When he is done, he walks through the door. \n[Cranking metal; a stun gun fires through meat] \n[Grunting sounds, and cutting including a bandsaw follow] \nThe bolt goes through the back of his neck with a crack, and Tyler feels himself \nfall, paralysed, to the floor. It does not kill him though, and he watches as his \nlimp body is hoisted onto the butcher’s frame. They take their time as they \ndisassemble him, making sure to let him see exactly what is about to happen at \neach step of the way. The last thing he sees before returning to the processing \nline, is everything going into the garbage. There wasn’t single suitable cut. \n“Useless,” one of the butchers says. And Tyler is gone. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 178 – The Processing Line \n14 \n[Hissing static starts] \n [The sounds of industrial processing and synchronised footsteps \nbecome duller] \n[Hissing static ends] \n[Door opens with a metal jangle as the Archivist leaves the room] \nMARTIN \n–know you find it hard whe— \n(Beat) \nDone already? \nARCHIVIST \nYes. Talking about me? \nBASIRA \nI assume that’s a rhetorical question. \nARCHIVIST \nI am trying to keep my powers to myself. \nBASIRA \nSure. \nMARTIN \nI was just… giving Basira some advice. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 178 – The Processing Line \n15 \nARCHIVIST \n(Good-natured) Avatars are from Mars and humans are from Venus, that sort \nof thing? \nMARTIN \nI mean… yeah, sort of? \n(Brief chuckle from the Archivist) \nWell, w-we were pretty much done anyway. \nARCHIVIST \nGreat. Well in that case, shall we move on? \nBASIRA \nAfter you. \nARCHIVIST \nRight. \n[They start walking; after a few seconds Martin jostles a body] \nMARTIN \nExcuse me. \nARCHIVIST \n(Exasperated) Martin, they can’t hear you— \nMARTIN \n(Sharp) I know, John. That’s not the point. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 178 – The Processing Line \n16 \nARCHIVIST \nAlright. \n[More walking] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nNext one’s through here. \nBASIRA \nNext one? \nARCHIVIST \nHer latest victim. \n[Door is wrenched open with a metallic creak] \n[Sounds of flies buzzing] \n(Martin reels) \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nRecognise her. \nBASIRA \n…No… I don’t think I do. \nARCHIVIST \nThat wasn’t a question. It was an instruction. We can’t move on until you do. \nMARTIN \nJohn, what are you getting at? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 178 – The Processing Line \n17 \nARCHIVIST \nThis isn't just a journey through spaces. \n(Beat) \nBASIRA \nFine. I recognise her. \nI don't know her name though. \nARCHIVIST \nIsabelle Moran. Shoplifter, drug addict. Daisy was certain she was dealing as \nwell. Derailed her recovery twice. \nBASIRA \nFine. Noted. \nCan we just move on please? \nARCHIVIST \nI’m afraid not. \nBASIRA \nWhy not? \nARCHIVIST \nWe aren’t finished here. \nBASIRA \nIs that a threat?", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 4, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 4470}}
