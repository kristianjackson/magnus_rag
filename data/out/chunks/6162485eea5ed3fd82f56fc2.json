I simply laid there and \ntried not to make a sound. I am not proud of this and sometimes have a \ncertainty that my inaction led directly to my brother’s death, but most of the \ntime I accept that if I had alerted the vampire to my presence then I would also \nhave died. Either way, the fact of the matter is that I did nothing as I heard the \nsounds of a struggle overhead and Nigel’s strangled cry. The creature turned \nquickly and hurled him down, something fell to the floor in front of me, but I \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG010 – Vampire Killer \n7 \n \ndidn’t look at it, my eyes locked on Sylvia McDonald as it pounced upon my \nbrother. It opened its mouth for what I then realised was the first time since \nwe met it, and I could see nothing inside save for a dozen long, thick, pointed \nteeth like a shark. In one fluid movement it plunged those teeth into my \nbrother’s neck and tore out a great chunk of flesh. Blood started to spurt from \nNigel’s spasming body, as Sylvia McDonald’s throat began to twitch. Its jaw \ndetached and a long tubular tongue about the thickness of my forearm snaked \nout of its throat and clamped onto the gushing wound. There was an awful \nslurping sound, the first noise I’d ever really heard the creature make, as the \ntongue sucked the blood from my brother’s throat. I just lay there watching as \nits stomach began to distend and swell, the now bulbous belly straining against \nthe black dress it wore. After the longest ten minutes of my life, the vampire \nfinished. Its tongue retracted back into its throat, still dripping blood onto the \nnow-pale corpse of my brother, and it lay back upon the floor, apparently \ncontented. \nAs this had been happening all my energy had gone towards not screaming or \ngiving away my presence. But as the vampire lay satiated on the floor, I turned \nmy attention to what had fallen from Nigel’s hand when he had been dragged \nout of the bed. It was his pocket knife. I had no idea what a small knife like that \nwould do against a creature that seemed far stronger and faster than me, but I \ndidn’t see any option other than to try. I moved so slowly as I reached for the \nknife that at times it seemed like I wasn’t moving at all. I was worried that the \ncreature would spot me and strike as it had with Nigel, although I now know \nthat smell is in fact the vampire’s major sense and, with all the blood around, \nthere was little chance of it detecting my scent. Grasping the knife in my \nhands, I crept over towards the creature as it placidly digested my brother’s \nlife, until I stood over it. I felt a sudden surge of rage and adrenaline come over", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 4, "chunk_count": 10, "chars": 2824}}
