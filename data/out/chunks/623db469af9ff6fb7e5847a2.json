It took some searching, but I managed to find what I believe to be the \nentry for the visit from Mr Brown’s mysterious old man. The name given is \nMaxwell Rayner. \nMartin hasn’t had much luck tracking down Mr Brown himself. According to \nCaroline Brodie, his ex-wife, she left him in 2004 after his dismissal from the \nprison service pushed him further into alcoholism and he became abusive. She \nsays she got a single letter from him in 2009 asking for reconciliation, but she \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG052 – Exceptional Risk \n17 \n \nnever replied. Martin says the letter was postmarked from Waterford in \nIreland, but he’s been unable to track Mr Brown any further. \nSo, what is this thing that seems to have stalked Robert Montauk through so \nmuch of his life? And what’s its connection to Rayner? Were they summoning \nit? Containing it? Worshipping it? Whatever the case, it seems as though \nMontauk earned its anger. I feel it might be worthwhile getting a few more \ntorches for the Archive. \nEnd recording. \n \n[CLICK] \n[CLICK] \n \nSupplemental. \nI confronted Sasha about the wax museum. It was just too strange to not \nmention. I tried to pass it off like I had spotted her accidentally while in the \narea for other reasons. I doubt she bought it, but she did at least give me an \nanswer. She has a new boyfriend, or so she claims, who works there and she \nlikes to get lunch with him. It is... plausible and at this stage. I feel challenging \nher to produce said boyfriend would potentially damage what trust remains \nbetween us. \nNo luck with any of my other leads yet, but at least I have another of \nGertrude’s tapes. It’s always going to be a shot in the dark with them, but \nhopefully an informative one. I know the secret to her death is on one of them; \nit must be. I just... I hope I don’t have to hear it first-hand. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG052 – Exceptional Risk \n18 \n \nEnd supplement. \n \n[CLICK] \n[The Magnus Archives Theme - Outro] \n \nThe Magnus Archives is a podcast distributed by Rusty Quill and licensed under \na creative commons attribution, non-commercial share alike 4.0 international \nlicense.
