He started convulsing, as grey, liquid concrete began to pour from his \nmouth, from his nose and his eyes. His limbs went rigid and I could see his \nbody starting to swell with it. I don’t know if it was me or Fernanda screaming, \nmaybe it was both of us, but I know it was her that first spotted that the \ndetritus figures were no longer choosing to stand still. That was the last I ever \nsaw of Dr Nikos Anastas. There was never any question of trying to save him. \nI don’t know how long we ran, but it was hours before we felt even remotely \nsafe. The jungle looked normal again, and more importantly, it sounded \nnormal. We tried to talk about what we’d seen, but after confirming we’d both \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 149 – Concrete Jungle \n9 \n \nwitnessed the same thing, we realised we didn’t actually have anything to say \nabout it, just this white hot fear that still hasn’t completely gone away. \nIn the end, we crossed paths with a group of real Yanomami tribesmen. They \nwere really friendly and, once they figured out that we were lost, they were \nvery happy to return us to a part of the jungle we knew, near our facility. Of \ncourse, we didn’t have a good explanation for what happened to Dr Anastas, \nso we lost our jobs pretty much immediately. But you know what? That’s fine. \nI’m done with the jungle. There’s something in there, and I don’t know which \nscares me more: the thought that it’s more than just the things we left behind; \nor that that’s all it is, and we can’t escape the ruins of our own future. \nMARTIN \nStatement ends. \nThere’s, um, a note here as well. Looks like Gertrude’s handwriting? Start of a \nletter to Dekker, thanking him for sending Judith to her, though it doesn’t look \nlike it was ever finished or sent. I assume this is another one he was trying to \nuse to prove the Extinction. It certainly has something in it. Mankind's trash \ngiving rise to something terrible. Then again, fear of the other, inanimate \nhumanoid figures... That’s all very Stranger, isn’t it? \nIt’s never simple, is it? \nSort of surprised Peter hasn’t rocked up with some more “insights”. Haven’t \nseen him around for a while, actually. I mean, it’s not like I miss him, but at \nleast he was someone to— Ah. Yeah, that makes sense. Alright, fine, just me \non my lonesome for a while, then. Could be worse. Peaceful, at least. I don’t \nmiss all the shouting, even if it were— Wait ... \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 149 – Concrete Jungle \n10 \n \n(Calls) Excuse me! Excuse me, this area is off-limits to the public! \nGEORGIE \n(Distant) Sorry? \nMARTIN \nYou can’t be here; it’s not allowed. \n[Footsteps and voice gets louder as approaches] \nGEORGIE \nOh, sorry. Um, Melanie told me to wait for her here? \nMARTIN \nOh, you’re here for Melanie? \nGEORGIE \nYeah. Georgie. \nMARTIN \nSorry. Sorry, I didn’t realise. I’m sure she’s around here somewhere. \nGEORGIE \nYou must be Martin. \nMARTIN \nYeah. Has Melanie been talking about me? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 149 – Concrete Jungle \n11 \n \nGEORGIE \nOh, um… John used to go on about you a lot. \nMARTIN \nOh. Wait, I thought Melanie-Georgie and John-Georgie were…? \nGEORGIE \nOh, uh, same Georgie. \nMARTIN \nOh. Ah. So, you and John... \nGEORGIE \nAren’t really talking anymore. \nMARTIN \nRight. \n… \nWhy not? \nGEORGIE \nExcuse me? \nMARTIN \nWhy aren’t you talking? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 149 – Concrete Jungle \n12 \n \nGEORGIE \nOh... Because I think he’s going to destroy himself and anyone who lets him get \ntoo close. And I don’t want that to include me. Or Melanie. \nMARTIN \nMaybe he just needs some help. \nGEORGIE \nI did help him, as much as I safely could, but he just carried on anyway— \nMARTIN \nYeah, he’ll do that … \nGEORGIE \n—and I realised if I kept trying it was going to hurt me more than I was willing \nto accept. \nMARTIN \nWell, sometimes helping people hurts. \nGEORGIE \nSure, but that doesn’t mean everything painful helps. Sometimes people have \nproblems that will wreck you long before you can make a dent in them. And \nsome people don’t want help; they just want other people suffering with them. \nMARTIN \nJohn doesn’t want that.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 5, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 4081}}
