Sure. I thought you quit? \nGEORGIE \nI did, for my health. But it’s already the apocalypse so… I’ll need a light too. \nARCHIVIST \nYeah. \n[Lighter snicks open] \n[Georgie lights up] \nGEORGIE \nI tried to avoid it in the tunnels when we had our, um... When the others were \nhere. \nNice lighter. \nARCHIVIST \nHmm? \n[The faintest amount of hissing static starts and ends] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nYou didn’t want to tarnish the image of the prophets? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 199 – Seeing it Through \n22 \nGEORGIE \nJust didn’t think they wanted one of their revered leaders puffing away in the \ncorner. \n(The Archivist murmurs an assent) \nSaw a bishop smoking once when I was a kid, full Easter regalia and all. Really \nweirded me out. \nARCHIVIST \n(Soft chuckles) I should probably quit myself then. \n[Light metallic sound] \nGEORGIE \nThen you won’t mind if I hang onto this? \nARCHIVIST \n(Distracted) Hmm. \n[The faintest amount of hissing static starts and ends] \nGEORGIE \nI’m sorry. I know you hate what we’re doing. \nARCHIVIST \nI hate all the options. I just... It’s all my fault, you know? \nGEORGIE \nWhat, because you weren’t able to outsmart the literal embodiment of \nmanipulation and scheming? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 199 – Seeing it Through \n23 \nARCHIVIST \nMmm. \nGEORGIE \nWe all make bad choices, John. It’s not your fault some eldritch horror decided \nyours were going to affect the whole world. \n[The Archivist takes a drag on his cigarette as Georgie speaks] \nARCHIVIST \nThey were still my choices. \nGEORGIE \nYeah. And you live with them. Or you don’t. That’s all there is, really. \nARCHIVIST \nHmm. \n[Echoes of a distant door closing] \nGEORGIE \nAnyway, looks like your next appointment’s here. \nThanks for the smoke. \n[Georgie stands to leave] \nARCHIVIST \nGeorgie… \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 199 – Seeing it Through \n24 \nGEORGIE \nYeah? \nARCHIVIST \nI, um… \n(Beat) \n[Faint footsteps climbing the stairs] \nARCHIVIST \nI’m glad you and Melanie have each other through all this. \nGEORGIE \nThanks. \nAnd I’m glad you’ve got him. \n[Footsteps get clearer] \nGEORGIE (CONT’D) \nHe’s all yours. \nMARTIN \nThanks. \n[Georgie’s footsteps descend and fade] \n(Beat) \nYou alright? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 199 – Seeing it Through \n25 \nARCHIVIST \nYeah. \nSorry it got so heated in there. \nMARTIN \nDon’t be. I’d have been more worried if you were super calm about it. \nARCHIVIST \nYeah. \nMARTIN \nI’d understand if you hate me right now. \nARCHIVIST \nWhat? No! No, Martin, I love you. I always will. And I know you love me too. I \nmean… (sighs) that’s it, isn’t it? That’s the real core of it. You want to save me. \nMARTIN \nI want you to save yourself. \n(The Archivist takes a long breath) \nARCHIVIST \nSometimes… I imagine if none of this had happened. If we had just... met. Been \ntogether, w-without… all of this. \nMARTIN \n(Softly) Me too. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 199 – Seeing it Through \n26 \n[Martin shifts on his feet] \nMARTIN (CONT’D) \nBut we wouldn’t have, would we? Been together I mean. \nARCHIVIST \nHuh? W-what do you mean? \nMARTIN \nWell, we had that, didn’t we? Almost a year of just working a normal job \ntogether, and you hated me. \nARCHIVIST \nI didn’t ‘hate’ you. \nMARTIN \nNo, no, no, no. I listened to those tapes. At one point you explicitly said you’d \nbe fine with me being chopped up by that old jigsaw lady. \nARCHIVIST \nOh god, Angela! Ha! \nShe’s still about, you know? Lording it over a nasty little Flesh domain. \nAnyway, I didn’t explicitly say it, I… implied it. \nMARTIN \nFace it, John, it took almost two years of crisis and trauma to even make us \ncompatible. And that sucks. But here we are.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 4, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 3859}}
