The lock was closed but \nhad the key sitting inside it. I started to reach for it, when I noticed two other \nthings on the coffin lid. The first was a piece of paper, folded in half and tucked \nunder the chain, which I took. The other was the presence of three words, \nscratched deep into the wood of the casket in letters three inches high. They \nread “Do Not Open”. \nI withdrew my hand from the padlock slowly, unsure what I was supposed to \ndo. At some point I must have sat down, as I found myself on the floor, \npropped up against the wall, staring at this bizarre thing that had inexplicably \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG002 – Do Not Open \n6 \n \nturned up at my home. I remembered the piece of paper at this point and \nunfolded it, but it simply read “Delivered with gratitude – J”. \nStrange as it sounds, it was only then I made the connection with the man I’d \nmet in Amsterdam. He’d told me wanted someone to look after a package for \na while. Was this the package he was talking about? Was I to be looking after a \ncorpse? Who was coming to pick it up? When? I called in sick to work, and just \nsat there, watching the coffin for what might have been minutes or might have \nbeen hours. I just had no idea what to do. Eventually I steeled myself and \nmoved towards it, until my face was just inches away from the lid. I took a \ndeep breath, trying to see if I could smell anything from inside. Nothing. If \nthere was a dead body in there, it hadn’t started to smell yet. Not that I really \nknew what a dead body smelled like. \nIt was early summer at this point, which would mean they must have died \nrecently. If there was a body in there at all. As I got up, my hand brushed the \nwood of the coffin and I realised it was warm. Very warm, like it had been lying \nin the sun for hours. Something about it made my flesh crawl slightly and I \nwithdrew my hand quickly. \nI decided to make a cup of tea. It was something of a relief, standing next to \nthe kettle, as from that angle I couldn’t see the thing out in the hall. I could just \nignore it. I didn’t move even after I’d filled my mug; I just stood there sipping \nmy tea, not even noticing that it was still far too hot to drink comfortably. \nWhen I finally got the nerve to step back out into the hall, the coffin still lay \nthere, unmoving. I finally made a decision and, firmly gripping the padlock, I \nremoved the key, and placed it on the hall table next to the door. I then took \nhold of the coffin and chain and started to pull it further into my flat. It was \nweird to touch it: the wood still had that unsettling warmth to it, but the chain", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 3, "chunk_count": 9, "chars": 2710}}
