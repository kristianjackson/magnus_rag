It should have been pitch dark. There was no light at \nall filtering through into those underground caverns. But instead, I, I could see \neverything. Every detail of the shrivelled corpse before me was as clear as day, \nthough there was no light to see it. I, I can’t explain it, even really describe how \nit felt, but it was absolute darkness and I could still see. At the same time, I \nsuddenly got the most intense feeling of being watched, like a thousand eyes \nturned to me at once. \nI froze. From somewhere, deeper within that strange, ancient library, there \nwas the sound of movement – the rustling of cloth and a slow, rhythmic step \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 053 - Crusader \n13 \n \ncoming towards me. I started to back away, towards the tunnel that had \nbrought me there, but it was hard. The sense of being watched was getting \nstronger, an almost physical weight that seemed to drag me down. \nI reached the mouth of the tunnel just as a figure came into view. It wore what \nlooked like the remains of an ancient robe and, in the darkness, I could see \nlong, spindly fingers stretching, probing towards me. From within its huge, \nflowing hood, I could see nothing except a single, lidless eye. \nI, I, I don’t know at what point I started screaming, but I know I didn’t stop until \nI was restrained by military police, fleeing through the streets of Alexandria in \nthe early hours of the morning. I spent another month there undergoing \npsychiatric evaluation, before being discharged. \nGERTRUDE \nI see. Did you locate that basement again? \nWALTER \nWell, well, well I wanted to, but I was supervised the rest of my time in \nAlexandria. \nGERTRUDE \nDid you tell any of your superiors about it? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 053 - Crusader \n14 \n \nWALTER \nNo, I, I, I was half convinced I’d dreamt the whole thing up. \nGERTRUDE \nAnd did you replace the grate? \nWALTER \nThe, the, the what? \nGERTRUDE \nThe bronze grate over the entrance to the archive. Did you replace it when you \nfled? \nWALTER \nI... yes, yes, yes, I think I did. \nGERTRUDE \nOne other thing. That feeling of being watched, have you ever had it since? \nWALTER \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 053 - Crusader \n15 \n \nWell, I wasn’t sure whether to say anything, but yes, I have. Just now. That \nfunny turn I took on the way down the stairs. I felt it again. All those eyes \nwatching me. \nGERTRUDE \nThank you, Walter. Now, I need to check some maps with you, but I don’t think \nwe need that on tape. Are you alright here for now? \nWALTER \nOh, well, I should be. \nGERTRUDE \nIt’s unlikely to happen, but if anyone else comes down here... \nWALTER \nI’ll tell them I’m an old friend of yours, paying you a visit. \nGERTRUDE \nThank you. This statement is off the record and I don’t want anyone to bother \nyou about it further. Let’s keep it between us. \n[Tape clicks off.] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 053 - Crusader \n16 \n \nGERTRUDE \nWell, that was certainly useful. It’s taken a long time to track down someone \nstill living who found the Serapeum of Alexandria. It’s not a full confirmation of \nmy theory about ancient iterations of the Archive, but I’m certainly feeling \nvalidated for pursuing it. I’d been working on the assumption that the great \nlibrary itself would have fulfilled the function, but it makes a lot more sense \nthat it would have been the Serapeum offshoot. The ruins of the main \nSerapeum itself near Pompey’s Pillar are quite well researched, so this could be \nthe secret caves mentioned in certain accounts of its destruction. \nAccording to Eunapius, the destruction of the Serapeum in 391 AD was \nconducted by a Christian mob, emboldened by the reforms of Pope Theodosius \nI, attempting to drive the worship of all other gods from Alexandria. There are \nother accounts, however, that claim the scholars barricaded themselves inside \nwith prisoners and retreated to hidden caverns deep below. Some even go so \nfar as to claim the captives were tortured into the worship of pagan deities or \noffered as blood sacrifices. There’s even one unnamed contemporary historian \nthat describes the mob attacking the Serapeum not as Christians, but using a \nphrase which roughly translates as ‘those who sing the night’.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 5, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 4262}}
