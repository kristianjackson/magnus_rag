That was when I awoke. I’m well aware that I don’t even know your name, \nand I have no responsibility to try and prevent whatever fate is coming for you. \nBased on my previous experience, such a thing is likely impossible anyway, but \nafter what I saw I couldn’t live with myself if I didn’t at least try. I did as much \nresearch into your Institute as possible, and arranged an appointment to \nprovide a statement about some spurious supernatural encounter. Even then I \nwas told that the Archivist only reviews the written statements once they have \nbeen taken, so here I am, pouring out my lunatic story on paper in the hopes \nthat you might eventually read it. \nIf you do see this in time and read this far, then to be honest I don’t know what \nelse to tell you. Be careful. There is something coming for you and I don’t know \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG011 – Dreamer \n10 \n \nwhat it is, but it is so much worse than anything I can imagine. At the very least \nyou should look into appointing a successor. Good luck. \nJONATHAN SIMS \nStatement ends. \nI’m sure I don’t need to explain how disquieting it was to find this statement \ntucked into the recent archives. I’m not… entirely sure whether to bring this up \nwith Elias or not. When he hired me, he was vague on the point of what \nhappened to my predecessor, Gertrude Robinson. I asked if she would be \navailable to train me up for a handover, but he simply said she had passed \naway and not to worry about it overmuch. Actually, now I think about it, his \nexact phrase was that she “died in the line of duty”, which I had assumed \nmeant having a stroke at her desk or something similar. She was quite elderly, I \nbelieve. \nI mean, I don’t believe in the predictive power of dreams, obviously, but still, \nit’s a deeply unsettling thing to find. I had Tim look into it, as I don’t entirely \ntrust the others not to have written it as a practical joke and slipped it into the \narchives. Unsurprisingly, he came up with nothing. Antonio Blake is a fake \nname and all of the contact details he provided were similarly fraudulent. It’s \nalmost certainly a joke, a bit of hazing for the new boss, maybe? Best not to \nengage with it, I think. \nStill, I might have a word with Rosie, to make sure I get a copy of any new \nstatements as soon as they’re made, not just once the researchers are done \nwith them. She seemed very open to idea of recording them, so I’m hopeful \nshe’ll be willing to do this too. If this is genuine, well, I have no idea if Gertrude \ngot the chance to read this statement before she passed away, but if anyone \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG011 – Dreamer \n11 \n \ncomes in ranting about dreaming my death, then I very much want to hear \nabout it. \nEnd recording \n[The Magnus Archives Theme - Outro] \n \nThe Magnus Archives is a podcast distributed by Rusty Quill and licensed under \na creative commons attribution, non-commercial share alike 4.0 international \nlicense.
