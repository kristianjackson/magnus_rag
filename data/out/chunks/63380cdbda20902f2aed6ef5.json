I almost felt bad \nfor them, but it was in most ways a relief, to know I wouldn’t need to worry \nabout them interfering with my own project. \nExactly how the launch was arranged, I couldn’t tell you, but I assume the \ncalculations must have been done by one of ours. Otherwise, well, weight is \nvery important when planning a launch, and it could hardly have escaped their \nnotice that there were four people in that rocket: three astronauts and one \nunlucky nyctophobe, sealed in a lightless box, silenced but not sedated, \napparently indistinguishable from the rest of the supplies. I never learned his \nname, never needed to. He was simply a battery, a ready source of constant \nterror I could draw on for my experiments. However Maxwell had contrived to \nstop him screaming seemed most effective, and the closest I ever came to \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 135 – Dark Matter \n \n7 \n \ndiscovery was when Kilbride expressed confusion at the rate the supplies were \ndiminishing. It was really only the two of us anyway, with Chilcott sealed away, \nhaving his own little breakdown, and Jan was always a bit of an idiot, so ready \nto believe anyone’s lies. But I suppose I don’t need to tell you that, do I, \nGertrude? \nMy experiments continued largely uninterrupted, pushing the boundaries of \nlight, darkness and fear. It was dangerous work, and more than once I got too \nclose to the light and it almost destroyed me, but it didn’t. I could regale you \nwith the technical terms or scientific disciplines I played with and rendered \nmeaningless, but in the end all you actually need to know is that I succeeded. A \ntiny, terrible sun of the pitchest black, shining beautiful darkness all around it. \nBy that time, my colleagues had long since succumbed to the torments they \nwere assigned, and I had no difficulty storing the black star securely, before \npulling them onto the shuttle for the return journey. And then the three of us \nreturned to Earth. Just as well. The final experiment had left my battery in such \na state that no amount of soundproofing could dampen the screams, and I was \nglad of the peace and quiet. \nThat’s all I really came here to say, to let you know we had succeeded, and to \nmake your boss an offer on behalf of Maxwell. I suppose there is also an \nelement of provocation here as well. Even with the loss of Darvish, we will still \nbe victorious. We have watched you, Gertrude. I suppose you’re used to that, \nbut we know what you’re capable of. So, consider this a challenge. I would love \nnothing more than to see you destroyed by the radiance of the dark sun we \nhave created. So, by all means do your worst. Or prostrate yourself, both of \nyou, before the Forever Blind, and perhaps you might be spared. Maxwell and I \nawait your decision with keen interest.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 4, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 2829}}
