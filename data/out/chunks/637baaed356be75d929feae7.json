The only light in the room spilled out from the static of the old television \nscreen, casting his agonies in a pale and washed out cathode-ray glow. \n[Gasps of breath continue, strong fabric rustles of a fight; the \nmuffled internal body sounds and wet noises intensify] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nHis coat and the shirt beneath it were rags now, torn by the sharp, flailing \nfingers that reached out from his shoulder. Malcolm tried to breath, to \nconcentrate or centre himself, to find any way to carve out a moment in the \nchaos and think. But there was none. He pulled off the remaining slivers of \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 194 – Parting \n \n18 \nmaterial, exposing the tiny, half-formed face and limbs to the open air. And he \nraised the knife. \n[Knife clinks] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \n“Do it, you coward!” \n[Visceral sounds of bone and flesh cracking and contorting] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nAs Malcolm plunged the blade into his shoulder, he felt it split. Skin, muscle \nand bone torn apart, opening up like an earthquake fissure, a red and gore-\nstreaked chasm into himself. The sound he made could technically be called a \nscream, but the agonies he cried out through a gurgling throatful of blood \nwere beyond any noise he could have conceived himself making. \n[Wet gurgling throat noises are heard as fleshy noises continue] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nFrom the wound came first a hand, then slowly, inch by inch, the arm followed, \nwrapping itself around his neck for purchase, and pulling out a shoulder, a \nneck, a face. A sneering, familiar face. \nIt took ten minutes for the bloody form to emerge in its entirety, and another \ntwenty for it to writhe and crawl its way over and up onto the old armchair. \n[Dreadful visceral sounds; then an armchair springs squeak as \nsomething sits; fleshy movement stop] \n[A wheezing breath from elderly lungs starts drawing air, joining \nthe gurgling throat noise] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 194 – Parting \n \n19 \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nThrough all this time, Malcolm lay there, quietly bleeding, tears streaming \ndown his cheek, and soaking into the carpet. The pain was nothing to him, not \nanymore. What he hated most, what he truly feared, was what stared down at \nhim from that chair, that once again regarded him with sneering, bitter \njudgement. He could feel the old man’s eyes on him, and he knew that he \nwould never be rid of them. \n[Hissing static starts] \n[The sounds transition to that of London outdoors: helicopters, \ndrones, camera iris movements] \n[Hissing static ends] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nNot exactly subtle. But then you never were, were you? Not really. \nWell. If that's the most compelling argument you have... \n(Smiles) I’m going to go and apologise to my boyfriend. \n[He starts walking] \n[Tape clicks off] \n[Tape clicks on] \n[In the tunnels, the Archivist opens the door to Leitner’s room, \nwhere Melanie’s comfy chair is; he walks in] \nARCHIVIST \nMartin? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 194 – Parting \n \n20 \n[Door shuts] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nMartin I’m, I’m sorry. You’re right, I— \n[A chair scrapes on the floor] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nOh. \n(The Archivist coughs nervously) \nSorry. Thought you were someone else. \nCELIA \nIt’s okay. I-I was actually looking for you. \nARCHIVIST \nWhy? What’s— Sorry, um, do you know where Marti— the, the man I-I was \nwith, do you know where he is? \nCELIA \nThat’s what I wanted to check! I saw him a while ago, up near one of the \ntrapdoors. I… I didn’t recognise the woman with him, so I wanted to check if \nyou were expecting anyone else before I woke the prophets. \nARCHIVIST \n(Suspicious) What, what woman? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 194 – Parting \n \n21 \nCELIA \nI don’t know. \nARCHIVIST \n(Concerned) What did she look like? \nCELIA \nUh… Youngish, Black, dressed... normal, I suppose. She had a thing on her \nhead, like a... I don’t know. \n(Concerned breath from the Archivist) \nLike a, a woolly hat? But… I-I don’t know, it looked a bit weird. \nARCHIVIST \nA-Annabelle, oh— \nCELIA \nOh, I didn’t catch her name— \nARCHIVIST \nShh-shh-shh! I— Please, I, I need to concentrate. \n[Hissing static starts] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \n(Very quietly) Where are you, Martin? Come on, come on, come on; don’t do \nthis to me. Not now… Argh! Oh god. Okay, okay, um... \n[Hissing static ends]", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 5, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 4355}}
