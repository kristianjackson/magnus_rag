They tend to be the messy ones. The ones that don’t \nreally have any sense or resolution, no narrative flow. Where there isn’t even a \nguess at an explanation, and often you end up just thinking, “Is that it?” \nThere was one, though, that caught my eye. It was some anonymous worker at \nthe C.F. Booth scrap metal and recycling yard. If you haven’t heard of it, it’s in \nRotherham, and it’s one of the biggest train graveyards in the UK. The guy said \nhe worked there scrapping train, but there was one metal rail car that had \nbeen there since he got the job, and it never seemed to be on the queue for \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG076 – The Smell of Blood \n5 \n \nrecycling. He’d asked his supervisor, but they just shrugged and told him if it \nwasn’t queued it didn’t get scrapped, and he couldn’t get a straight answer out \nof anybody as to why it had just been sat there for years. \nHe said it was old, like 1950s old, or even earlier maybe. More than that, he \nsaid that anytime he passed it while working late, he got a really strong, \nmetallic odour that cut through all the other smells of the junkyard. He said \nhe’d never been inside the carriage, but that it smelled like old blood. \nThe same post was on a couple of different forums, and each time told slightly \ndifferently. It wasn’t copy-pasted, and it seemed like the posts had been made \nover the course of a couple of years. There was nothing really to separate it \nfrom the hundreds of horror story liars that surrounded it, but it stuck with me. \nIt kept playing on my mind, something about the way he had described the old \nrolling stock felt real to me. \nSo, I decided to check it out. I have family up in Sheffield that I hadn’t seen in \nway too long, so I made arrangements to go and stay with them for a week. I \nfigured it wouldn’t be too hard to head out and check the yard at night, since \nRotherham’s only a few miles away. \nI was right about how easy it was to get there, but not about getting in. I \nalways forget how big a target places like that are for thieves, and how hard \nthey work to keep them out. High walls, sturdy gates and security guards all \nstood between me and this supposedly haunted train. I should have turned \nback, really, but by then I was kind of obsessed with finding anything to \nreassure me that I hadn’t been seeing things back in Aldershot. \nARCHIVIST \nI think I understand the feeling. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG076 – The Smell of Blood \n6 \n \nMELANIE \nI'm sure you do. I got over the wall on my third night of watching. I’d managed \nto figure out enough about how the cameras and security guards covered the \nplace that I could take a full minute to get over quietly. \nThe forum poster whose lead I was following hadn’t given much away about \nhis own identity, but he had been very detailed in describing what I was \nlooking for. \nAn almost featureless steel boxcar, with a slightly curved roof, large \nwindowless sliding door, and a few flecks of olive green paint still visible. Even \nso, finding it was tricky. There was almost no light inside the yard except for \nthe security lights that I was trying not to trip. I had brought a torch of course, \nbut I was reluctant to turn it on in case I was spotted. \nAfter about ten minutes, I began to realise that my eyes weren’t actually going \nto be the best way to find it. Because there, on the wind, was the smell of \nblood. It was faint at first, but as I felt my way past old, discarded trains, it got \nstronger. \nMy eyes had adjusted now, and I could see the rusted ancient skeletons of \nfreight and passenger cars. They stood empty and still, silhouetted against that \ndull orange of a cloudy sky that glowed with light pollution. As I got closer I \nstarted to get jumpy, and I swear more than once I saw figures sat in the \nbroken windows of those old trains. They were never there when I looked \nagain. \nFinally, I saw it, the stark, angular shape clear even in the dark. It was far \nenough from the security stations that I finally dared to turn on my torch.
