I suppose there is also an \nelement of provocation here as well. Even with the loss of Darvish, we will still \nbe victorious. We have watched you, Gertrude. I suppose you’re used to that, \nbut we know what you’re capable of. So, consider this a challenge. I would love \nnothing more than to see you destroyed by the radiance of the dark sun we \nhave created. So, by all means do your worst. Or prostrate yourself, both of \nyou, before the Forever Blind, and perhaps you might be spared. Maxwell and I \nawait your decision with keen interest. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 135 – Dark Matter \n \n8 \n \nARCHIVIST \nStatement ends. \nWell, that’s ... concerning. I mean, the sun’s still there, so I assume they failed. \nUnless they’re still waiting to attempt it. That’s not the sort of statement you \ngive four years before you try to actually ... Or is it? The timeframes on these \nattempts, these rituals, well … They seem variable, to say the least. When I try \nto think about it ... \nI, uh, it just ... darkness. Unhelpful, but not unexpected. I’ll keep digging. If \nthere is another ritual upcoming, I’ll need all the information I can get on it. I \ncan’t believe Gertrude didn’t have a plan for it. I hope I’m just being \novercautious, that it’s already long-since dealt with, but ... We’ll see. \nAt least the coffin’s gone. I gave Artefact Storage some very specific \ninstructions and they’ve got it solidly sealed away. Is locking it up the right \nthing to do? There are other people in there and Daisy and I got out, but ... No. \nI can’t think about that. Even if I could somehow be sure of recreating our \nescape, I can’t save everyone that’s been taken. It’s not my job to try. And I \ncan’t spend another three days in there. I just … I need to let it go. \nI don’t like interacting with the rest of the Institute these days. The way they \nlook at me, I ... I don’t know. I don’t know what they’ve heard, what the \nrumours going around are, but they have definitely heard something. And they \ncan’t wait until they don’t have to talk to me anymore. Can’t honestly say I \nblame them. None of this is easy. Everyone’s just trying to get through as best \nthey can, living one day at a time. But I can’t afford to be just living one day at \na time; I need a plan. But I don’t even know what I’m trying to achieve, and no-\none wants to tell me. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 135 – Dark Matter \n \n9 \n \nEnd recording \n[Tape clicks off. Tape clicks on.] \nELIAS \nNice to see you again, Detective. \nBASIRA \nStill not a detective. Never was. \nELIAS \nOh, but everyone else seems to be getting a title these days, why shouldn’t— \nBASIRA \nCut the shit. What are you playing at? \nELIAS \nI’m sure I don’t know what you mean. \nBASIRA \nLike hell you don’t. Every lead a dead end, every contact vanished or dead. \nI spent three weeks bouncing all over the globe on your bad intel, because you \nsaid there was a way to bring Daisy back. \nELIAS \nThere was. It required you to be absent. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 135 – Dark Matter \n \n10 \n \nBASIRA \nYou wanted him to go in there? \nELIAS \nAnd you would never have allowed it had you been present. \nBASIRA \nWhy? \nELIAS \nWould you simply believe I wanted you and Daisy reunited? \nBASIRA \nNo. \nELIAS \nFine. Consider it a test. Things are coming, things that will need John to be far \nstronger and more willing to use his connection to our patron. His performance \nduring the Unknowing was ... disappointing. I needed a way to force him to \nharness his ability more acutely than he had before. The coffin was a useful \ntool, Daisy an adequate bait. \nBASIRA \nThen you messed up. Way he tells it, he doesn’t know how he got out of there.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 5, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 3803}}
