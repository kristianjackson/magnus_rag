Graham \nclearly felt awkward enough with the silence to do the talking for both of us, \nand I learned more about him over the next hour than I’d ever had a desire to \nknow. Apparently his parents had died in a car accident a few years previously \nand had left a great deal of money and ownership of this flat. He didn’t need to \nwork anymore and so had found himself somewhat adrift, taking night college \ncourses to pass the time and broaden his mind - his words, not mine. He said \nhe was trying to figure out what to actually do with his life. \nHe talked on like this for a while but I stopped listening about that point, as I’d \nbecome enraptured by the table on which he’d placed my tea. It was an ornate \nwooden thing, with a snaking pattern of lines weaving their way around \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG003 – Across The Street \n6 \n \ntowards the centre. The pattern was hypnotic and shifted as I watched it, like \nan optical illusion. I found my eyes following the lines towards the middle of \nthe table, where there was nothing but a small square hole. Graham noticed \nme staring and told me that interesting antique furniture was one of his few \ntrue passions. \nApparently he’d found the table in a second-hand shop during his student days \nand fallen in love with it. It had been in pretty bad shape but he’d spent a long \ntime and a lot of money restoring it, though he’d never been able to figure out \nwhat was supposed to go in the centre. He assumed it was a separate piece \nand couldn’t track it down. And yeah, like most of his conversation, I’d have \nfound it dull even if I wasn’t concussed. But by this time, I was beginning to \nfeel well enough to leave and started to make my excuses to Graham. He \nexpressed his concern, said it hadn’t been as long enough, as the medics \nsuggested, but if I had to... Well, you get the picture. In the end I did leave, as I \nkept getting lost in the lines of the table, and the pipes outside of the window \nmade such a weird noise that I didn’t think staying was actually going to help \nme recover. \nI went straight home, making sure Graham couldn’t see me from his window, \nand spent a few hours watching TV until I recovered enough to go to sleep. By \nthe time I woke up the next morning I was feeling more or less ok, though I \nkept a plaster on the cut on my forehead, and tried not to think too much \nabout the previous night. \nOne evening a few days later, though, I found myself staring out of my \nwindow, the one that faced the street, and I remembered how close Graham \nlived. I looked to see if I could figure out which window was his and, yeah, sure \nenough, there it was. It was actually a remarkably clear view of his flat, and I", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 3, "chunk_count": 9, "chars": 2739}}
