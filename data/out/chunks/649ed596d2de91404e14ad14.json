And as for those unlucky enough to survive its rule... I don’t think \nthey’d be in a state to do anything about it. \n(Gerard exhales a pfft) \nGERARD \nWell. Then I guess we’d better not let it happen. \nGERTRUDE \nWell. Quite. Now. I believe you have an evil book to burn? \nGERARD \nYeah. Of course. \n[He starts to leave] \nGERARD (CONT’D) \nYou, uh- need anything else burning? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 162 – A Cosy Cabin \n13 \nGERTRUDE \n(Wryly) No, no. Not right now. I think I’m alright, thank you for the offer. \nGERARD \nRight. \nGERTRUDE \nOh, and, Gerard— \nGERARD \nHm? \nGERTRUDE \nDon’t go rifling through my things in future. It could end... badly for you. \n[Tape click] \n[The strange howls, wind and creaks resume] \n[The cassette tape is removed from the recorder and another tape \nis put in] \n[Tape click] \n[Rummaging noises that appear close to the tape recorder] \nSASHA \nThis it? \n[Sasha hands Tim the recorder] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 162 – A Cosy Cabin \n14 \nTIM \nOh, thank god. I thought I was seeing things. \nSASHA \nGlad I could help. \nTIM \nI didn’t know he was actually gonna ask me to get it for him; I just mentioned it \n’cause he was talking about recording. \nSASHA \nWell, I’m sure he’s waiting! \nTIM \nMm, he can wait a bit longer. \n[Tim puts the recorder down] \nSASHA \nFantastic! Good of you to volunteer to help me. \n[Page rustles] \nTIM \nUh- I, I didn’t actually- \nSASHA \nGrab a stapler. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 162 – A Cosy Cabin \n15 \nTIM \n(Sighs) Fine. \n[Picks up stapler] \nTIM (CONT’D) \nWhat are we doing? \n[Page flipping] \nSASHA \nJohn’s been getting frustrated with all the loose statement sheets around. \n(stapler) I’m going box by box, collating and stapling them. And now, so are \nyou. \nTIM \n(Exaggerated sigh) If you say so. \nSASHA \n(Mock sympathy) I do. \n[A few moments pass in silence with them flipping through \nstatements and stapling. As they resume talking, the noises of \npaper and stapling continue] \nTIM \n(Sigh) So. How are you finding our new leader? \nSASHA \nMm, alright, I suppose. Early days yet. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 162 – A Cosy Cabin \n16 \nTIM \nSure, sure. \n(Beat) \nTIM (CONT’D) \nDo you think he knows what he’s doing? \nSASHA \nMm, he’ll get there. I just wish he wouldn’t take it out on Martin in the \nmeantime. \nTIM \nIf only there had been someone more qualified! \nSASHA \nTim. \nTIM \nSasha. \nSASHA \nIt’s Elias’s decision. \nTIM \nIt’s some sexist bullshit, is what it is. \nSASHA \nI mean. Probably. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 162 – A Cosy Cabin \n17 \nTIM \nLook, it should have been you, and you just know if you had called him out, the \nlittle weasel would start talking about traditions, and— (bad Elias \nimpersonation) —the values of our esteemed founder, Jimmy Magma. \n(Sasha laughs) \nTIM (CONT’D) \nJoanie.. Magnum? \nSASHA \nCloser. \nTIM \nJack Magnet? \nSASHA \nThat’s the one. \nTIM \nAh, I’m serious, though. You should say something. \nSASHA \nMm, Tim- I’ve been in academia for what, ten years now? \nTIM \nMm. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 162 – A Cosy Cabin \n18 \nSASHA \nI know how this goes! I didn’t get the job. If I kick up a stink, I’ll just get \nblackballed. \nTIM \n(Resigned) Ah, yeah. \n(Beat) \n(Mischievous) What if we kill him? \nSASHA \n(Amused) What, Elias? \n[Stapling and paper noises pause] \nTIM \nNo. Big Boss Sims. Cut the brakes on his office chair; no one would ever know. \n(Sasha laughs) \nTIM (CONT’D) \nSwap in a poisoned tea bag, pin it on Martin— the perfect crime. \nSASHA \n(Still laughing) And how do you know that you won’t be the one that gets it? \nThat boy makes a lot of tea. \nTIM \nOh, it’s okay; I spent the last few years building up an immunity to iocane \npowder.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 2, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 3958}}
