It was all a bit surreal, watching pens sign my \nlife into its different stages without holding any of them myself. As the man in \nthe suit told me to follow him in a clipped BBC accent, Agnes walked over and \ngestured for me to lean down and listen to her. I did so, but instead of a \nconspiratorial whisper, she just gave me a quick kiss on the cheek, then ran off \ndown the hall. I stood there for a moment, confused, before my temporary \nguardian once again instructed me to follow him. \nI did so, and the cold air of the outside hit me like a slap across the face. We \nwalked for a few minutes to the end of the road and I felt as though my \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 059 – Recluse \n10 \n \nmeagre suitcase was almost frozen to my hand. He told me to wait there while \nhe brought his car around, then disappeared down a side street. I stood there \nas the bitter wind cut through my thin coat. The sun was out, but it didn’t do \nmuch to soften the sharpness of the February air as I waited. \nThen, without warning, I wasn’t waiting anymore. I had turned around, put \ndown my suitcase and started walking back towards Raymond Fielding’s house. \nI didn’t want to go back. I had no reason to go back, but I had apparently \ndecided to anyway, because I knew that’s where I was going. After two and a \nhalf years, I was rather used to this feeling, but there was something else there \nthis time, something in the back of my mind, a frantic, scuttling terror. It didn’t \ndo any good though; I was returning to Hill Top Road, no matter what I might \nfeel about it. Choice didn’t even come into it. \nThe door was unlocked when I returned, and the house was quiet. My eyes \ndarted around, looking for anyone who might be able to tell me what was \ngoing on, why the fine threads that pulled me through my life had dragged me \nback here, but I was alone. I walked over to the door that led down into the \nbasement into Ray’s study, and I was suddenly struck by the realisation that \nnobody other than him had ever gone inside. At least not to my knowledge. \nNonetheless, I reached up and turned the handle. It twisted silently and the \ndoor swung open, revealing a set of stairs leading down. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 059 – Recluse \n11 \n \nLight bulbs in spherical lampshades lit the way and the thought struck me that, \ngiven how much time Ray spent down here, it was surprising how many \ncobwebs there were. They covered every corner, and lightly coated part of the \nwalls. As I headed down the stairs, closing the door behind me, I saw even \nmore and came to the unsettling realisation that what covered the bare bulbs \nwere not, in fact, lampshades, but were instead thick clumps of cobweb. \nThe sight that greeted me when I finally reached the bottom of the stairs was \nabout as far from what I had expected as it could possibly have been. Rather \nthan a study filled with books, papers, desks or the like, the room was large \nand almost empty. The walls and ceiling were bare earth and it looked more \nlike a burrow than anything else. In the centre of the room stood that strange \nhypnotic table, though how he had gotten the heavy wooden thing down here \nwas beyond me. The whole place was covered with a thick gossamer of \nspider’s web, and in the thick clumps around the edges of the chamber, I saw \nshapes I recognised. Doris Hardy, Dick Barradale, Greg Montgomery – the older \nones, who had left the house before I had. They lay still now, wrapped in their \nsticky cocoons. Their bodies seemed warped and bloated in a way I didn’t \nrecognise, but that’s only because, at that point in my life, I had never before \nseen a spider egg sac.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 4, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 3704}}
