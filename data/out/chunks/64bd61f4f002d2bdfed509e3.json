The \nwriting was still unintelligible to me and it felt no different. I lifted it to have a \ncloser look, and as I did I heard something clatter lightly onto the floor. I \nlooked down to see bones. Small animal bones, from what I can tell, but each \none was slightly bent and warped into shapes that bones should not form. As I \nstared at them, Mary Keay took the book back from me and passed it through \nthe shadows once again. More bones fell. She did this several times, until there \nwas a small pile formed at my feet. \nI didn’t know what to say. By this point my head was pounding and the feel of \nthis cramped, dark place with its old tea and ancient books was starting to \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG004 – Page Turner \n11 \n \noverwhelm me. All I could think to ask was whether my book did that as well. \nMary Keay laughed and told me to look for myself. I began to look through \nthose pages. I hadn’t passed it through any shadows, but I knew something \nhad changed. The woodcuts were starker, somehow, and in the background of \neach there were new lines, thick and dark, stretching down from the sky. And \nthen I came to the picture of that empty night, but now it had a stark, \nbranching pattern carving through it. A pattern I recognised. My stomach \ndropped, as though the floor was gone and I was falling. \nStruggling to stay standing, I muttered some excuse and went to leave. The \nozone smell was back now, stronger than ever, and I had to get out. I fell down \nthe stairs as I fled, badly bruising my hip and twisting my ankle painfully, but I \ndidn’t care. I limped from that place as quickly as I could and hailed a taxi to \ntake me home, fingers still locked in a death-grip on my book. \nThe branching pattern I had seen in that picture is known as the Lichtenberg \nfigure. It shows the diverging paths of electricity on an insulating material, such \nas glass or resin. I knew it from the pattern of scars on the back of my \nchildhood friend, who had been struck by lightning because of me. His name \nwas Michael Crew, and we’d been 8 years old at the time, playing in a field \nnear my grandmother’s house. When the storm hit, Michael had said that we \nshould go inside, but I wanted to keep playing in the rain. I said that to him, \nand he just sighed and told me alright. It was as he said these words that he \nwas struck. The sound when it happened was so loud that it drowned out his \nscreams completely, but it was the smell that really stayed with me: that \npowerful ozone smell, cut through with the scent of cooking meat. Michael \nsurvived, in the end, but the scar, that branching Lichtenberg scar, stayed with \nhim for the rest of his life. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG004 – Page Turner \n12 \n \nWhen I got home it took all of my concentration to get up the stairs, and when \nI finally made it onto my sofa I couldn’t shake that feeling as though I was \nfalling. The smell was so strong I could hardly breathe. I didn’t look at the book, \nI just lay there. I felt as though I was waiting for something, but I had no idea \nwhat. \nBy the time the knock on the door finally came, I was almost feeling composed \nenough to answer. Almost. It still took me almost five minutes to work up the \nnerve to open it. The knock did not come again, but I was positive that \nwhatever was on the other side had not gone away. I reached over, grasped \nthe handle and pulled the door open. Stood just over the threshold was a man \nin a long, dark leather coat. His hair was dyed an artificial black, and he had the \nunshaven look of someone who hadn’t slept in a couple of days. I asked him if \nhe was Gerard Keay. He said that he was, and told me he’d like to see my book. \nI nodded silently and he followed me inside, closing the door behind him. \nI took out the book and placed it on the table. Gerard studied it for some time, \nbut did not touch it. Finally, he nodded and offered to buy it from me for five \nthousand pounds. I almost laughed when he said that. I would have sold it for a \nfraction of the amount. I might even have given it away, if it wasn’t for the \nfeeling that that… wouldn’t count somehow. It’s hard to explain. I didn’t care \nwhat he planned to do with it, I just wanted to get rid of it, and so I agreed. \nGerard didn’t seem exactly happy at the news. He just nodded gravely and \nheaded towards the door, saying he’d need to get the money and return. I \ndidn’t try to stop him. He left, closing the door behind him and I was alone \nonce again.
