According to him, if it was still in \ngood shape, it would have been an amazing place to put on a light show, and \nhave his guests dance their way through the maze. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 156 – Reflection \nSounds like a good way to get injured to me, but apparently I used the word \n’rave’ wrong, so what do I know? \nAnyway, that was his first stop after checking that the wooden floor of the \nmain avenue was still solid, which it was, and that the central square would be \nable to take the weight of the heavy speakers, which it could. Then, he headed \nto the Hall of Mirrors. \nA lot of the actual mirrors themselves were cracked or broken, making the \nmaze part of the funhouse easy to navigate, but he reckoned if he took the \ntime to sweep up the broken glass, it would still be serviceable. \nThen he came to a long, straight room that contained the warped mirrors. \nNow, to you and I, the undamaged pristine state of these would have a \nwarning sign. The fact that there was no dust on them at all, even after ten \nyears of neglect, would have rang all sorts of alarm bells. \nBut I’m trying to remind myself that not everyone is as attuned to these signs \nas we are, and to my young trespasser friend, apparently there was nothing in \nthat to worry him at all. In fact, he was excited to see them in such a good \nshape. \nI feel a little guilty. I actually laughed when he said that. \nIt was the third mirror that did it. The one that expanded him into a short, \nsquat reflection caused no problems. Neither did the one that bent him out of \nshape. But the third mirror, the one that squeezed him, made him thin and \ngaunt, that was the one which took him. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 156 – Reflection \nHe outright refused to tell me how exactly he was pulled through it, but from \nthe look in his eyes I have no doubt it was a powerfully unpleasant experience, \nso much so, that he claims to have lost consciousness. \nHe awoke to bright lights, and the sound of machines whirring, cut through \nwith ringing bells and the sound of people shouting. The lights in the Hall of \nMirrors were on, and it was clear that he was no longer in the old amusement \npark, seeing the place was changed from how he recalled it in the dark. \nEverything seemed more or less maintained, with paint that was old and \nstarting to peel, but a long way from the bare, rotten wood it had been before. \nThe only thing in worse condition were the mirrors themselves, the frames of \nwhich were now pocked with tiny, irregular indentations all the way round. It \nwould be some time before the idea would come to him that they were teeth \nmarks. \nOur witness staggered to his feet and quietly made his way towards the door \nof the funhouse, hanging off the side, so as to look out without being seen. \nThe park was completely changed, now seemingly full of life. There were \npeople striding down the main avenue, past the well-lit booths trying to entice \nthem with coconut throws and hoop games. The rollercoaster rattled along in \nthe background, the faint screams of its riders drifting over the crowds below. \nFor a few seconds it seemed almost legitimately joyful. \nBut as he watched, a certain wrongness began to become clear. \nMeaningless details, if they were confined to a single punter, but all the park-\ngoers seemed the same. \nThe first was how baggy their clothes were.
