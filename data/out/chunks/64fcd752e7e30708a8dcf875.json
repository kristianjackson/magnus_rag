Kill him and help me (dramatically) save the world. \n(Long beat) \nMARTIN \nNo. \n[Tape clicks off] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 158 – Panopticon \n \n22 \n[Tape clicks on] \n[The quiet room; with muffled violence in the background] \nDAISY \n(Sighing) Well? \nBASIRA \nLooks like two people. An old guy and— \nDAISY \nA woman with a scar. \nARCHIVIST \nOh, god, now? Why now?! \nBASIRA \nIt's probably not a coincidence. From what I saw they've been toying with the \nrest of the Institute, but it won't be long until they're all dead or escaped. \nDAISY \nAnd then they're coming here. \nARCHIVIST \n(Under his breath) Right. Okay. \nBASIRA \nSet up by the door. Try and take them when they break through. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 158 – Panopticon \n \n23 \nDAISY \nRight. \n[Movement as they take up positions] \nARCHIVIST \nDo ah... do I get a gun? \nBASIRA \nYou ever fired one? \nARCHIVIST \n(Indignant) You never taught me! \nBASIRA \nYou never asked. Besides, we've got problems enough without— \n[A loud bang of wood as a trapdoor bursts open] \n[Hissing static starts] \nNOT-SASHA \nHello, John. \nDAISY \nOh, shit. \nARCHIVIST \nYou gotta be fucking kidding— \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 158 – Panopticon \n \n24 \n[Loud crash of a door being kicked open; Daisy and Basira fire off \ntwo shots] \nBASIRA \nGo! \n[The team moves; not too far away is gunfire from Trevor and Julia; \nnearer is the clattering of Not-Sasha moving] \n[Hissing static ends] \nTREVOR \n(Calling, distant) Joooooonny boy! (cackles) \nJULIA \n(Calling, distant) (Laughing) We want to make a statement! \nNOT-SASHA \n(Distant) Oh, hello! What's happening here? New friends? \nTREVOR \n(Distant) What the— \n[Gunshots from Trevor and Julia] \n(Not-Sasha laughs) \nNOT-SASHA \n(Distant) Not new friends? Even better. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 158 – Panopticon \n \n25 \nDAISY \nWhat the hell is that thing? \nJULIA \n(Distant) Ha! You see that, old man? \nTREVOR \n(Distant) Told ya. They're all monsters here. \n[Gunfire and muffled destruction continues] \nARCHIVIST \nYou remember what happened to Sasha? \nBASIRA \nThat's the thing that took her. \nARCHIVIST \nIt was trapped in the tunnels. It— Martin. Something's happening down there. \nBASIRA \nIf he's down there with Peter, or Elias... dammit, we need to get down there. \nTREVOR \n(Distant) Come out, come out, wherever you are! (sniffs) You smell ‘im? \nJULIA \n(Distant) Ugh. Hard to tell over the stink of that thing! \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 158 – Panopticon \n \n26 \n[Gunfire and muffled destruction continues] \nDAISY \nThey'll follow us... \nBASIRA \nGod dammit. John, go, we'll keep them busy. \nARCHIVIST \nWhat? No! I— \nBASIRA \nDon't argue. Just go! \nNOT-SASHA \n(Distant) Joooohn? \nARCHIVIST \nFine. Just don't die. \nDAISY \nGo. \n[Sound of the Archivist running, fading out] \nBASIRA \nThis might be it. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 158 – Panopticon \n \n27 \nDAISY \nBasira... \nBASIRA \nDidn't think it would end like this. \n(Wry chuckling) You know what, actually, I think I did. \n(Not-Sasha laughs maniacally in the background) \n[Gunfire and muffled destruction continues] \nDAISY \nBasira, promise me something. \n(Daisy begins to breath rapidly and aggressively) \nBASIRA \nWhat? No — Daisy, no. \nDAISY \nBasira, when this is over, you need to find me. And kill me. Promise me. \nBASIRA \nNo. No, Daisy, we'll figure something out. \nNOT-SASHA \n(Closer) You can't hide forever, John... \nDAISY \nThese last months I... it was always borrowed time. Can't outrun it forever. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 158 – Panopticon \n \n28 \nBASIRA \nDaisy— \nDAISY \nPromise me! \nBASIRA \nI promise. \nDAISY \nThanks. Now run. \nBASIRA \nDaisy— \nDAISY \n(Voice growling, distorted by the Hunt) Run... \n[Quick footsteps as Basira leaves] \n(Daisy snarls out each breath) \n[Nearby, Julia cocks a gun] \nJULIA \nA-haha! There you are. \n[Trevor cocks a gun] \nTREVOR \nAll alone, little pup! \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 158 – Panopticon \n \n29 \n(Daisy’s snarls grow into a full-throated, attacking grow-bark) \nJULIA \nShit! \n[A gunshot rings out] \n[Tape clicks off] \n[Tape clicks on] \n[Faint sound of the Lonely static] \n[A large echoing space; the panopticon] \nPETER \nMartin. What are you doing? \nMARTIN \nI'm... saying no. I refuse. Game over. \n[The knife clatters to the ground] \nPETER \nMartin, this is not the time for petulance. There are bigger things at stake here. \nMARTIN \n(Laugh) You know, I think that was actually the problem. You made the stakes \ntoo high. All the little details that didn't add up... it made them more obvious. \nExaggerated.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 4, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 4484}}
