I've been wondering: did you know what you were \ndoing? \nJUDE \nExcuse me? \nARCHIVIST \nWhen you burned me. Marked me with… Did you know it would lead to, all of \nthis? \nJUDE \n(Unimpressed) You came all this way just to ask that? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 169 – Fire Escape \n20 \nARCHIVIST \nAnswer the question. \n(Martin coughs again) \nJUDE \nIf you want to know so badly, why don't you just reach into my head and pull it \nout? \nARCHIVIST \nBecause I want to hear you say it. Willingly. \nJUDE \nWhat difference does it make if— \nARCHIVIST \n(Snapping) Just answer the damn question! \n(Beat) \nJUDE \nNo. I had no idea. \nARCHIVIST \nSo why did you do it? \nJUDE \nWhy d'you think? Because I wanted to hurt you. \n(Martin coughs) \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 169 – Fire Escape \n21 \nBecause you were annoying and I didn't like you, so I hurt you. \nARCHIVIST \nAnd if you had known? \nJUDE \nBut I didn't. Look, I don't care, okay? \n(Martin keeps coughing) \nI just… I don't. Raking over the past like it matters, like it means anything. The \npast is dead, Archivist: ashes in the wind. \nWe're. Here. Now. And that's it. \nARCHIVIST \nI suppose you're right. \n(Martin coughs) \nJUDE \nSo the real question is: What happens now? \n[The fire rushes up in volume and intensity for a moment; there is \nan added continued sizzle to the inferno afterwards] \nMARTIN \nJohn, look out! \nJUDE \nWhat's wrong? Scared of a little flame? \n[Martin takes fear-filled breaths) \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 169 – Fire Escape \n22 \n(Delighted) Oh, you are, aren't you? (laugh) Pathetic. \nMARTIN \n(High) Screw you! \nARCHIVIST \nLeave him alone. \nJUDE \nYou're not scared, though, are you, Archivist? \nARCHIVIST \nI can feel the pain of every person you have trapped here. My own isn't all that \ndifferent. \nJUDE \nYeah, but you like seeing their pain, don't you? Their fear? \nARCHIVIST \n…Yes. \nJUDE \nYou and that stupid Eye; god, you make me sick! Lording it over everybody like \nyou own the place? You're just leeches. Voyeurs. \n[Additional sizzle gets intense for a moment] \nJUDE (CONT’D) \nParasites on the real monsters. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 169 – Fire Escape \n23 \nARCHIVIST \nEnough. \n(Beat) \nJUDE \nFine. Just messing around! \n[Additional sizzle ends] \nJUDE (CONT’D) \nWouldn't want to keep you from your oh-so-special business, your holiness. \nARCHIVIST \nI wouldn't worry about that: I'm right where I want to be. \nJUDE \nWhat's that supposed to mean? \nARCHIVIST \nI'm here for you, Jude. To end you. \nJUDE \nWhat? No! No way. \n(Martin's breath hitches, and then he's wheezing again) \nYou won. What would be the point of... You're bluffing. \nARCHIVIST \nYou know I'm not. You're already afraid. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 169 – Fire Escape \n24 \n[Distant building collapse] \nJUDE \nOh, I see. I get it. You finally get a sniff of power, and the first thing you do is \ntry to settle some old scores. \n(Martin coughs) \nPlay the big man; get off on some good old-fashioned petty revenge. \nARCHIVIST \n(Serious) I'd have thought that was a mindset you would appreciate. Now, feel \nit. All the terror and pain you've inflicted. \nJUDE \nOh, piss off— \n(She gasps) \nLook, look. Wait. Right? I'm sorry, okay? I shouldn't have burned your hand. \nARCHIVIST \nNo. You shouldn't have. \nJUDE \nPlease don't kill me, I, sure — \n(Martin coughs) \n— I moan about the Eye; who doesn't? But, we've won, both of us!
