Inhalation, alveoli, et cetera. \nAs I said, basic stuff, but I paused afterwards, just to have a think about where \nto go next, and I heard the sound of them breathing. That’s not abnormal, I \nknow, but it seemed to fill the silence so suddenly, and all at once. I could... I \ncould have sworn that I didn’t actually hear it before that moment. Like they’d \nonly just then started breathing. \n(Nervous laugh) \nWhich is, which is absurd, obviously. I was probably just listening out for it \nbecause we’d been discussing the lungs. Even so, it was disconcerting, and I \ndon’t mind telling you that I breathed quite a sigh of relief myself when the \ntutorial was over and I could get out of there. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG034 – Anatomy Class \n7 \n \nNow, I consider myself a conscientious worker, and in all my years at King’s I \ncan count on one hand the number of times I’ve called in sick, but when the \ntime came for the next tutorial with this class, I had to stay home with a \nmigraine. It wasn’t a lie, exactly, the thought of sitting there for another two \nhours with those staring, placid eyes gave me such a spell of anxiety that my \nbrain felt like it was being stabbed with a shard of ice. I did have to teach them \neventually, of course. I couldn’t avoid it forever. Re-entering that room, \nthough... All of them were sat in the exact same positions, in the exact same \nclothes, their breathing deliberate and almost pointed. When Erika \nMustermann – or was it Jan Novak? – said ‘Good morning’, the others followed \nsuit, one by one, and I had to fight the urge to run. It struck me then that, \ndespite how diverse their names were, none of them seemed to have any \nnoticeable accent. Not that it did anything to reassure me. \nThere was no-one else who could take the tutorials. Believe me, I did \neverything I could to try and find a replacement. Still, once I got used to their \nstares, their silence, and the fact that their questions were both specific and \noddly basic – one of the Petrovs once asked me “How sharp are the knees \nmeant to be” – I swear, it was just about tolerable. I’m a bit ashamed to admit \nit, but I came to terms with the fact that I didn’t care if they passed any exams, \nand that actually made the whole affair more manageable. I just did my best to \nstop caring. \nAnd then came our first of two sessions in the dissection room. We were \nlooking at the skeleton. I had been dreading this. Given exactly how creepy and \nunsettling the students were just sat in a classroom, the idea of what they \ncould do when given access to human remains made me feel quite nauseous. \nBut I couldn’t bring myself to leave them there alone, so I went. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG034 – Anatomy Class \n8 \n \nIt was even worse than I’d feared, seeing them stood there over the bits of \ncadaver. Their faces, normally so neutral, were alive with... what was it I saw? \nExcitement? Curiosity? Hunger? Whatever it was, it didn’t reach their eyes, still \nstaring and blank. I went through the procedures with them and tried my best \nto keep the trembling out of my voice. When Fulan reached for a scalpel and \nstarted cutting into our samples, I felt faint. \nI was trying to keep an eye on everyone, but the dissection tables were \narranged in a semi-circle around the lab, and each time I turned to face one of \nthe students, I began to hear this cracking sound from whichever tables I \nwasn’t looking at. Like a snapping bone, or a ribcage being forced open. I’d \nturn back and see nothing untoward, just John or Erika or Juan or whoever it \nwas, looking at me quizzically over distinctly unbroken bones. But it kept \nhappening. Whenever I wasn’t looking, I heard the crunch and the crack of \nbone. I couldn’t ask about it. I knew the dead-eyed, mute stare they’d give me \nif I did, and I just couldn’t face that. \nFinally, I managed to position myself so that I could see what was happening \nbehind me in the reflective edge of the metal table. It wasn’t much, but I could \nsee a slightly warped image. It was Pavel, in this case. I saw him pick up a bone \n– a radius I believe, from the forearm. He held it up next to his own arm, and \nthen there came that snapping, crunching noise. I swear I saw his arm distend \nitself, the skin shifting as something inside changed and rearranged, until it \nmatched the length of bone he was holding up to it. \nI tried not to react, not to make a noise at this mad impossibility that I saw. I \ncouldn’t help it, though, and my legs gave o", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 2, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 4500}}
