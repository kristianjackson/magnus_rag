It’s all a single moment, and there’s… there’s no difference between that \nlast moment that ushers us out into oblivion and the one we experience now. \nThe promise of a cold and lonely eternity in the grave would have been a \nmercy; at least it would be eternal. But everything ends, even the universe, \neven time. And… that means it has always already ended. \nI felt every feeling within me boil up: anger, despair, joy, hope, fear. Especially \nfear. They overwhelmed me, and burned up with the monumental realisation \nof the scale we existed on. Not the meaningless vastness of the universe, but \nthe… the smallness of it. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG094 – Dead Woman Walking \n10 \n \nAnd I realised I was in my bed. According to my phone, I had been for several \ndays. I numbly got myself some water, and ignored my weeping mother. She \ntried to hug me, but her arms just slid off my limp shoulders. \nAnd that was my life for several months. Eventually, the memory began to \nfade, and I started to feel again. I took the year out of university under the \numbrella of ‘medical reasons’, and by the time I met you I was, well, I don’t \nthink I’ll ever be the same person I was before, but I had started being able to \nactually live again. \nI never learned for sure what happened to the people in the Medical Science \nbuilding, or the dead woman. Someone said a police van and ambulance had \nturned up in the night, and taken them all away, but I couldn’t find anything \nmore on it. None of them came back to the university, and I never saw Alex \nagain. \nThere was one thing that never returned to me afterwards, though. Since that \nday, I’ve never been able to feel afraid. My fear’s just… gone. I’m not \nfoolhardy. I can still recognise danger, and I understand the likelihood of harm, \nbut actual fear? Simply not something I experience anymore. And I’ve never \nbeen able to figure out if it was cauterised, or… if it was stolen. \nGEORGIE \nSo that’s it. \nARCHIVIST \nI see. That, um… I mean, that – \nGEORGIE \nExplains some things? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG094 – Dead Woman Walking \n11 \n \nARCHIVIST \nA bit. I can’t believe you never told me. \nGEORGIE \nWell, I can’t believe you didn’t tell me you were on the run from the police \nover two murders, so… \nARCHIVIST \nNo, you – you’re right, I… \nGEORGIE \nAre you alright? You look like you’re about to keel over. \nARCHIVIST \nUh, no, I – I just… Ther-there’s been a lot of statements, in not a lot of time. \nI’m… I’m exhausted. I kind of wish I knew, uh, knew even one person who \ngenuinely wasn’t involved. \nGEORGIE \nMaybe that’s why you thought of me? \nARCHIVIST \nHm? \nGEORGIE \nI mean, it’s been years, and there must be other old friends you lost touch \nwith. Maybe you did know? \nARCHIVIST", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 4, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 2813}}
