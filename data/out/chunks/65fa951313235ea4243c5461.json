Are they a neutral \nparty, carting round whatever horror needs delivering, just a piece of \notherworldly infrastructure? Or are they fully part of the Stranger, just serving \nas allies of convenience for other things that need to be moved? \nMost importantly, though, it mentions a depot in Newcastle. Sasha checked on \nthe Nottingham depot when they first came up… huh, almost two years ago \nnow. A different time. But that had long been gentrified into luxury flats. Sasha \nnever mentioned there might have been other depots, and I never asked. I \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG093 – Contaminant \n9 \n \nneed to do some digging, because if the place is still there, if – if the building is \nstill standing, I might just have an idea where to – \n[The front door is unlocked and it opens.] \nEr… \n[Tape clicks off. Tape clicks on.] \nGEORGIE \nSo, what? You were just packing this away? \nARCHIVIST \nGeorgie, I just, I needed to do one more. \nGEORGIE \nI asked you not to record them here. \nARCHIVIST \nI’m sorry, I… I honestly forgot. It’s been a hell of a week. \nGEORGIE \nYeah, not just for you. What, you think you just disappear for five days, then \nturn up looking like the, like the end of Die Hard, and I’ll just write it off? \n‘Classic John, what an interesting life he must lead.’ \nARCHIVIST \nNo, I – \nGEORGIE \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG093 – Contaminant \n10 \n \nWhere have you been? And what happened to your hand? \nARCHIVIST \nI don’t want to talk about it. \nGEORGIE \nTough. \nARCHIVIST \nLook, I’m moving out anyway, so just… just forget it. I’m out of your life. \nAlright? \nGEORGIE \nNo. \nARCHIVIST \nNo… No, what? \nGEORGIE \nYou leave, you don’t get your tapes back. \nARCHIVIST \nWhat? \nGEORGIE \nWhen you disappeared, I took the tapes you recorded, and locked them away. \nHonestly, I thought I might need them as evidence. You want them back, you \ntell me what’s happening. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG093 – Contaminant \n11 \n \nARCHIVIST \nGeorgie, please… You’ll think I’m… You’ll think I’m delusional. \nGEORGIE \nI really hope so, John. Because right now I just think you’re a dickhead. \nARCHIVIST \nAlright. \n(Sigh) Okay. It started when I got that job at the Magnus Institute, you \nremember? \nGEORGIE \nYeah, they do… studies on ghosts and psychics and that, right? \nARCHIVIST \nMore or less. Well, I was hired as a researcher, and that was fine. I-I enjoyed it. \nNothing really paranormal, but life was… fine. It was good. \nThen, a couple of years ago, the Head of the Archives, Gertrude Robinson, she \ndisappeared, and Elias, my boss, chose me as her replacement. \nGEORGIE \nWhy? \nARCHIVIST \nWhat? \nGEORGIE \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG093 – Contaminant \n12 \n \nWhy would he give you that job? \nARCHIVIST \nUh… He thought I could do it? \nGEORGIE \nYou were a researcher, John – I mean, that’s, that’s a long way from an \narchivist. And I know you don’t just have a Library Science degree hanging \naround. \nARCHIVIST \nI – I mean it’s all the same… data and, and papers and stuff. Isn’t it? \nGEORGIE \nNot really. \nARCHIVIST \nUh… Well, I was given some assistants. Tim, Sasha, and Martin. They helped. \nGEORGIE \nWere any of them trained in Information Science? \nARCHIVIST \nI don’t… No? I mean, I haven’t even got to the weird bit yet. \nGEORGIE \nNow, I know you talk a good game, John, but hiring you out of the blue as an \narchivist is pretty weird. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG093 – Contaminant \n13 \n \nARCHIVIST \nHead Archivist. \nGEORGIE \nWell that does make sense, actually. In context. \nARCHIVIST \nI’m not sure I follow? \nGEORGIE \nWhat I mean is, if there’s no-one above you, there’s no-one to point out you’re \ndoing everything wrong. \nARCHIVIST \nLook, can we put my professional competence to one side, please. Because I’m \ntrying to tell you monsters are real! \nGEORGIE \nOkay. \nARCHIVIST \nOkay? Okay, what? \nGEORGIE \nOkay, I know monsters are real and I… assume there’s more? \nARCHIVIST \nI… erm, you, you know?", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 4, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 4050}}
