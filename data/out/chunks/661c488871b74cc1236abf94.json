I snapped back that we weren’t lost at all, that I’d followed the \nmap exactly, and she just gave me this look like she didn’t understand what I \nwas talking about. I shrugged and told her that I would go first on the way \nback, and she agreed. I was eager to get back and be above ground in a way \nthat I had never been before. I got my equipment ready and dived back into \nthe water, heading back towards Death’s Head Hole. \nThat’s when everything started to go really, really wrong… \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG015 – Lost John’s Cave \n9 \n \nTo begin with, the water didn’t end. I tried to surface, as I had on my first time \nthrough, and again there was that clunk as my helmet hit the roof of the \ntunnel. I moved on and tried again, but still no luck. I began to fight down the \nrising alarm, told myself that the tunnel had a definite end and I just had to \nreach it, but it just kept going. No light, no surface, nothing but this cramped \nwaterway, pressing on every side waiting to claim me. I don’t know how long I \nwas desperately swimming forward, but I almost screamed with relief when I \nreached my hand and felt it break the surface of the water. \nIt wasn’t the cave I expected. What stretched before me was a tunnel even \nsmaller than the waterlogged one I had left. I scrambled forward into it, not \nbecause I wanted to go on into that unknown passage, but because I was \nworried about Alena being able to get out of the water behind me. I must have \ntaken a wrong turn except that didn't make sense. I hadn't turned at all, and \nmore than that, there weren't any turns or junctions in this part of the cave. I \nhad checked all the maps of this area over and over and they all put it as a \nstraight line. I waited, wanting to talk to my sister when she surfaced, and \ndiscuss where to go from here. She didn't emerge. I don't know how long I lay \nthere; it was too cramped to check the time, but it felt like hours. I wanted to \ngo back and check, but I couldn't even turn around to see. I just waited for a \nsplash that never came. \nI decided to go on, press forward until I at least found somewhere wide \nenough that I could turn. As crawled on, I scraped against the jagged rocks \nuntil I felt them pressing into my bare skin where my clothes had ripped. I can \ndeal with it when I'm out, I kept thinking, but the passage just got smaller and \nsmaller, until at last I couldn’t move any further. I finally accepted that I was \ngoing to have to try and squeeze back the way I had come without even", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 5, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 2727}}
