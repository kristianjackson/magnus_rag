I \ngenerally avoid horror and I tend to stay off rollercoasters in the rare situation \nI have a chance to ride them. So I was as surprised as anyone that this \nundeniably sinister figure wasn’t causing me more distress. I mean, I was a bit \nnervous, sure. I’ve never had any direct experience with the supernatural \nbefore and the more I looked and checked and double-checked, the more sure \nI was that supernatural was exactly what it was. To be honest, I was surprised \nhow quickly I accepted that. I’ve always considered myself a bit of a sceptic, \nand until recently I’d have said working at the Institute only made me more so. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG026 – A Distortion \n5 \n \nAnyway, I watched it for about ten minutes, until the blond man bought a \nsmall bunch of lilies and walked away. Once he was gone, the distorted figure \nwith the long hands disappeared as well. I headed down into the street and \nover to the flower shop. The woman working there gave me a bit of a confused \nlook when I asked if there had just been a tall, blond man in her shop. She said \nyes there had, and no, she hadn’t noticed anything strange, and was I looking \nto buy some flowers. I was quite confused myself, and on a bit of an edge \nwhen I left. I was already late for work, though, so I decided to ignore it and \njust keep an eye out. \nSure enough, it wasn’t too long before I saw him again. There’s a small café I \ngenerally pop into when I head to work in the morning. I love the Institute’s \nbuilding, of course, it’s beautiful, but from a money point of view, I really wish \nit wasn’t in Chelsea. Everything around here is so expensive. I generally walk \ndown from Victoria Station. It’s a long walk, but quite pretty, and it gives me a \nchance to pick up a coffee on the way. As I said, I was running late that \nmorning, so I was a bit conflicted about whether to get one, but as I looked in \nthe window I saw a familiar figure at one of the corner tables. Again, the blond \nguy wasn’t looking in my direction, nor did he seem to give any indication that \nhe was aware of my existence. He was there, though, and I was on the verge of \nwalking in and confronting him when I noticed the time and decided getting to \nwork was more important. Besides, what’s that old saying? “Once is \nhappenstance, twice is coincidence, three times is enemy action”. I decided \nthat if he turned up a third time, then I would ask him… something. I don’t \nreally know what I was planning to ask him. “Are you secretly a monster?” \nprobably would have been a great opener. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG026 – A Distortion \n6 \n \nWhen I got here, I realised I needn’t have worried so much about the time. You \nwere having some argument with Tim about… um, oh, who’s that architect \nhe’s obsessed with? \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nRobert Smirke. \n \nSASHA \nYeah, that’s the one. So, I was starting to regret not getting a coffee and talking \nto tall, blond and monster, since it didn’t seem like I’d have missed much. I got \non with my work, did some filing, cross-checked a few statements with police \nincident reports. I mean, I guess I don’t need to tell you what a day working in \nthe archives entails. It was a quiet day, aside from when Martin thought he \nsaw one of those silver worms and we spent half an hour checking for it. \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nYes. I remember. \n \nSASHA \nCome on, it’s not his fault he’s being stalked by some weird living hive. \n \nJONATHAN SIMS", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 2, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 3500}}
