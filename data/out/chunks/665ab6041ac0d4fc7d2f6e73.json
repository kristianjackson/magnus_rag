And one of those duties \nwas checking on the cargo, making sure none of the breakables had managed \nto, well, break. Any other crew I’d have been worried about theft, but I’d been \nwith most of these for two or three years, so there plenty of trust there. \nThis must have been some time in September, back in ‘99, and for most of the \njourney Cook had been checking on the merchandise with no problem at all. \nBut on the last week or so of that voyage, he’d been taking longer and longer, \nand it was starting to affect meal times, and so on one of those occasions I \nmade my way down to check on him. And, of course, I found him staring into \none of the boxes. \n\nThe item in question that we were transporting for sale was an old antique \nmeat grinder. The sort with a heavy vice you clamp on the table, and a nice big \ncrank for twisting the screw, push the meat from the funnel along and into the \nmincer. It was a rusty old thing, all heavy iron and brand names worn away to \nnothing. If it wasn’t for the fact that it was near two hundred years old it would \nhave been more valuable as scrap. Even with the age I wasn’t confident we \ncould shift it. Without looking at my records, I couldn’t tell you where I picked \nit up, and I’m sure it wasn’t pointed out to me as one of the weirder items. No \nwarnings or nothing like that. \nBut Cook, he couldn’t get enough of it. He was staring at the thing, a look of \nlonging in his eyes. \nWith another decade under my belt, I now know how stupid my next action \nwas, but I used to consider myself someone who looks after my crew, and \nCook seemed real taken with the thing. I honestly wasn’t sure how well it was \ngoing to sell anyway, so I named a fair price and offered to take it out of his \nwages if he wanted to claim the grinder for his own. He said yes immediately, \nand was mighty thankful of my generosity. He grabbed the thing like it weighed \nnothing at all, which was the first clue I took proper notice of, and sprinted off \nto make lunch. \nThat night dinner was hamburgers. I made a joke to Cook about him getting \ngood use out of the meat grinder already, and he laughed, told me it was from \nfrozen, but looking back now I don’t think he laughed as long or as hard as I \nmight have liked. The meat was good, juicy, and honestly it didn’t taste as if it \nhad been frozen at all. The sausages the next night were the same. \n\nCook was different as well. Whenever I passed him I got a little bit of a smell. \nLike a raw steak just hitting the grill. Not an unpleasant smell, not at all, but \ncertainly one I’d never noticed on him before. Occasionally, if he was wearing \nwhite, I could see small spots or smears of blood just at the edges. It might \nhave been his own, working on a ship you get your share of cuts, but after a \ncouple of days it became a little bit on the… unnerving side. He smiled more as \nwell, and I’m not sure, but I feel like that might have been the thing that tipped \nme off the most that something was up with him. He’d never been the sort to… \nsmile. \nThe meaty dinners kept coming, and I was began to wonder a bit about where \nhe was getting it all. I talked to Leigh about it, who generally deals with \nsupplies and acts as a sort of quartermaster, and she told me she’d definitely \nstocked up on plenty of canned and frozen meats for Cook before we set out, \nthough only he’d been keeping track of what we actually had left. \nBut it wasn’t that I thought he didn’t have the meat available, it’s that I just \ndidn’t know how he seemed to make it all taste so fresh. By that point I was \npretty much convinced that whatever was going on with Cook was outside the \narea of the natural, and that usually traced back to one of the items I was \ncarrying for sale. The fact that I’d just given something to Cook, well it tracked \ntoo closely for me to not come to some… obvious conclusions. \nI started to avoid eating the meat I was served, kept my feeding to the small \nportion of vegetables that he’d add to the side, more a garnish than anything \nelse. It didn’t escape my notice that Cook was also hiding increasing amounts \nof his arm inside his coat when he spoke to me.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 1, "chunk_count": 5, "chars": 4198}}
