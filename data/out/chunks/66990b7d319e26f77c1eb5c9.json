And we \nhave all the time in the world to do so. \n[Creak and fabric movements from a bed] \n[The doctor walks to the door and opens it; the hospital sounds \nseem distorted and there is a distant screaming multitude] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nGood night. \n[Door closes and all SFX stop for a beat] \n[The door opens and closes with a heavy latch sound of a church \ndoor; the hospital and screaming multitude are heard again] \n[A clock ticks louder] \n[Footsteps as the doctor arrives] \n[After the door closes, the distant sound of screams can still be \nheard alongside a clownish laugh] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nAh, good morning. How are we feeling today? \n[Short creak and fabric movements from a bed] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 177 – Wonderland \n29 \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nHm? Oh, no it’s just me. Call me Doctor David. \n[Creak and fabric movements from a bed] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nNo, I’m pretty sure I’ve always had this face. \n[Short creak and fabric movements from a bed] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nOh, I see, another of your lies, is it, as though I haven’t heard enough of them \nin the, what, five years I’ve been treating you now. No matter. \n[Short creak and fabric movements from a bed] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nYes, five years, can we please not start that again? \nDid you sleep well? Hm? \n[Short creak and fabric movements from a bed] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nWell, that makes sense I suppose. Nightmares are to be expected from a mind \nlike yours. \n[Short creak and fabric movements from a bed] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nOoh, monsters, you say? You must have gotten a look at Brian the orderly. \n(Long chuckling that is mirthless with a touch of manic) \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 177 – Wonderland \n30 \nI joke, of course. You seem fine, though, so I’m sure whatever that silly little \nimagination of yours concocted, it can’t have been all that bad. \n[Creak and fabric movements from a bed] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nOh, yes? More ‘hallucinations’? Hm, well, you can describe them to me if you \nlike, I’m certain they’re quite horrible. But on other hand, they didn’t happen, \nyou’re lying, and everyone wishes you’d just stop making a fuss. You \nremember your mother, what you made her do because you just couldn’t be \nbothered to pull yourself together? \n[Short creak and fabric movements from a bed] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nYes, of course it was your fault, we’ve been over this quite extensively in our \nearlier sessions. Or are you still pretending not to remember? \n[Creak and fabric movements from a bed] \n[Screams and clownish laugh increasing in volume] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nI really wish you’d stop saying that. We don’t really like the word ‘mad’ in \nWonderland House. Because you’re not. You never have been. \n[Creak and fabric movements from a bed] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nYou just need to… Oh do calm down you hysterical little creep. Throwing \nanother tantrum will get you nowhere here. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 177 – Wonderland \n31 \n[Sounds of movement, something fall to the floor] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nOh violence, is it? Very original. Just do be careful not to— \n[Sounds of motion, a scuffle, then flesh peeling] \n[Dripping noises, then something wet drops to the floor] \n(Beat) \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nWell, I hope you’re happy. \n[Panicked footsteps and motion] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nWell, what did you expect to be under my face? \n[A wooden bang] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nYou really should stop screaming, you’re only upsetting yourself. \n[Fabric movement] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nOf course it’s real, it’s absolutely real. I’ve told you, you’re quite sane. You just \nneed to admit it, and then we can get on with things. \nNo rush, though, like I say. We have all the time in the world. \n[Hissing static starts] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 177 – Wonderland \n32 \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nAnd good old Doctor David isn’t going anywhere. \n[Sounds of the hospital corridors return] \n[Hissing static ends] \n(Deep exhalation from the Archivist) \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nSatisfied? \nBASIRA \nFuck. \n[Tape clicks off] \n[Tape clicks on] \n[Footsteps echo in one of hospital’s corridors, the same repeating \ntinny muzak plays and background sounds continue] \nBASIRA \nNo, I get that bit, it’s just... So the guy was mad, or...? \nARCHIVIST \nNo it-it… I mean, yes. It’s sort of, like… gaslighting, but in reverse. This place, \nit’s built on the fear that your mental health problems aren’t actually real. \nBASIRA \nWouldn’t that be a good thing?", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 6, "chunk_count": 10, "chars": 4413}}
