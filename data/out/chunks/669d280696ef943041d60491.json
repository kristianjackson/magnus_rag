I… \ndo not know how I feel about this. \nSix: Actions that should be taken. \nNone. Even if such a fate could be avoided, as it comes closer and the other \nentities grow in their awareness of their own end, the grotesque ripples of \ntheir own impossible panic shall glut and feed my master, gorging it to the \npoint where perhaps it will even surpass the Watcher in prominence. The \nothers may take what actions they wish; they may plot and plan and tear \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 168 – Roots \n17 \nthemselves apart in an attempt to separate from the fate that they know they \ncannot escape, but they will fail. The currents of perception and reality may \ntwist in whatever shapes they want, but none of them can ever render things \ntruly eternal. \nAnd I shall help, ushering on this final, blank emptiness. Perhaps once it might \nhave horrified me, or given me some sense of pursuing the ultimate release of \nthe world that you have damned. But I am too much of my patron now, and \nmy feelings cannot help but reflect the shadows of anticipation that lurk within \nthe grave. The End does not fear its own cessation, for it is the certainty and \npromise of all life, however strange, that it will one day finish, and that \nincludes its own stark existence. It shall be the last and, when the universe is \nsilent and still forever, it shall, perhaps, in that impossible moment before it \nvanishes, finally be satisfied. \nSeven: Your response. \nPlease, John, do not interpret this report as a plea for mercy or a call to action. \nI would have offered it willingly, of course, but to do so is no longer an option. \nYou cannot ask. You may only take. And so the scope of my domain is yours. \nEnter it and destroy me, if you wish. I fear the annihilation you would gift me \nas little as I desire it. \nI am now, as the thing I feed, a fixed point, that has neither the longing nor the \nability to change its state of existence. \nI can do nothing to you, and you may walk the corpse roots in safety should \nyou choose, though if you wish to confront me, you will have to seek me out. \nYou know, of course, where I am. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 168 – Roots \n18 \nBut know that- even you, with all your power, cannot keep the world alive \nforever. All things end, and every step you take, whatever direction you may \nchoose, only brings you closer to it. \nReport ends. \n[Hissing static start] \n(The Archivist exhales heavily) \n[Hissing static ends] \n[The whispers and wooden creaks of the corpse roots continue] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nLot to think about. I-I feel… \nNo. I don't want to destroy Oliver Banks. It wouldn't do any good. I know that, \nand he never asked for this any more than I did. \nI feel badly for those that exist in his domain, o-of course, I do, but… at least \ntheir suffering will be over. Eventually. I can't destroy everyone I cross paths \nwith, it— (sigh) No. If Oliver will not seek me out then, I will leave him be. \n(Quiet laugh) The Avatar of Death shall live.
