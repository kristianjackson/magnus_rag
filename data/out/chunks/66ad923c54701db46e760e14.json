He looked at me for a long, off-putting second as a wide smile crept \nacross his face. “I know it’s been a long time, Lawrence,” he said, “but surely \nyou haven’t forgotten your cousin Carl?” \nWhat are you supposed to say to that? I just sort of stammered and wandered \noff. I didn’t realise exactly what was happening until I asked my brother who \nthe stranger was, and he gave me a puzzled look and told me, yes, that was \nCarl, my cousin. I assumed he must be playing some sort of joke, but the whole \nthing had really kind of unsettled me, so I asked my father, and he said the \nsame thing. Now, my father is not somebody who jokes. He’s never been one \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG078 – Distant Cousin \n4 \n \nfor humour and I can count on one hand the number of times I’ve ever heard \nhim properly laugh. There was no way he would play along in any sort of prank \nAdam might try to arrange. I looked over, and the person who claimed to be \nmy cousin was staring at me, smiling wide enough to show off rows of yellow-\nstained teeth. \nI could feel panic beginning to rise in my chest, and I started asking everyone \nwho might know Carl, and all of them told me the same thing. When my aunt \ngave me a withering glare for asking who her son was, I had to leave. I just \nwalked out of the hall, got in my car and drove back to London. I don’t drink, so \nit definitely wasn’t that. I thought maybe I was having some sort of dissociative \nepisode. That must have been it. I’d been under a lot of stress at work, and my \nown marriage had recently ended, so perhaps that had affected me more than \nI thought. Maybe it had done something to my memory. I even managed to \nhalf-convince myself that if I was having a nervous breakdown and all that \nmeant was I misremembered a cousin I never see, I’d gotten off quite lightly. \nBut I couldn’t let it go. It nagged at me. As I lay awake in my too-empty bed, it \ntwisted in my mind. I wasn’t just remembering Carl wrong. I did not know the \nperson who was using his name. It wasn’t Carl. It just wasn’t. \nI was signed off work at the time, and mostly spent my days just kicking around \nthe house, but a about a week after the wedding it occurred to me that, when \nmy grandmother passed away a few years before, my parents had asked me to \ngo through her old photos, see which ones we might like to keep. I’d taken \nthem, but had never actually gotten around to going through them, and they \nshould still be in the loft. Not having anything better to do, and still a little bit \noff-balance after Adam’s wedding, I pulled down the ladder, and went to fetch \nthem.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 1, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 2738}}
