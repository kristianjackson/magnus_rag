And \nwherever there were words that might give me comfort, I found them \nobscured by dark stains. The bile began to rise within my throat again, and I \ndesperately wanted to hurl the book away from me. I held it, though, for just a \nmoment before I placed the small volume once again in my jacket. It took \nmore willpower than I could have believed, but I kept it. I stood up shakily, and \nstaggered back to the presbytery. \nI slept for a long time, and missed morning Mass, saying I was feeling unwell. It \nwasn’t a lie, of course; I just lay there for hours. There seemed a safety in \nstillness, as though inaction could do no harm. It was the first good decision I \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG020 – Desecrated Host \n3 \n \nhad made, and there isn’t day goes by I don’t curse myself for ever rising from \nthat bed. Nobody bothered me – I think word had gotten round that I was \nhaving a difficult time and they were almost certainly trying to decide who \nwould be best to talk to me, or even whether to ask the Bishop to intervene. \nI decided that I needed to talk to Father Singh. I didn’t think that he would be \nable to help me, but he was at least familiar with Bethany O’Connor’s case. \nPerhaps he might have some insight into what was happening. I tried to find \nhim quickly – the faces on each crucifix and painting I passed seemed to twist \nand sneer at me as I walked and my head was throbbing. The painted blood \nglistened as though still wet. I’m glad I didn’t encounter anyone, for I was \nstaggering so much they would likely have thought I was drunk. \nFinally I found Father Singh in the small chapel. He seemed surprised to see me \nand as I approached, his face fell and he backed away ever so slightly. I can’t \nimagine how bad I must have looked to get such a reaction from him, but I sat \nnext to him anyway. I began to talk, to tell him everything that had happened. \nHe remained silent as I spoke, until I began to talk about the exorcism I had \ntried to perform on Bethany. He held up his hand, and asked if I’d prefer to \nspeak about it in confession. I was momentarily confused, and asked him what \nsin he felt I had committed. He looked at me, and I swear there was almost a \nsmile on his face when he spoke. “Spiritual pride,” he said, “that has led to \nquite a fall.” \nUnsettled though I was at his attitude, I could not deny that he was right. I \nagreed, and we left the chapel. Soon I was giving my account as a full \nconfession, and I could not keep from crying as I described what happened \nwhen I attempted to lay a blessing upon that house on Hill Top Road. I finished \nmy account, and waited for Father Singh to speak of my penance or absolution. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG020 – Desecrated Host \n4 \n \nInstead, he paused for a few moments, then said, “No, your sins are deeper \nthan that.” And he began to list them. \nEvery transgression I had made since I was six years old. The disabled child I \nhad bullied in primary school, the time I stole money from my mother’s purse \nto buy cigarettes, the indiscretions I had had at the seminary. All of them. I had \nconfessed them each before and been absolved, but not to Father Singh, and \nto hear them thrown back in my face as such a stark list of wickedness rattled \nme deeply. I noticed something else as he spoke: Father Singh only emigrated \nfrom Jaipur a decade or so before I met him, and he had always had quite a \nstrong accent but the voice that spoke now to read my litany of wrongdoing \nhad no trace of it. It was a clipped and crisp RP accent, though in tone it \nseemed to match that of my friend. \nI leapt to my feet and ran from the room, and towards the front door. I needed \nto get out, to get somewhere I could breathe. In the hallway I ran past two \nother priests, who looked more worried than ever. One of them was Father \nSingh. \nIt was dark when I left the presbytery. I had no idea where I was going or why; I \njust had the desperate need to be somewhere else. The streets of Oxford \nshould have been full of drunken students at that time on a Sunday night, at \nleast, I thought it was Sunday, but they were almost deserted. Occasionally, I \nwould see figures standing or walking at the end of the narrow streets, but \nthey were shadowy, silhouetted against what little light there was, and were \nalways gone when I approached. I tried once again to pray but the words died \non my tongue. I have never felt despair on the sheer scale I did at that \nmoment.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 1, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 4489}}
