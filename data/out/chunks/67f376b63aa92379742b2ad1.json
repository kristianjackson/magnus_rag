Georgie didn’t do anything! \nGEORGIE \nNo, Melanie, I, I didn’t. \nMELANIE \n(Softly) Yeah. \nGEORGIE \nAnd maybe I should have. I kept out of it, even when I got a pretty good idea of \nwhat was going on towards the end. But… (sighing) I should have known \nbetter. Hiding never helps. \nMELANIE \nIt keeps you alive. \nGEORGIE \nFor a while! But… we couldn’t actually do anything, could we? Couldn’t save \nanyone. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 199 – Seeing it Through \n8 \nBASIRA \nOkay, fine, blame for everyone. \n[Basira takes a few steps] \nBASIRA (CONT’D) \nBut the hard fact is, John’s the only one who can take over the Panopticon. \nMARTIN \nWould you stop just putting everything on him? \nGEORGIE \nWhich brings us to our third option. \nARCHIVIST \nWhich is? \nGEORGIE \nDo nothing. We... adapt to the new world, and just wait for it to finally end. \nARCHIVIST \nLeaving everyone to just suffer until the Powers burn out? \nMARTIN \nYou said yourself that even if you did take over you couldn’t stop the suffering. \nIf we keep it all trapped here, it’s gonna be hell either way. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 199 – Seeing it Through \n9 \nBASIRA \nIt’s alright for us though, isn’t it? We’re not the ones trapped in our worst \nnightmares. \nMELANIE \nWhat’s your point? \nBASIRA \nDo we actually have the right to make this decision? The five of us? For the \nwhole world, or for maybe infinite worlds we know nothing about? \nGEORGIE \nNo, of course we don’t. But we’re the ones here. And I doubt there’s anyone \nelse out there who’s in a better position to decide. \nARCHIVIST \nThere isn’t. \nGEORGIE \nSo, we’re the ones that have to make the call, and we need to acknowledge \nthat doing nothing is still on the table as an option. \n(Basira exhales) \nBASIRA \nWe could ask them. \nGEORGIE \nWho? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 199 – Seeing it Through \n10 \nBASIRA \nThe people trapped in the domains. The ones actually doing the suffering. Why \ndon’t we see what they want? \nARCHIVIST \n(Pained) Because I already know. They want it to stop. \nBut to try and explain it all to them, give them enough context for them to \nmake an actual, meaningful choice... I don’t think it’s possible while they’re still \ntrapped. They’re too much a part of their domains. \nBASIRA \nSo we bring them out. \nYou’ve rescued people before, we can do it again. \nGEORGIE \nTrue... \nMARTIN \nS-Sure, but we can’t bring everyone out. So then, all we’re actually doing is \ndeciding who makes the call with even less understanding than us. \nMELANIE \nRight? It’s kind of shitty to bring them out just to ask them if they’re willing to \nsacrifice themselves for the greater good. \nMARTIN \nMmm. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 199 – Seeing it Through \n11 \nBASIRA \nShittier than just making the decision for them? \nMELANIE \nIf the decision is to do it, maybe they’d be grateful we saved them the guilt. \nMARTIN \nIf it’s just a matter of guilt, then I’ll take it right now. I’d rather live the rest of \nmy life lying awake wondering if I made the right choice, over lying awake \nlistening to the screams of everyone on Earth being tortured! \nARCHIVIST \n(Angry) What? So it’s better for a thousand times more people to scream as \nlong as we can’t hear them? \nMARTIN \nNo! Because Annabelle said it wouldn’t be like that. Wherever they go, it’ll be \nlike it was here before, with the Powers just lurking on the edges. \nMELANIE \nAnd our world survived like that for... for what, all of history? \nMARTIN \nMmmm. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 199 – Seeing it Through \n12 \nMELANIE \nSure, it’s not great, but it’s, it’s not like those other realities won’t have bad \nstuff happening already. We all lived with monsters in the shadows, and we \njust got on with it. \nBASIRA \nYeah, until we didn’t, until the ritual kicked off. What’s to stop the same thing \nhappening in these other worlds? \nMARTIN \nIt, it took like millennia of failed rituals before this happened. That means there \nhas to be a chance that it won’t happen at all, right? \n[Georgie’s chair creaks] \nGEORGIE \nMaybe. \nMELANIE \nAnd if it does happen, it will be because of the actions of the people in those \nother dimensions, just like here it was because of— \nARCHIVIST \nMe. \nMELANIE \nBecause of us. \n(Beat)", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 1, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 4480}}
