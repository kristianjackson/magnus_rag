It can be \nhaunted by something, some crime or atrocity that indelibly marked itself \nupon the soul of a spot. But can it be haunted by somewhere? An echo of \nworlds that are not our own, alien pasts that draw to unknown presents, \nleaking through the smallest, narrowest crack at the very edge of existence? \nThe closest anyone ever came to knowing was a man named Geoffrey Neckam, \na scholar from the University. He bought the house that then sat there from a \nbow-legged milliner whose name he never bothered to learn, seeking some \npeace and removal from his more raucous colleagues. He was a man of God, of \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 196 – This Old House \n \n13 \ncourse, but also a keen master of natural philosophy, a study he put to use \nwhen he first felt the oddities that pervaded his new home — the strange \ndraughts that shifted his candle flame, the gentle murmur that almost sounded \nlike voices. Once he even found a new room, though he very wisely did not \nenter it. \nHis investigations were crude, of course, convinced as he was that it was some \nworking of his god; an unseen passage to a heavenly sphere, perhaps, or, as he \nmore often feared, an infernal one. That said, his observations were \nsurprisingly astute, and his rubric of belief closer to the truth than you might \nimagine. But Geoffrey Neckam had neither the words to talk of dimensions, \nnor a mind able to meaningfully conceive of worlds beyond the one within \nwhich he lived, and its requisite afterlives of course. And so, as a result all his \nmediations and his intellect ultimately lead him nowhere. \nThey were not, however, entirely in vain. Because, you see, Geoffrey Neckam \nlived in fear. There was a reason he chose to live apart from his peers, why he \ncooked his own paltry meals in privacy, and avoided academic meetings. He \nwas certain that his scholastic rivals were somehow plotting against him, \nweaving intricate schemes to ruin his reputation and cost him his position, \neven take his life. It was this obsession that first brought him to the attention \nof Mother-of-Puppets, the Great Spider, and how we became aware of what \nthis place was. What it might mean. \nEventually, the long-awaited knife in the dark did indeed find its way into the \nbelly of Geoffrey Neckam. But by then his only meaningful work was done, and \nanother, altogether grander plan, was now in motion. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 196 – This Old House \n \n14 \nIt was no easy task, keeping the place close through the ages, working all the \nwhile to weaken that crack, luring in the servants of other powers, and so in \nthe resulting clash, pressing ever harder against the edges of our reality. \nFor a while it belonged to a sculptor of puppets, who made his strings from the \ntendons of those he felt did not appreciate his art, and he would dance them \naround in a mocking effigy. He was, in time, slain by a crusading hunter of the \nReformation, who would let no heresy go unanswered. He was bisected with \nhis own wood saw. \nOnce there lived there a writer of anonymous letters, who could not have told \nyou where his secrets came from, only that he knew the darkest desires of \nmany souls, and had the wit to use them to their best effect. He was deemed a \ncivil war traitor and buried alive deep beneath the house in which he had \ndrawn his schemes by a man whose teeth were always stained with mud. \nSo many schemers and spiders and full-throated monsters. Twisting \nmanipulators and furtive liars. Each meeting a violent, grotesque end; each \nwidening the crack just a little. Until finally, a man named Raymond Fielding, a \nsmiling pillar of the community who fostered children into food for his \ngrotesque arachnid god, was murdered by flame, immolated by the chosen of \nthe Ravening Burn. The house of the time was destroyed along with him, \nreduced to ashes, and with that the crack finally became... a gap. \n[An unusual wood creak] \nMARTIN (CONT’D) \nA hole around which time, dimension and reality began to bend, shudder and \nleak.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 3, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 4107}}
