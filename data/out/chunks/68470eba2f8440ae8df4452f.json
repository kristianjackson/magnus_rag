Audio recording by Jonathan Sims, \nH-Head Archivist of the Magnus Institute, London. \nStatement begins. \nARCHIVIST (STATEMENT) \nMy father-in-law was always a fastidious man. When we first met, I made \nsome jokes about OCD, but a few warning looks from Dani shut me right up. \nGreg Russell was very tidy and very clean, but balanced out, I always thought, \nby his wife Sandra, my mother-in-law. I know I’m meant to hate my mother-in-\nlaw, but honestly Sandra and I got on fantastically. Both of us were kind of \nmessy, and found the chaos comforting and homely, and we had very similar \nsenses of humour. I never figured out whether she and Greg complemented \neach other, or drove each other up the wall. When I first met them I was \nhorrified by the way they talked to each other, convinced I was about to \nwitness the messy divorce of my girlfriend’s parents. But twelve years later, \nthey were still together, and I found myself privy to their more tender \nmoments. To be honest, I’m still not sure how healthy their relationship was, \nbut it seems to work for them, and Danielle, my wife, didn’t seem to have \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG093 – Contaminant \n3 \n \ninherited any of their more confrontational habits when it came to our \nrelationship. \nAll in all, I enjoyed seeing them two or three times a year on holidays, but was \nkind of glad they lived all the way up in Newcastle. Dani would talk to them on \nthe phone for hours, and I’d get all the updates, but crucially, I didn’t have to \ndo much of the interaction myself. And that was more than enough for me. \nThen, last year, the… unthinkable happened. Hereditary conditions, right? \nThey… They can really ruin… everything. The doctors told us the chances of it \nhappening were astronomical, like we should be proud of having something so \nunlikely march in and ruin our lives, but within ten months both myself and \nGreg were widowers. I think I must have spent more nights that year in \nhospital chairs than I did in my own bed. But November rolled around, and I \nhad it all to myself. You don’t realise how big a bed can be until something like \nthat happens. \nI don’t really know what I expected it to do to my relationship with my father-\nin-law. I mean, I didn’t really expect anything at all. If you’d asked me at the \ntime, I probably would have said that it should have brought us closer \ntogether, that we’d probably end up leaning on each other for support. But \nthat never really happened. Instead, he stopped contacting me completely. He \nstill answered the phone when I called, but was polite when I went to check \nupon him. Every bit of communication had to be instigated by me. \nAnd he had gotten… cleaner. I didn’t think it was possible, but every time I \nwent over there, the smell of bleach was almost overwhelming. More often \nthan not he was wearing rubber cleaning gloves when he opened the door, and \nas I walked around I could feel his eyes making note of everywhere I walked,", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 0, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 4301}}
