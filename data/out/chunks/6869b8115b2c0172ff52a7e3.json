Op-our mum. Whatever! \nALSO MARTIN \n(Emphatically) And we’re glad she’s dead. \nMARTIN \nJesus... \nALSO MARTIN \nToo much? Like I said, I’m a bit more open. \nMARTIN \nI— \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 186 – Quiet \n \n13 \nALSO MARTIN \nDon’t lie. You don’t need to. Not here. It’s just us. \n(Heavy sigh from Martin) \nMARTIN \nIf we’re glad, why do I feel so... \nALSO MARTIN \nGuilty? \nBecause you feel guilty about everything. \nMARTIN \nThat’s… That’s not— \nALSO MARTIN \nYour mother. \nMARTIN \nStress is a proper factor in a stroke— \nALSO MARTIN \nEverything that’s happened to John. \nMARTIN \nI brought Jane Prentiss to the Institute! \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 186 – Quiet \n \n14 \nALSO MARTIN \nThe end of the entire world? \nMARTIN \nIf I’d done what Peter had asked... If-If I’d not chickened out, and just killed \nElias when I had the chance… \nALSO MARTIN \nReally? Really, that’s how you’re choosing to remember it? Chickening out? \nMARTIN \nI remember it was the wrong choice. \nALSO MARTIN \nYou choose to remember it that way, and so the guilt— \nMARTIN \nI get it, alright? But I need it. I-I choose the guilt, because… \nALSO MARTIN \n(Leading) Because… \nMARTIN \nBecause it motivates me to do better! \n(Beat) \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 186 – Quiet \n \n15 \nALSO MARTIN \nDoes it though? Or… does it just keep paralysing us, make us shrink back and \nwait, hoping things work out? Like with John when we thought the worms had \ngot him. \nMARTIN \nHey, to be fair, he still kind of hated me back then. I’m really not sure it would \nhave been the time to take my shot. \nALSO MARTIN \nFair. He was projecting hard. Between us that guy’s got some real issues. \nMARTIN \nHey! Pretty sure we love ‘that guy’. \nALSO MARTIN \nYeah, and all his many, many problems. \nMARTIN \nFine. \nALSO MARTIN \nBut also, you know that’s not what I’m talking about. It’s this, this fantasy that \nyou have, that, that whatever you find at the top of the Panopticon is just \ngoing to solve everything. \nMARTIN \nI don’t— \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 186 – Quiet \n \n16 \nALSO MARTIN \nYou do though. You daydream about it! The big climactic showdown with Elias, \nand then the two of kiss, and push a button that just magically saves the world \nand makes everything better. \nMARTIN \nIt’s actually not a button, so— \nALSO MARTIN \nStop. Deflecting. \nMARTIN \n(Angry) S-So what, okay? We should just give up? Hmm? Just stay here and \ncurl up into a ball and just accept the world as is? Hmm? That’s your big \nsolution? \nALSO MARTIN \nI’m saying there aren’t any easy solutions. We have no idea what’s going to \nhappen. Even if we make it to the tower, we don’t know there’ll be a fix. And if \nby some miracle there is, we both know the price will be awful. Just look at \nMelanie. \nMARTIN \nI— \n(A resigned sigh) \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 186 – Quiet \n \n17 \nALSO MARTIN \nWe are completely out of our depth. We’re responsible for everyone \neverywhere, and we have no idea what we’re doing. The last thing we need is \nself-indulgent guilt on top of that. \nMARTIN \nI can be a real manipulative prick, you know that? \nALSO MARTIN \nOh yeah. \n(Beat) \n(Martin sighs) \n[Martin finishes his cuppa] \nMARTIN \n(Grimly) Tea. Please? \n[Flask is unscrewed and tea poured] \n[Martin takes a sip] \nMARTIN (CONT’D) \nSo, this price. What do you think? \nAre we going to have to kill John? \nALSO MARTIN \nI don’t know because you don’t know. But it seems like something we should \nat least consider. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 186 – Quiet \n \n18 \nMARTIN \nI… have thought about it. And... I won’t. I don’t think I could. \nALSO MARTIN \nMm-hmm. \nMARTIN \nBut anything else? Any other price? I’ll pay it. \nALSO MARTIN \nEven dying? \nMARTIN \nYeah! \nALSO MARTIN \nJohn’s as bad as we are. He wouldn’t let it happen. \nMARTIN \nIt’s not his decision. \nALSO MARTIN \nFine. So flip that round, then. What are you going to do when he tries to \nsacrifice himself, because you know he’s going to try? \nMARTIN \nI don’t know all right?
