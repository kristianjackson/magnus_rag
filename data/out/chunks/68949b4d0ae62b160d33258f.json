H-Hold on. Hold on, hold on. \n[The Archivist’s quick footsteps continue] \nOi, John! \nARCHIVIST \n(Softly) Oh, right. \n[Martin stops; the Archivist returns to him] \nMARTIN \nJust wait a sec— Christ, I just need a moment to… catch my breath. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 192 – An Appointment \n \n8 \nARCHIVIST \nOf course. Sorry, I uh... \nMARTIN \nIt’s fine, I just… this is a lot of steps. \nARCHIVIST \n(Chuckles) It’s a very tall tower. \nMARTIN \nIs it? Oh, thank god I have you ‘All-Seeing One’, otherwise I might have \ncompletely missed that fact. \nARCHIVIST \nYes, alright. \n[Martin gathers his breath, as the Archivist shifts around] \nMARTIN \nNot keeping you am I? \nARCHIVIST \nS— No, I— it’s just, I, uh... \nMARTIN \nWhat, you’re not tired? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 192 – An Appointment \n \n9 \nARCHIVIST \n(Slight chuckle) Oh no, believe me, I am. It’s just, uh... It’s kind of difficult not \nto keep climbing. \nMARTIN \nWhat, like… you’re being called? \nARCHIVIST \nMore like pulled. Gently, but very definitely upwards, towards the top. \nMARTIN \nThat could be a bad sign. \nARCHIVIST \nProbably. Too late to bail now, though. \nMARTIN \nTrue. \nYou seem less nervous at least? \nARCHIVIST \n(Breezily) Oh god, no. I-I’m far more scared than I was down there, but, I-I \ndon’t know, I feel... giddy. Powerful. Coming up from the tunnels into the \ntower, I-I can See again and... It’s just a bit of a rush, you know? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 192 – An Appointment \n \n10 \nMARTIN \nSure. Just... just try to keep it together, okay? The last thing we need is you… \nwigging out. \nARCHIVIST \nI will do my best. \nYou ready? \nMARTIN \n(Wearily) Ah, sure. Lead on, Macduff. \nARCHIVIST \nIt’s, uh, “Lay on— \nMARTIN \n(Frustrated) Sh— I know, I know! I know. Just go. Just go. \nARCHIVIST \nyes… okay. \n[The Archivist heads off at a quick pace; Martin following a slower \npace] \n(Martin makes a frustrated sigh) \n[Tape clicks off] \n[Tape clicks on] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 192 – An Appointment \n \n11 \n[A large wooden door creaks open; Martin and the Archivist’s \nfootsteps echo in a large space as they enter; the faint pulsing tone \ncontinues] \nMARTIN \nSo. \nThis is it. The big boss. One last set of unnecessarily ominous doors and then— \nROSIE \nGood morning! Do you have an appointment? \n[Faint hissing static starts] \n[Backpack zipper jangles as Martin is startled] \n(Startled noise from Martin) \nMARTIN \n(Shocked) R-Rosie? What, what are you doing here? \n[Rose walks closer, she is in heels] \nROSIE \n(Unrecognising and slightly stilted) Hello, I’m Rosie. Assistant for Mr Magnus. \nDo you have an appointment? \nMARTIN \n(Quietly) W— \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 192 – An Appointment \n \n12 \nARCHIVIST \nNo. \nMARTIN \n(Quietly) Wh— what? \nARCHIVIST \nWe don’t. \nROSIE \nOh, I see. Uh... well I’m-I’m very sorry, but I’m afraid he’s booked up for quite \nsome time. \nYou may need to try again another day. \nMARTIN \nRosie, are you alright? It’s, it’s us. It’s, it’s okay, we’re here to help. \n[A couple of steps as Rosie backs away] \nROSIE \nSir, please calm down. \nMARTIN \nI’m not— \nROSIE \nThere’s no need to get worked up, I’m only doing my job. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 192 – An Appointment \n \n13 \nMARTIN \nRosie, I’m not going to do— \n[Hissing static gets louder] \nARCHIVIST \nJonah Magnus will see us. Please inform him we’re here. \nROSIE \nI really don’t think that that’s a— \nARCHIVIST \nI insist. \n(Rosie sighs) \nROSIE \n(Softly) Your funeral... \n[Hissing static fades a little as she takes a couple of steps] \n[She clicks an intercom switch, and a swirling static starts] \nROSIE \nExcuse me, sir. Two gentlemen here to see you. \nARCHIVIST \nThe Archivist. And Martin Blackwood. \nROSIE \nThe Archivist. And, uh... an ‘associate’.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 1, "chunk_count": 9, "chars": 4159}}
