A terrible, whistling sound like the \nhowling of a gale. And then… \nI don’t know when I noticed the green light on the control panel, the one next \nto the button the driver had held when we first started the journey. It certainly \nhadn’t been lit the last time we were moving, maybe not since the first time \nwe stopped. I couldn’t afford to let hope come into my heart, I knew that \nwould be too cruel, but I also knew I couldn’t ignore it. \nI finally, painfully stood up. My whole body was shaking so violently I thought I \nwould collapse before I’d even taken my first step, but little by little I inched \nmy way towards it, never taking my eyes off the green light. Never looking \ntowards the door. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 124 – Left Hanging \n9 \n \nWhen my fingers finally found the button, I slammed it with all the strength I \nhad left in me, and I felt the car begin to move upwards again. I had no idea if \nwhatever was on top of the car was still there, but when I saw the third tower \nrising up out of the clouds, I could feel myself weeping with relief. I didn’t even \nfeel the juddering as we hit it. \nI don’t remember much after that. I don't think I was making much sense. I \nknow it took them a long time to get us back down from the top of Untersberg \nwithout using the cable car. I remember talking to the police, even if I don’t \nremember whether I told them the truth. I think the official story became that \nthe driver, a man named Otto Hessler, had killed himself halfway up the \nmountain by leaping to his death. The body was never found, and the report \nmade no mention of an old man. \nI still get nightmares, of course, and my fear of heights has worsened \nconsiderably. I’ve tried talking to professionals about it, but for the most part \nthey treat it as though I’m talking in metaphors. And I generally let them \nbelieve that. The worst part is the strain the whole affair has put on my \nrelationship with my mother. She refuses to admit any of it happened, \nrepeating the same version of events given by the Salzburg police. She looks \nme right in the eyes and tells me she doesn’t know what I’m talking about, that \nthere was no old man, no clouds, nothing climbing the cables behind me. \nWe both know she’s lying. I don’t know if there’ll be any more holidays. \nCertainly, none that involve mountains. \nARCHIVIST \nStatement ends. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 124 – Left Hanging \n10 \n \nSimon Fairchild is one of the recurrent figures that I think disquiets me the \nmost. Not simply for what he does, the endless spaces of height or depth to \nwhich he is so quick to condemn his victims, but the joy he seems to take in \ndoing so. And I don’t think there is much to this tale beyond that: an evil man \ntormenting and killing simply for his own pleasure, and to feed the power that \nsustains him. In other cases I might think the location noteworthy, might try to \npiece together some wider plan, but Fairchild seems to travel far and wide for \nhis victims, with no motivation other than variety. I do not think I ever wish to \nmeet him. \nOf course, even if I did want to do research into this statement, I wouldn’t have \nany help doing so. It’s been a week and Melanie’s attitude towards me hasn’t \nsoftened, and Basira, though she is very willing to talk, still doesn’t seem to \ntrust me enough to let me in on whatever plans she might have. If she has any \nplans at all, of course. I could make her tell me, I know that, but I can’t afford \nto burn any more bridges. Still no sign of Peter Lukas, of course. Or of Mart— \nWait. \nWait. \n[Archivist opens door. The Archivist and Martin’s subsequent conversation \ntakes place in the corridor and is somewhat distant to the recorder.] \nARCHIVIST \nMartin! Martin! \nMARTIN \n(Dry and noncommittal throughout this exchange) Oh... Hi, John. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 124 – Left Hanging \n11 \n \nARCHIVIST \nMartin, i-i-it's, uh— I-I haven't seen you. \nMARTIN \nYeah. Sorry. \nARCHIVIST \nWhere, where have you been? I-I mean, I thought... \nMARTIN \nNo, No I’ve been here. I just, uh, you know, been busy. \nARCHIVIST \nBusy? \nMARTIN \nYeah. \nARCHIVIST \nRight. Working for Lukas? \nMARTIN \nNo, P-Peter's— I— It's complicated. \nARCHIVIST \n… Right.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 4, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 4210}}
