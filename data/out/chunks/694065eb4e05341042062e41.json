My lamp barely illuminated the single figure \nthat stood on it. (Sigh) It was Danny. At least, I, I think it was. It looked like him; \nthe same hair, the same clothes, but there was something not right about how \nhe looked. Like he was smaller, somehow, slightly folded in on himself. It didn’t \nmatter; I shouted down to him, to let him know I was there. He didn’t look up, \nbut when my voice echoed around the stone theatre, I knew I’d made a \nhorrible mistake. \nFrom somewhere above me, a spotlight suddenly turned on, shining down \nonto the stage, painfully bright against the white stone. The air became \nuncomfortably hot, and there was some \n\nsort of music. The spotlight wasn’t on Danny. Instead, it picked out a figure \ncrouched in the corner. All ruffles, and polka dots, and tights. A clown. It \ncrouched and contorted in the corner, hands backwards over its face, but not \nso much that I couldn’t see the dark red patterns that seemed to flow down its \neyes. I couldn’t move. \nSlowly, so slowly, its right arm reached out towards Danny. It placed its hand \non the floor with a long, low groan, then pulled itself along the floor, the fabric \nof its colourful dress scraping the rough stone of the stage, and its cheek \nrubbing against the ground, leaving a trail of red behind it. Then it was still for \na second, before a leg reached out in front, and it began to drag the rest of the \nclown behind it. \nI always tell myself there was some force there. Something that held me in \nplace and meant that all I could do was watch. But sometimes when I think \nback, I remember how my legs shook, and maybe I could move. Maybe I’m just \na coward. \nThe clown reached my brother, who still hadn’t moved an inch, and unfurled to \nits full height. \nThe red on the cheeks was now clearly blood, and something black oozed \ndown from its shock of hair. It took Danny by the hand and looked up, right at \nme, smiling like nothing has ever smiled since. “Shall I?” he asked, with a voice \nso full of playful mischief that I felt bile rise in my throat. I wanted to shake my \nhead, say no, but I never got a chance. \nWith a single, smooth motion, like whipping the tablecloth off in a restaurant, \nhe pulled the skin off of whatever had been pretending it was my brother. I \ndon’t know how to describe it. It was like an impressionist painting of a dancer, \n\nall colours and shapes that made you feel movement you couldn’t see. Silently, \nimperceptibly, moving from one position to another. The music had stopped \nand the dance was silent. It was beautiful. \nThe next thing I remember was the cool night air on my face, as the opera \nhouse patrons pushed past me to get into the evening performance of Tosca. \nIn my hands I held an old black and white circus flyer. It was written all over in \nCyrillic, but in the bottom left corner was a certain clown’s face, leering out at \nme, billed as the guest performer. As I watched, it crumbled to ash, and floated \naway on the breeze. \nMARTIN \nThat was the last time you ever saw your brother? \nTIM \nYeah. \nMARTIN \nYou never went back? \nTIM \nTo the auditorium? No. If I had, I... I don’t think they’d let me leave a second \ntime. \nMARTIN \nThat’s why you joined the Institute, isn’t it? \nTIM \n\nI thought I might be able to find something about what happened, but... I \nguess at some point I stopped seriously looking, and started to just… get \ncomfortable. \nMARTIN \nUntil John… \nTIM \nUntil the Archives, yeah. \nMARTIN \nTim, the, the clown that you described is— \nTIM \nYeah, I know. It didn’t take too much looking around to match the description \nof Victorian London’s most famous clown- \n(Martin sighs) \nTIM \n-Joseph Grimaldi. A Covent Garden theatre regular. \nMARTIN \nI mean, 200 years is a long time, but... \nTIM \nYeah, it’s him though. Or it looks like him. Or his ghost or something. I don’t \nknow why, but… \n\nI think he’s with the Russian circus. \nMARTIN \nYeah. \nTIM \nYou’re reckon they’re trying to what, end the world? \nMARTIN \nI mean maybe it’s not... yeah, I think so. \nTIM \nAnd no one told me. \nMARTIN \nYou were never here to tell, Tim. \nTIM \nWell, I am now! I don’t care about the rest of it, if anyone’s going to find that \nCircus, I’m coming too. You’re not going to stop me! \nMARTIN \nI mean, sure, sure, I think that’s actually a good i— \n[The door opens] \nELIAS \nKnock, knock.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 4, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 4384}}
