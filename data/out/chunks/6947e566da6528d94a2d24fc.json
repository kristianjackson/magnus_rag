I lay in bed all \nmorning and then into the afternoon. \nFinally, at about three o’clock, I heard the soft knock at the door. It was the \nexact same knock at the exact same time, and I felt my body seize up with fear. \nThere was the sound of the door opening, but nothing else. I just lay there, \nstraining my ears to hear any sound. The air grew close and heavy, like a \nthunderstorm about to break, but still I heard nothing. Ten minutes passed. \nThen an hour. And then the air was split by the most unnatural scream I have \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG078 – Distant Cousin \n9 \n \never heard. I cannot even begin to describe it, except to say that there was \nnothing in it but the purest rage. \nPanic surged through me. I had to get out of that house. I threw open the \nbedroom door and charged down the stairs towards the front. And as I did so, I \npassed by the living room, and I instinctively turned my head to see inside. \nAdelard Dekker stood in the corner. He was straight and motionless, his lips \nmoving rapidly, though no sound came out of them. In the centre of the room, \nnext to the empty box, stood a table carved from dark wood and wrapped all \nover with a sprawling, intricate pattern. And in front of that table was the thing \nthat had said it was my cousin. It was long and thin, the tops of it bent against \nthe ceiling and its stick-like limbs flailed from too many joints and elbows. \nWrapped around it were thick strands of what I think was spider’s web, \nstretching back into the table, which I now saw pulsed along its carved \nchannels with a sickly light. The face at the top of that gangly frame was like \nnothing on earth. \nThat was all I saw, because the second after I had taken it in, I was out of the \ndoor and down the street, running as fast as I could away from that house. I \nkept running until I collapsed, and lay there on the street until a passer-by \nasked if I needed help. \nI didn’t return to my house until the next morning. Dekker’s blue van was \ngone, and in its place was another one, dirty white. There was something \nprinted on the side, but I couldn’t make it out under the grime. I watched two \nmen in overalls carry that same box out of my house, load it up, and drive \naway. That was about two months ago, and it was the last time I saw them, the \ntable, Adelard Dekker, or the thing that wasn’t my cousin. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG078 – Distant Cousin \n10 \n \nMy aunt and uncle have reported Carl missing. The police did come round and \nasked me if I knew anything but I told them nothing. I just said we weren’t very \nclose. \nARCHIVIST \nStatement ends. \nI found this in the folder marked 9910602, where Gertrude’s tape had \nindicated I would find the statement of Dekker himself. There is nothing else in \nthere, but I think it tells me what I need to know. This thing, this “Not Sasha”, \nit’s tied to the table. It… \nI found the tapes. \n[The sound of a cassette tape being turned on and playing] \nSASHA (RECORDING) \nI thought it was pronounced “Kah-lee-o-pee? \nARCHIVIST \nThey were in her desk. Well hidden, but… If I’d been a bit more thorough, if I… \n[The sounds of the cassette tape] \nSASHA (RECORDING) \nIt’s just a scratch, John. I’ll be fine.
