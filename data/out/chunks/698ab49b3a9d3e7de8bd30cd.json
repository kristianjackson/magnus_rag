I mean, when you think about what they really \nare. People don’t give the actuality of language the weight it deserves, I feel. \nWords are a way of taking your thoughts, the very make-up of yourself, and \ngiving them to another. Putting your thoughts in the mind of someone else. \nThey are not a perfect method, of course, as there’s plenty of scope for \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG017 – The Boneturner’s Tale \n2 \n \nmutation and corruption between your mind and that of the listener, but that \ndoesn’t change the essence of what language is. Spoken aloud though, the \nthought dies quickly if not picked up. Simple vibrations that vanish almost as \nsoon as they are created, though if they find a host then they can lodge there, \nproliferate and maybe spread further. Still, it is not a reliable method in terms \nof a thought’s endurance, as humans are fragile creatures and rarely last a \ncentury. \nA book, though, is another story. There are written texts that have outlived the \ncivilisations that created them. Imagine, thoughts hundreds, thousands of \nyears old, preserved and ready to be taken again. Corrupted, or translated, \nperhaps, by a culture that does not understand them, but still, ideas that have \noutlived by lifetimes the mind that first conceived them. Will the thoughts that \nfirst ran through Shakespeare’s head ever stop being thought by someone, \nsomewhere? And a book, so dense with a mind’s fossilised creations, is it any \nwonder they have been ascribed such power throughout the ages? Or that an \nold library, with heavy tomes covering every wall, seems to have such a weight \nto it, beyond the physical presence of the texts it holds? \nI used to work at Chiswick Library. I didn’t have such ideas back then, though. I \njust knew I loved books, always had, and so when the opportunity arose to \nwork in my local library I jumped at the chance. I had been a voracious reader \never since I was old enough to hold a book for myself, and even before that my \nmother tells me I would pester her constantly to read to me. I suppose you \nmight say my mind has always been receptive to the thoughts that lurk in the \nwritten page. Still, Chiswick Library is a long way from the cramped and austere \nlibraries you’re probably imagining. It’s light and airy, with bookshelves and \ncarpets that speak more of cash-strapped local councils than of the rich", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 0, "chunk_count": 9, "chars": 3172}}
