It’s not— \nIt’s just a word. A word used by… fools like Smirke to try and sort everything \ninto neat little boxes, to reduce the messy spray of human fear into a checklist: \nHuman, avatar, monster, victim. Only now, now there’s a binary. There’s finally \na clear dividing line and, well, I’m sorry you’re not happy with which side \nyou’ve ended up on. \n(Beat) \nMARTIN \nWhat about Daisy? Or Basira? \nARCHIVIST \nDaisy carved through the domains of others. Basira, well... in a very real way \nshe was a sufferer in Daisy’s domain. Maybe the only one. Hunting, following, \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 183 – Monument \n20 \nhurting. Now Daisy’s dead... she’s free. Sort of. She’s inherited something of \nDaisy’s ability to move through the other domains. \nFor now, she’ll feed off what she sees in them. As to whether the Eye \nultimately gives her a domain of her own... I don’t know yet. \nMARTIN \nYou didn’t tell her any of that. \nARCHIVIST \nI didn’t think the metaphysics of her place in the fear ecosystem was \nsomething she’d be particularly interested in at that moment. \nMARTIN \nFair. But you seem very reluctant to tell anyone any of this stuff. \nARCHIVIST \nI did try, right at the start, but you didn’t seem to want to talk about it, so I \ndidn’t push it. It’s hard, I have so much knowledge but... how do I decide what \npeople want me to share, and what they never want to know? \nMARTIN \nI guess that makes sense. \n(Beat) \nSo what did you mean about the crossroads? When you were talking to Helen? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 183 – Monument \n21 \nARCHIVIST \nIt’s a maze in there. Something between a, a Rubik’s Cube and a Magic Eye \npicture. I can find us the way through easily enough but, well, for us, there are \ntwo ways out. Two paths to London. \nMARTIN \nWhat are the choices? \nARCHIVIST \nOne would be a long, winding route — we’d see a lot of horrors, but remain \npersonally untouched. \nMARTIN \nAnd the other is my domain? \nARCHIVIST \nEventually. It’s a shorter path. With faces we know along the way. Including \nHelen. \nMARTIN \nI thought Helen was her domain, with all the doors and that? \nARCHIVIST \nShe is, but she has a position within this pseudo-landscape like any other. \nMARTIN \nO-Okay. So, so, I mean, I suppose we’ve got to do that one, right? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 183 – Monument \n22 \nARCHIVIST \nWe don’t have to. W-We could just— \nMARTIN \nWhat? What? We could, we could dodge around it? Take the path of denial? I \nguess. But… what is it you keep harping on about? ‘The journey will be the \njourney’? \nI mean… It’s pretty obvious that this one is my journey. \nARCHIVIST \nIf you’re sure. \n(Beat) \nMARTIN \nI’m sure I love you. \nARCHIVIST \nI love you too. \n[Fabric rustles of an embrace] \nLet’s go. \n[Tape clicks off] \n[The Magnus Archives Theme – Outro] \nJONATHAN SIMS \nThe Magnus Archives is a podcast distributed by Rusty Quill and licensed under \na Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial ShareAlike 4.0 International", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 5, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 3077}}
