I’m not, I’m not one of them. \n \nTIM \nEveryone is, this isn’t... Just get back! \n \nBASIRA \nOkay. Okay. Who, who are you? \n \nTIM \nI don’t know, do I! \n \nBASIRA \nW-what can we do? \n \nTIM \nIt’s too late. There’s nothing. \n \nBASIRA \nThere must be. We just need to figure this out. I, I know I’m me. \n \nTIM \nSo what’s your name? Huh? Who exactly is ‘Me’? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG119 – Stranger and Stranger \n \n10 \n \n \nBASIRA \nIt doesn’t matter... Names don’t matter. I just… I know, I know I’m me, and I \nknow I’m here. \n \nTIM \nBullshit. ‘Here’ is... \n \n(Tim makes a frustrated noise) \n \nBASIRA \n(Trying desperately to reason) There are things that are not me. They want \nto... to hurt me. But I... I don’t want to hurt you. \n \nTIM \nI don’t believe you. \n \nBASIRA \nI don’t want to hurt anyone... \n \nTIM \nGet back! \n \nBASIRA \nNo, we can do this. I, I can do this.

I don’t, I don’t understand. \n \n(The music swells) \n \n(Musical swell fades) \n \nARCHIVIST \nIt isn’t... It isn’t real. \n \nNIKOLA \nWhat isn’t real, John? \n \nARCHIVIST \nI don’t... None of it. None of this is real. \n \nNIKOLA \nOh, but it is! Just because you don’t understand, doesn’t mean it’s a lie. \n \nARCHIVIST \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG119 – Stranger and Stranger \n \n12 \n \nWho are you? \n \nNIKOLA \nWhy, I’m... Tim, of course! Who else would I be? \n \nARCHIVIST \nYou’re not... you’re not Tim. \n \nNIKOLA \nOh! You caught me! I’m Sasha. \n \nARCHIVIST \nShut up! \n \nNIKOLA \nNo, really, it’s me, Sasha whatever-her-name-was, back from the dead, just like \nyou wanted! \n \nARCHIVIST \nGet away from me! Or, or I swear, I’ll, I’ll— \n \nNIKOLA \nYou’ll what? Hit me? (Laughing) Go on then, try it. Make a fist. \n \nARCHIVIST \nI, I— \n \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG119 – Stranger and Stranger \n \n13 \n \nNIKOLA \nDo you even know which of these hands is yours? \n \nARCHIVIST \nStop. Stop it! Stand still! \n \nNIKOLA \nDo you even know what a hand is? \n \n(Archivist tries to steady his breathing) \n \nGERTRUDE (NIKOLA) \nPathetic. \n \nARCHIVIST \nWait, I-I-I know you. \n \nGERTRUDE (NIKOLA) \nI would hope you do. \n \nARCHIVIST \nHow are you here? \n \nGERTRUDE (NIKOLA) \nDon’t be obtuse, John. I’m here because you failed. \n \nARCHIVIST \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG119 – Stranger and Stranger \n \n14 \n \nI, I, I tried. I almost— \n \nGERTRUDE (NIKOLA) \nYou almost what? You almost didn’t doom the world? (Laughs as Nikola) No. \nYou almost left reality to be the plaything of a lazy, foolish voyeur. \n \nARCHIVIST \nNo, no, no. I wouldn’t— I could have stopped it. \n \nGERTRUDE (NIKOLA) \nHow? You didn’t even know what it was. Do you know how many people I \nkilled to keep the world in one piece? The sacrifices I made? And you didn’t \neven know what you were fighting. \n \nARCHIVIST \nN-no, I-I d-didn’t— \n \nGERTRUDE (NIKOLA) \nI suppose it’s of no consequence now. It’s far too late. \n \nARCHIVIST \nWhat can I do? \n \nGERTRUDE (NIKOLA) \nYou could scream, I suppose. Weep, maybe.

(Pause) You know, it’s probably for the best I’m dead. Can you imagine \nhow much I’d hate having to watch you fumble around as my replacement. I \nreally cannot express how much of a disappointment you are. \n \nARCHIVIST \nI, I’m sorry. I, I didn’t even— \n \nGERTRUDE (NIKOLA) \nI fought for years to stop the Stranger in its tracks, and you didn’t even notice \nwhen they desecrated my corpse. And now look at me. You’ve made me part \nof their ritual. This is your fault. \n \nARCHIVIST \nIt is not. I didn’t know... It’s not my fault you died. \n \nLEITNER (NIKOLA) \nNo, I suppose not. Me, on the other hand... That one is very much your fault. \n \nARCHIVIST \nNo, not... Not you as well. \n \nLEITNER (NIKOLA) \nOh yes.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 1, "chunk_count": 5, "chars": 4352}}
