Gertrude Robinson \nrecording. \nGERTRUDE (STATEMENT) \nI read somewhere once I was the first man to use the term “Dust Bowl”. Now, \nthat’s not so. Maybe the first the boys in the New York office had heard, but \ndown in Oklahoma it wasn’t too unusual a turn of phrase. Wide, flat, open \n\nspaces… You could see a storm coming for miles, coming straight at you all \nacross the horizon, looking near as anything like the end of the world. \nThose were bad days. Worse than anyone knows. Did my best to spread the \nword, filed my copy with the AP, but there was plenty I never did find the \nwords for. There were things in the dust that I never told to a soul. It’s why I \ndecided to step in on you folks. I still wish there was a place like this back \nhome, but the way things are going they’d be up in front of Congress, likely as \nnot, so maybe it’s for the best. \nYou know much about dust pneumonia? Don’t know why you would do, really. \nThere isn’t much of it about these days. Wasn’t back then, either, at least \nbefore the storms came. Then there was plenty. The name makes it sound \nmore complicated than it is. You see, ‘dust pneumonia’ is just a medical way of \nsaying your lungs are full of mud. Too much goes in, you see, and it clogs up all \nthe bits of your chest that should clear them out. There’s fever, difficulty \nbreathing, infection... The dust mixes with the moisture of your insides, and \nsoon enough you’re drowning, your lungs packed solid with mud and mucus. \nAwful thing to happen to anybody, but that’s what the dust storms were. Great \nchunks of earth torn up and hurled across the open plains, desperate to find \nsome poor unsheltered throat and climb inside. They buried you alive, without \neven giving you the courtesy of getting you below the ground. And I saw so \nmany choking farmers, their dirt-streaked faces seemed to blend together. \nWatching as their livelihoods evaporated with the rain. As their farms, their \nhomes, their lives collapsed into dirt. It was all a long sepia blur: weather-\nbeaten faces caked in that same patina of misery and grit. All except for Stefan. \n\nStefan Brotchen was, to all appearances, much the same as any other Okie \nfarmer: strongly built, with a mess of short, curly, blond hair and a round, \nsmiling face. But his eyes were different. \nThere was… something there. I-I was never quite sure what, but they had a \ndepth, a quiet intensity to them that struck me the first time I saw him. I'd \nbeen gathering comment for an AP article on the latest dust storms to hit the \narea. There’d been a lot of interest nationally after one dust storm made it all \nthe way to Washington, and my editor was keen to get some comment from \nthe people worst hit. So, naturally, I ended up in Boise City. \nThere was always something odd about that town. Something about it at odds \nwith the land it sat on. Challenged the wide stretches of nothing. I guess that’s \nnot a surprise, looking back. I did some research on the place afterwards, you \nsee. Did you know that Boise City was founded by fraud? I mean literal, send-\nyou-to-prison fraud. Yeah, back in 1908, three men decided to start selling the \ndeeds to land they didn’t own. They printed up hundreds of brochures: “Come \nto scenic Boise City! Tree-lined boulevards, all the amenities, even a railroad \nstation, all ready and waiting for brave souls to head out there and settle.” And \npeople bought it. Almost three thousand of them. Of course, when they finally \narrived to this fabled town, there was absolutely nothing there at all. Just \nempty, waiting earth. They didn’t even own the plots of land they’d been sold. \nBut they stayed, and they built a town. Not a great town, by any stretch. Not \neven a good town, truth be told, but there it was, in defiance of all good sense. \nOne of the men who settled in the newly formed Boise City was Stefan \nBrotchen’s father. He was long-dead by the time we met his son. My \nphotographer, a small man named Harry Eisenhard, had been told abou", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 0, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 4500}}
