They tend to get left behind, \nand I suppose it doesn’t help that I can’t bring myself to see any of them as \nanything other than trivial. \nMARTIN \nMm. \nSIMON \nNo wonder I’m so sympathetic to the Lonely! You know, this really is a place for \nself-discovery, isn’t it? (Chuckles) Statement ends I suppose. \nMARTIN \nEr, I’m sorry? \nSIMON \nOh nothing, just my own hubris. I should have known. When I came here, I said to \nmyself, “Simon,” I said, “you’re going to answer this young man’s questions, but \nyou’re not going to give the Watcher a statement. You’re better than that.” But \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 151 – Big Picture \n17 \n \nit’s a hard one to resist, isn’t it? You get in the flow of talking about yourself and it \nall just... tumbles out. \nMARTIN \nDoes seem like it. \nSIMON \n(Laughs) Well, this has been fun. Now, if we’re about done-- \nMARTIN \nWe’re not. Sit back down. \nSIMON \nBold! (chuckles) I like it. \nMARTIN \nYou said you were here to answer my questions for Peter, but so far you’ve told \nme basically nothing of any use. \nSIMON \nThe big answers are rarely helpful. \nMARTIN \nThen let’s try some smaller ones. Is Peter attempting a ritual? \nSIMON \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 151 – Big Picture \n18 \n \nNot in the sense that you’re used to. Him and his family made their play a few \nyears ago and they failed. I’m sure he’d like me to explain it but I think he can do \nthat one himself. \nMARTIN \nHow honest has he been with me? \nSIMON \nAbout which part? \nMARTIN \nProtecting the others. \nSIMON \nI think he tried. I suspect he may have slightly exaggerated his abilities when you \nfirst made the deal, but he certainly expended a reasonable amount of influence \nand resources to follow through. \nMARTIN \nBut that was never the endgame was it? He just wanted me on side long enough \nto rope me into his - his plans for the Extinction. \nSIMON \nDo you really need me to answer that one? \nMARTIN \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 151 – Big Picture \n19 \n \nFine. So why me? What’s his plan? Why not get the others involved? \nSIMON \nHe is what he is, Martin. For a creature of the Lonely, the urge is always to isolate, \nnever to communicate or connect. I suspect that’s why he’s so keen on wagers, it \nallows him a framework for cooperation that doesn’t risk any sort of intimacy. \nAs for his plan... I don’t know the details. But I believe there’s something in the \nInstitute that he thinks can help his cause. \nMARTIN \nAnd he needs me to use it? \nSIMON \nPresumably, from what he said it must be powerfully aligned to the Watcher. If he \nwishes to use it, it would need someone already touched by the Eye. And if he \nwants to control that someone... \nMARTIN \nThey need to serve the Lonely. \nSIMON \nQuite right. Anything else? \nMARTIN \nHow do you feel about this? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 151 – Big Picture \n20 \n \nSIMON \nYou might need to be a tad more specific. \nMARTIN \nAll of it. Peter’s plan, the extinction, me. \nSIMON \nI think… (inhale) I think Peter is taking a rather large but calculated gamble. Not \njust on you, but on a lot of things. If it works, he’ll be in a very strong position. \nAnd if he fails it won’t be all that bad. \nMARTIN \nYou don’t think it’ll be the end of the world? \nSIMON \nOh, it very well might be, but life has continued through dozens of apocalypse is \nalready. Ice ages, pandemics, calamities, extinctions. The only reason this one \nfeels special is because, well, it’s happening to you. And that’s the sort of \nsolipsism that tends to come with loneliness, in my experience. So my feeling is \nthat I’ll help out where I can, but ultimately if this Armageddon comes off, then so \nbe it. Either billions suffer and life goes on, or billions suffer and life doesn’t. In \nthe grand scheme of things it’s all much of a muchness. \nMARTIN \nRight. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 151 – Big Picture \n21 \n \nSIMON \nSorry. Too big picture? I get that a lot. \nMARTIN \nNo, it’s… thank you. This has actually been quite helpful. \nSIMON \nI’d say any time, but honestly, if you see me again I may just throw you off \nsomething for a joke. How do you feel about roller coasters? \nMARTIN \nUm… neutral. \nSIMON \n(Disappointed) Oh. You’re no fun. \n[Footsteps walk away] \nBASIRA \nWho was that? \nMARTIN \nBasira, please, I don’t have time. \nBASIRA \n(Interrupting) I know you don’t.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 4, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 4390}}
