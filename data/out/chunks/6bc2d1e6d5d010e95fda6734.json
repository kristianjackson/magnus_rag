It didn’t help that, over the course of a ten-year \nrelationship, “my friends” had become “our friends” and there weren’t any of \nthem siding with me in this situation. Some would drop platitudes about \nmaybe reconnecting after the fallout was done with, but I know when I’m \nbeing handled by people who “don’t want to create any more drama”. It was \nmiserable, but every time I thought about going back, I felt nauseous. The idea \nof returning to those eggshell walls that we never got around to repainting, \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 150 – Cul-de-Sac \n \n4 \n \nand the living room that expected me to sit there and watch Midsomer \nMurders until I passed away peacefully in my sleep … It made me want to \nthrow up. \nI’d probably have stayed away forever if it hadn’t been for the moose. There \nwas a carved wooden moose, you see, something Alberto’s grandfather had \ncarved, apparently, and a real family heirloom. It was an ugly old thing, with \nthis weird angular face that always made my skin crawl a bit. I’d never let him \ndisplay it in our house, so it had lived in one of the suitcases under the stairs, \nthe suitcases I pulled out and filled in a tearful rage when I was leaving. So \nyeah, I’d kind of accidentally stolen the moose. When he finally realised and \ntexted me, demanding it back, I should probably just have sent it by post, but \nno, for some reason I decided I was going to drive all the way down there and \ngive it back in person. Maybe I was hoping for a fight, or just to see him again. I \ndon’t know. I was younger, then. Foolish. \nIt was late when I got to what I thought was his street, driving through the one-\nway signs and well-maintained gardens that bordered that snaking road. The \nsun had disappeared, but the sky was still fairly light, that late-summer twilight \nthat seems to just drag on forever. There weren’t any other cars on the road, \nand I was already getting frustrated. My satnav had decided to start sending \nme around in a circle and I was apparently no closer to finding our— Alberto’s \nhouse. The roads weren’t like I remembered them. Or rather, they were \nexactly like I remembered them: bland, interchangeable and impossible to \nnavigate. \nI must have driven around for almost half an hour before I finally decided that, \nif the internet and GPS couldn’t help me, I’d have a proper look at the actual \npaper map that I kept in the boot. I spent a few minutes scanning the Cheadle \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 150 – Cul-de-Sac \n \n5 \n \narea until I found the road I was looking for: Ash Tree Hill. Then I drove on until \nI found a street sign at the next turning, hoping to compare it to what was on \nthe map. And then I stopped, because the sign said: “Road” – no name, just \n“Road”. And it wasn’t as though the actual name of the street had been \ndefaced or removed. The sign was complete; it just didn’t say anything else. So, \nI drove on until I found the next one. “Street.” I tried to compare it to the map \n– maybe this place just had some really bland road names and somehow I’d \nnever noticed in the two years I’d lived there – but no, the places on the map \nall had the names I remembered: Chapel Street, Meadow Drive, Station Road. \nBland, sure, generic … but not literally placeholder. I pressed on, looking for \nmore. “Avenue,” “Close,” “Way,” “Lane.” Only ever the suffix, never with a \nname attached. \nBy this point, I was starting to feel a little bit freaked out, and I decided to just \nget out of there. I could come back later, when my satnav was working \nproperly, in proper daylight. The sky was getting darker by this point, and I had \nto put my headlights on. I still hadn’t seen any other cars on the road or, as I \nthought more about it, people on the streets. But as you might imagine, \ngetting out of there proved even more difficult than finding the house I was \nlooking for. Every time I thought I’d found a main road that led out of this \nweird looping suburbia, a one-way sign seemed to spring up, directing me back \ninto the sprawl. I did U-turn after U-turn as I was channelled into one dead-end \ncul-de-sac after another, until eventually I decided to simply disregard the one-\nway signs completely. I cruised past the one that seemed to be blocking my \nmost likely exit, and almost breathed a sigh of relief, as I found myself leavi", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 2, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 4500}}
