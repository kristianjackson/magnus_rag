Do you see it creeping \nunder the door to your bedroom as you sleep, the burning coals of its eyes \nregarding you in the supposed safety of your home, not indifferent but hungry, \neager to take everything from you, to burn down your life in any sense it can \nreach. Can you hear the crackling promise of kindled despair that it whispers \ninto your uneasy, dreaming ear? \nSabina senses it, feels it drawing near. \nHow long has she lived here? How long have these cramped, dingy rooms in \nthe back of this sprawling rundown tenement been the place her heart calls \nhome? She cannot recall, but long enough for her to grow into love for it, to \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 169 – Fire Escape \n14 \ncherish every rusted appliance, every crumbling piece of plasterboard, every \nflickering lightbulb. \n[A sounds of the apartment continue, but there is now a distant, \nmuffled crackling that slowly increases in intensity] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nEven as the widening cracks and spreading mould fill her heart with dread, \nthey gently, slowly, inch by inch approach the mildewed room where her \nparents lie sleeping. Sabina cannot picture their faces, but knows that should \nthey wake to see the state of the place, their anger would be blistering. She \nsits there on the ratty, torn sofa, trying to bring herself to stand up, to do \nsomething about the place that is crumbling around her. But she is locked \nthere by the sure knowledge that anything she touches could result in the \ncomplete loss of what small stability she has. She barely notices how hot her \ntears are becoming. \nWhich sense is the first to warn her? What nerves are the first ones to fire the \nwhite-hot bolts of agonizing panic through Sabina's body? Does she smell it, \nthe rising smoke? A slow and subtle scent, like someone's burned their toast, \nand… is that hair? Does she hear it, the distant roaring, like the soft growl of a \nlion who never stops approaching, spotted with shrieks and screams that \nmight just be her imagination? Does she see it, the glow of the flames, pulsing \nslow and steady, the dull orange of old streetlights, but somehow strong \nenough to push through the cracks around the front door? Does she feel it, the \nrising prickly heat, like she has sat too close to an electric radiator for too long, \nand her skin has begun to redden and blossom before the bars into thick beads \nof sweat? Or does she taste it in the back of her throat, the sick, queasy terror \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 169 – Fire Escape \n15 \nthat tells her she knows exactly what is coming. Because it's all happened \nbefore. \nOnce again, the handle of the front door begins to glow red-hot, the metal \nbending and distorting as it melts. From the crack underneath, the fire drags \nitself forward, curling and caressing the rough coir of the mat that cheerily \nannounced ‘Welcome Home!’ Its movements are flickering, rhythmic, almost \nhypnotic, and as her mind screams at her to stand, to run, to escape, she \nsimply sits there, eyes locked on the dancing lights emerging around her front \ndoor. She smiles the same smile she did when she was a child, staring at the \nbonfire at camp, though every nerve in her body is alight with fear. \nThen the welcome mat ignites completely, in an instant turning from a gentle \nsmoulder to a gout of flame, and whatever strange compulsion holds her in \nplace snaps like a wire cable. \n[Muffled fire is joined with collapses and the sound of closer fire] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nShe leaps to her feet and starts screaming, calling for help for her parents. She \nruns to the door to their room but as she approaches she can feel the heat \nalready wafting out from behind it. She can hear them crying out in agony, \nbegging for her to save them as their pain crescendos. \nShe can smell the oily reek of charred skin as they call to her: ‘We're burning! \nWe're burning! Oh please, god, Sabina; we're burning!’ \nShe grabs the handle, ignoring the sizzling of her own flesh and pushing \nthrough the lancing needles of torment to force it down, trying to free her \nunseen parents.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 3, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 4126}}
