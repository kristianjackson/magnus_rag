There \nwere no people in there, but that’s not the same thing as it being empty. \nInstead there were ... figures. From a distance, they looked like human beings \nstanding impossibly still, but getting closer quickly revealed the lie. They were \njust the rough shapes, cobbled together out of a hundred different pieces of \ngarbage: a broken metal clothes horse for a ribcage, a plastic chair leg for an \narm, rusted screws for teeth. In some cases, it looked like someone had gone \nto a lot of effort to match anatomy with construction. I saw one with a broken \nwater cooler where its stomach would be, and another had a pair of old \noxygen tanks standing in for lungs. They were completely still, but there was \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 149 – Concrete Jungle \n8 \n \nsomething about them that made my mouth dry up and my mind scream to \nrun. It didn’t feel like they were statues. It felt like they were choosing not to \nmove. \nDr Anastas didn’t seem to have the same unease with the situation as me and \nFernanda, as he examined and prodded the figures with apparent delight. \nMaybe he thought avant-garde jungle art was just something that happened \nout there, I don’t know. I never got a chance to ask him, because suddenly he \nwas cooing with delight at something he’d picked up off the ground. The \nground, I could now see, was simply a half inch of loose dirt over the top of a \nmassive plastic tarpaulin. He came over to show us his discovery. It was a \nchunk of concrete that appeared to be the exact size and shape of a tiny pit \nviper, even down to the detail on its head. The doctor seemed quite taken with \nit, but Fernanda immediately sensed something was wrong and stepped back, \npulling me with her. \nWhat happened then was almost too quick for me to properly follow. The \nlifeless concrete viper spun around, opened its mouth, and bit Dr Anastas on \nthe wrist. He screamed, but only for a second, because after that his throat \nwas full. He started convulsing, as grey, liquid concrete began to pour from his \nmouth, from his nose and his eyes. His limbs went rigid and I could see his \nbody starting to swell with it. I don’t know if it was me or Fernanda screaming, \nmaybe it was both of us, but I know it was her that first spotted that the \ndetritus figures were no longer choosing to stand still. That was the last I ever \nsaw of Dr Nikos Anastas. There was never any question of trying to save him. \nI don’t know how long we ran, but it was hours before we felt even remotely \nsafe. The jungle looked normal again, and more importantly, it sounded \nnormal.
