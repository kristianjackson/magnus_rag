He breathlessly talked of his revelation. Then he \ndied, as did the man who came to bury him.” \nSo yeah, I reckoned it might be right up your street. Consider the book a \ndonation. It’s not quite as cool as having a real close encounter of my own but \nit’s the next best thing. Be careful carrying it, though, those old pages are kind \nof sharp. \nARCHIVIST \nStatement ends. \nMr Russo was found dead in his home on June 5th 2003, two days after his \nstatement. Cause of death was found to be blood poisoning from a wound in \nhis hand. Given that the medical records Sasha dug up seem to indicate the \nputrefaction was far more advanced than the timeframe would reasonably \n\nallow, I have a suspicion that Mr Russo may have gotten a far closer encounter \nthan he realised with a very dangerous book. A Leitner, I would guess, though \nsome slight charring around the edges of this statement leads me to believe \nthat Gertrude may have made a somewhat unilateral decision about disposing \nof it, rather than committing it to storage. \nBeyond that all the details seem more or less accurate. Sir Frederick Treeves \ndid indeed work in a field hospital during the Second Boer War, and did write a \nbook about it titled The Tale of a Field Hospital, published in 1900. Tim hunted \ndown an online version of the text, and it certainly doesn’t match up with what \nMr Russo reproduced here. Interestingly, the official text makes no mention \nwhatsoever of the concentration camps used to imprison Boer civilians during \nthe conflict, where sickness and hunger killed tens of thousands and, indeed, it \nis perfectly possible it was not part of the war Treeves encountered or engaged \nwith. Odd, then, that whatever thing it was that haunted him would choose \nthat as its final message. \nAmherst is rapidly becoming one of an uncomfortably long list of names that I \ndread seeing in a statement. Could this be an ancestor of John Amherst? Or, \ngiven the many apparent deaths of the soldier in the book, might it be the \nsame being, well over a hundred years old? If so, I wonder how many times it \nhas died of sickness and disease. Another point is a link that Treeves brings up \nwhich I had not considered, that of Jeffrey Amherst, an 18th century baronet \nwho is most remembered for deliberately providing blankets infected with \nsmallpox to Native American tribes during the so-called French & Indian Wars, \nleading to a devastating epidemic. A connection to a very different sort of \nmonster, but still one that has the trappings of disease. I had assumed that \nAmherst was something similar to Prentiss in his connection to insects, but \n\nthat may not be all. Insects and disease. No clear connection, other than the \nfact that they somehow feel similar. They both make one feel distinctly \nunclean. \nEnd recording. \n[Tape clicks off.] \nSupplemental. \nI’m in the tunnels. I was exploring and I got lost. I haven’t gone down any of \nthe stairs and I- I think I’m still under the Institute. There were a couple of \nspiders, so I changed routes and found, I think it’s a gas main. Must be for the \nwhole building. But there’s someone coming and I- I don’t know who else \nwould be down here, except... I mean, whatever’s down here. It was… it was \njust checking on the upper levels, I didn’t prepare for- \nNOT!SASHA \nJon? \n(The Archivist makes a startled noise.) \nJon is that you? \nARCHIVIST \nOh, Sasha, thank god. I thought you- I thought you were a... I don’t know. What \nare you doing down here? \nNOT!SASHA \nForgot my coat. I noticed the trap door was open and wanted to make sure \nyou were ok.
