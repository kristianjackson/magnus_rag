It’s like a… a Web-Vast team-up? \nARCHIVIST \nAlmost, but… no. It… It’s different. Something else. Either way the important \nthing is that right now, I can’t see it at all. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 195 – Adrift \n \n17 \nBASIRA \nSo we know they’re there with the magic camera. \nARCHIVIST \nExactly. \nBASIRA \n(Sighs) And we’re charging off into the unknown again? It’s just like old times. \nARCHIVIST \nOld times wasn’t actually all that long ago. \nBASIRA \nHmm. True. Feels it, though doesn’t it? \nARCHIVIST \nWell, hopefully this one will go a bit better. \nBASIRA \nWould be hard for it to go worse. \nARCHIVIST \nYeah. \n(Beat) \nSo… how was the trip down? How are you doing? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 195 – Adrift \n \n18 \nBASIRA \nNot great. But I think I’m doing better having done it. \nARCHIVIST \nYeah? \n[Basira slows and pauses her rowing while contemplating] \nBASIRA \nI always used to think I was helping people get what they deserved you know? \nBut then you see people suffering like this, with their deepest fears \neverywhere, and it’s people who I’d say were good people, or bad people or... \nAnd there are avatars, jailors and torturers, and some of them seem to hate it \nas much as the people they’re guarding. But they still do it... \n[Back to normal rowing] \nBASIRA (CONT’D) \nI don’t know. I guess it’s… It’s hard to look back on what I did as all that \ndifferent. \n(Bitter laugh) Bit late for self-discovery though, right? After the world’s ended? \nARCHIVIST \nWe’re still here. \nBASIRA \nTrue. But I don’t really know what I even am anymore. Am I an avatar, or \nwhat? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 195 – Adrift \n \n19 \nARCHIVIST \nTechnically… yes. I think you might have effectively inherited Daisy’s role. \nThat’s very much The Hunt’s thing, isn’t it — you kill, and then you become? \nBASIRA \n(Mournfully) Yeah. \nARCHIVIST \nSorry ah; what I mean is, Daisy moved through the domains, tormenting you \nwith the chase, but also spreading fear wherever she went, and watching the \nresults with hungry eyes. I think that’s what you’re doing now: travelling \nthrough, seeing places, and feeding The Eye with your observations. And your \nrevulsions. \nBASIRA \n(Exhales) So I’m what? Just a freelance watcher? \nARCHIVIST \nIf you like. You’ll probably end up with your own domain, eventually. \n[Basira pauses rowing] \nBASIRA \nBut if it’s The Hunt, what am I supposed to be chasing? All I’ve been doing is \nwandering around, hoping I might find something to do, some way to help— \nAh. \nDamn it. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 195 – Adrift \n \n20 \nARCHIVIST \nAnd there it is. \n[Rowing restarts] \n(Beat) \nBASIRA \nSo catch me up. What’s been happening? You found Melanie and Georgie? \nARCHIVIST \nUh, they found me. \nBASIRA \nSo I was right, then? \nARCHIVIST \nI don’t know what you mean. \nBASIRA \nYeah, you do. Just after that meat factory, we were talking, and I said maybe \nyou couldn’t see them because Georgie couldn’t feel fear and Melanie had cut \nherself off from The Eye. And then you said that— \nARCHIVIST \nI said it was plausible. \nBASIRA \nYeah, but you did the face when you said it. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 195 – Adrift \n \n21 \nARCHIVIST \nFine. You were right. \nBASIRA \nSo does this mean there are others? \nARCHIVIST \nWhat do you mean? \nBASIRA \nLike, they can’t be the only ones like that, right? Maybe there are other people \nout there, naturally immune, wandering around or hunkered down? \nARCHIVIST \nUh, maybe. I mean, probably. But, y’know, well, I can’t see them, can I? \nBASIRA \nAh, yeah. Suppose not. \n(Beat) \nARCHIVIST \nI also killed Helen? \nBASIRA \nOh. \nRight. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 195 – Adrift \n \n22 \nARCHIVIST \nYeah. \n(Beat) \nBASIRA \nDidn’t expect that. \nARCHIVIST \nShe was dangerous. And not like the others out there. It was only going to be a \nmatter of time before— \nBASIRA \nNo, no, I get it. \nHonestly, it’s kind of a relief. How did Melanie take it? \nARCHIVIST \nMelanie? \nBASIRA \nYeah. She and… She and Helen were pretty tight back when, uh… Oh. \nARCHIVIST \nWhat? \nBASIRA \nBack when you were in your coma.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 4, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 4056}}
