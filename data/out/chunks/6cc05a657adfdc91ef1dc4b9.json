And they were gone. I found water among their possessions \nand a small bag of rotten rice, and relishing the chance to wash the taste of \nblood from my mouth, I ate. I could still hear my would-be captors’ voices, and \nI wondered how long it would be that I still had to wait for death. \nSome choose not to wait, of course. I passed by the city of Hangzhou after it \nhad fallen to the Taiping. The gate still stood open, as they were unable to \nclose it for the dead. When the city was taken, the people had rushed out and \nthrown themselves bodily into the West Lake. It was solid with them. For three \nhundred yards you could have walked along their still bodies into the middle of \nthe waters. I did, hoping against all hope that an arm might reach out and \n\nfinally pull me down into that great mass of quiet death. But the waters of the \nlake were still and dark, and as I left, some who lay upon it rose to join me. \nI have no idea where to go now. I have walked so long my feet are bleeding, \nand I see nothing upon the horizon but more slaughter. More days without the \nliving. So I write this, that some small record of what I have done and what I \nhave seen may continue on. I sit here upon the steps of a Manifest Loyalty \nShrine, a small provincial one, erected by a local governor who wished to \ncement his power now the more central shines can no longer keep up with the \nnumber of the dead. But this one is mine. I look at the names of the fallen \nengraved on the walls, the long and storied lists, and I know that each name is \nborne by one of those that follow me. It is the list of those that wait for me at \nthe bottom of these steps, though whether they wait to follow me further or \nto finally descend upon me, I do not know. But my name will never be carved \nupon this stone. \nThough war and death have found me in this land, I have no place here. I came \nfor no cause but violence and greed, and have been humbled by the \nunimaginable brutality of true and total war. I have nothing left, except to \nhope that what remains of my own life is neither long nor memorable. \nARCHIVIST \nStatement ends. \nGood Lord. I had heard that the Taiping Rebellion was... but that... I wonder \nhow much of what Lieutenant Fleming says is true and how much is, uh... \nI almost hope it’s all supernatural. Some hideous hallucination or otherworldly \nhellscape. Part of me really doesn’t want to look it up. \n\nIt looks like Xiaoling was right though. No Circus. \nNothing even that resembles the working of The Stranger. It… it seems to be \npurely war and violence, whatever power that might be. So why did Gertrude \nwant it? I feel like… I’ve chased dead end to dead end until I finally give up. I-I \nmean, what am I actually looking for? Gerard Keay, after he faked his death? \nSome long confession he left tucked away in a library somewhere, telling me \nthe ancient chant I need to stop the Unknowing from coming to pass? \n(Sigh) Maybe this is pointless. I should head home, help the others in their \nresearch. If I knew Mandarin or Cantonese, maybe I could look here for more \nanswers, but as it is these files... Hang on, I think... I think this says 2004. Yes, \n1992... 1997... 2004. If I’m reading this right, this file hasn’t been accessed for... \nwait. Ohhhh... \n[Tape clicks off. Tape clicks on.] \nARCHIVIST \nSo it’s been a waste of time then, has it? \nXIAOLING \nIt was a very simple mistake. She did read that statement. \nARCHIVIST \nI mean, in 2004, yes, but I-I need information about her visit three years ago. \nDid, did your assistant find anything about that? \nXIAOLING \nYes. There were two accounts that Gertrude took out in 2014. \n\nARCHIVIST \nA-And can I read them? \nXIAOLING \nAccording to our records, we don’t have them anymore. \nARCHIVIST \n(Sigh) Well, Wh-what happened to them? Where are they? \nXIAOLING \nApparently, they were sent on at the request of the Magnus Institute. \nARCHIVIST \nGertrude asked for them t-to, to be sent to her? \nXIAOLING \nI believe so. \nARCHIVIST \nTo the Institute or...? \nXIAOLING \nNo, we have other channels of delivery for that. \nARCHIVIST \nThen where? \nXIAOLING", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 3, "chunk_count": 5, "chars": 4162}}
