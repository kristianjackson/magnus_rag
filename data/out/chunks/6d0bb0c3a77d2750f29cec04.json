By the time it was due to start shooting, \nhe’d already begun to seize up. I became his carer a few months later. It just \nseemed to make sense. A frugal life, lucrative career and prickly personality \nhad left him with lots of money, but no real support; while my life had left me \nin a position where I cared deeply about his wellbeing and was in desperate \nneed of money. Everything just lined up so neatly. \nI will say this once, and you can draw whatever conclusions you wish from it. \nNeil Lagorio did not have Parkinson's disease. He began to have difficulty \nmoving, yes, but his mind remained razor sharp at all times, and his growing \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 136 – The Puppeteer \n10 \n \nimmobility at no point seemed to cause him any pain or discomfort. It was \nsimply that, over the course of several years, he stopped being able to move \nunder his own power. The doctors were never able to name it anything other \nthan Parkinson’s, and I’ll admit I’m no expert, but I know they were wrong. \nWhen it started, I was worried that Neil would take the loss of his work very \nhard. It had been all he was for so long, surely being unable to continue would \ndevastate him. Instead, he threw himself into a new project, one I would never \nhave expected, but that suited my engineering background perfectly. \nNeil had devised a series of frames, ropes and pulleys, to be constructed in the \nrooms and corridors of his home. At the end of these ropes were hooks, which \nslotted into harnesses, again of his own design, that he wore on his wrists, his \nneck, his torso and his legs. When properly built and attached, it allowed me to \nmove him, without a wheelchair or my own support. I could stand him up and \nwalk him like a puppet. \nI protested, of course. This man was my hero – I loved him – and there was no \nway I could subject him to this awful indignity. But my objections were \nignored, as always, and Neil insisted that this was what he wanted. So, I built \nthat strange contraption, using the skills I had developed across my whole life, \nto fill every corner of Neil Lagorio’s house with wood and steel and cable. And \nwhen it was all done and I pulled him through his first, jerky standing motions, \nit did seem to make him happy. Pulling on those levers and cords, moving him \nstep by stiff-limbed step through his house, it was the first time I had seen Neil \nsmile in years. \nAnd so that became our life. For almost a decade, I went to his home every \nday, strapped him up, and gradually puppeted my idol through whatever \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 136 – The Puppeteer \n11 \n \nstrange, mimed parody of domestic life he desired. I still had to feed him, had \nto wash him, but he would always insist his arm be hoisted to his mouth before \nI fed him a sandwich, or that I correctly position him in the bath. And gradually, \nthe surreal gave way to the mundane, and it simply became our life. I barely \neven noticed when the harnesses were no longer necessary, when the loops \nfor those hooks were now embedded directly into his body. I must have asked \nhim about it, but at the time it just seemed like such a natural progression. \nIt was almost six months ago when the woman came to our door. She looked \nlike a film student, and at first, I took her for a fan. Neil’s work wasn’t the sort \nto attract adoring masses, but occasionally admirers would find their way to his \nhome. Usually he’d send them away, but sometimes he’d have them wait in \nthe atrium while I positioned him in his studio, ready for a short meeting or \nQ&A session. I was about to ask her to wait while I checked with him, but as I \nstarted to speak, she turned her head, revealing a mass of white thread criss-\ncrossing all over the side of her temple, standing starkly against the dark \nbrown of her skin. She told me to sit down, and I did. I heard the levers and \npulleys move behind me, and I could tell that Neil was being walked down the \ncorridor towards this woman, but I couldn’t see. I couldn’t turn my head, so I \ndon’t really know what his reaction was, but it didn’t sound like one of fear or \ndespair. \nHe called her Annabelle, and she sent me to his screening room. She told me I \nwas to watch his original cuts. “Just until we’re all done here,” she said. And as \nI walked away from Neil, the last time I saw him alive, he was dancing, the \ncables shifting and moving him in a graceful, sweeping ballet. And he was \ncrying with joy. \nI don’t kn", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 4, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 4500}}
