It was a \ncomplicated thing, built on well over a decade of disdain and interdependence. \nIn many ways I was closer to him than his wife, not that I ever touched the \nodious little freak, and while those film obsessives that insist I basically \ndirected all his films do us both a disservice, it is true that without me he would \nnever have reached the fame and high regard he enjoys. Enjoyed. \n \nCinematographer. Such an ornate word, yet still so vague. I often wonder if \nthat’s to blame for how overlooked we are as a profession. Or even worse, that \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG110 – Creature Feature \n \n2 \n \ndry title, “Director of Photography”. But we are the true artists. A director may \nquite literally call the shots, but it is the cinematographer that makes them. \nWe choose the angles, the lighting, pretty much everything you see on the \nscreen. If the camera is a brush, then we are the hand, the arm, the eye. The \ndirector is basically just the mouth, making pointless noise while the hand does \nthe actual work. Almost every famous director that you know with a \n“distinctive visual style” has simply managed to lock down a talented DOP. \n \nI first worked with Dexter back in 1997, working as cinematographer on Red \nRonin. It feels odd to say now, but I was genuinely excited to work with him at \nthe time. I’d seen some of his earlier work – Wasteland Seven, Dolores, maybe \na couple of shorts – and I remember thinking how refreshing it was going to \nbe, working with a director who really got films, who was steeped in their \nhistory and drew inspiration from forgotten corners of the medium. Even some \ncorners that should have stayed forgotten. \n \nUnfortunately, that turned out to be the only thing he understood. You see, \nDexter Banks lived movies. As far as I could tell, every single aspect of his life \nhad revolved around them. His dad had owned a small cinema near Fairfax \nAvenue and as a teenager he’d bounced between working there and a small \nrental store that specialised in foreign films, specifically Italian horror movies \nand East Asian martial arts. I never met anyone who knew as much about films, \nand as little about anything else. \n \nWorking with him, it soon became clear that all he was interested in doing was \nrecreating things he had seen. Taking scenes and music that he loved from \nthose old obscure corners of cinema, and then constructing whatever", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 0, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 2957}}
