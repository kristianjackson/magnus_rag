There is also a murder \nreport concerning one Alard Dupont, whose partially burned corpse was found \nin his home on August 2nd 1982. Unfortunately Mr. Herbert was never able to \ngive details of others, so we cannot corroborate further. \nThere was, however, a small bag left on top of this statement, which appears \nto contain six shark teeth of varying sizes. According to correspondence with \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG010 – Vampire Killer \n14 \n \nthe Zoology Department at King’s College, they didn’t match any currently \nknown species. \nPersonally, I don’t know what to think. I certainly don’t believe in wild tales of \nvampirism, but I can’t help but notice that the statement above appears to be \na photocopy of a photocopy, and can’t find these supposed vampire teeth \nanywhere in the Archives or the Secure Containment Room. I don’t know \nwhere the originals are but the file number is listed among multiple \ninformation requests from the Institute’s government and law enforcement \ncontracts. It may be that they take Mr. Herbert’s statement far more seriously \nthan I do \nEnd Recording. \n[The Magnus Archives Theme - Outro] \n \nThe Magnus Archives is a podcast distributed by Rusty Quill and licensed under \na creative commons attribution, non-commercial share alike 4.0 international \nlicense.
