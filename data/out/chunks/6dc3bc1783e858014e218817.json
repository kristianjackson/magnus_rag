The cold bites through my skin and feels \nas though it cuts into my very soul and I am so hungry that I can barely stand, \nbut I shall not give in. I can hear him taunting me still, tempting me, but I shall \nchoose to die rather than take part in such an unholy meal. Nor shall I take my \nown life, whatever extremity my suffering may reach. I am certain my final \nreward will come soon and I shall face my Saviour with a clear conscience and \na heart full of faith. Pastor Lawrence once told me that there are no empty \nbellies in Heaven, and I am sure that he is right. I wonder if I shall see Benjamin \nthere. I should hope so, for all his faults and his incessant chatter, and, \ntogether with all those we have lost, I am sure we shall look down upon \nperdition and watch Eustace Wick writhing in agony among the well-earned \nflames. \nSpeaking of flames, I must apologise about the state of the paper to whoever \nmay be discovering this message. I am having to write this close to what fire \nthere is, both for light and to stop the ink from freezing. There will likely be \nsome scorching, but I should hope it remains legible. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 058 – Trail Rations \n \n3 \n \n \nWe should never have attempted the Oregon Trail; I see that now. I should \nhave stayed in Savannah and built what life I could, maybe accepted the \nproposal of Adam Hawthorne. He was a decade my senior, but I heard no \ncomplaints from his previous wife while she lived and it would have been a \nbetter fate than to freeze to death in these mountains, listening to Benjamin’s \nincessant taunting. But my life before had been hardship and travel and there \nwas a part of my soul that felt that such a thing was simply my lot. So when my \nfather joined my mother in Heaven, not three years after moving us to the \nsmall town of Savannah, Missouri, it felt as though moving again was what the \ngood Lord intended for me. \nIt was then, as I had to choose between trying to scrape a living from 20 acres \nof Missouri soil that my father had left me, or forge out on my own, that \nBenjamin Carlisle kindly asked permission to repair his wagon on my land. I will \nnot deny he was a handsome man. Even now, the cold has preserved that \npleasing cast of his face, gaunt though it may be. I was somewhat taken with \nhim, but had no further thoughts about it, being somewhat plain in my own \nappearance. It took me quite aback when I brought a jug of water to his fire \nthat evening and he asked me directly if there was anywhere in the town of \nSavannah where he might find a wife.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 0, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 3383}}
