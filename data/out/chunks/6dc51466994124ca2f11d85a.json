Gabriel gave me \na sheepish smile and returned to whatever it was he was working on. Ray \nseemed absolutely delighted to see me and made such a big show of it that I \ndidn’t really feel like I could just turn around and leave. I asked him if he’d got \nmy email, and he nodded emphatically as he ushered me over to my table, but \ndidn’t elaborate. Bill gave me a slightly pained smile, but when I asked if he \nwas alright, he just shrugged and told me he couldn’t complain. There was no \nsign of Mary. They still haven’t found her. \nSo, I started to work. Ray told us the lesson was faces. I put my hand up to say \nthat sculpting faces was probably a bit advanced for where we were in the \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 126 – Sculptor’s Tool \n6 \n \ncourse, but he shook his head and said that we were a lot more talented than \nwe thought. He said the key was that faces were twisted. All faces were \ntwisted on the inside, and all you had to do was reach into the deepest part of \nyourself and put that twisted on the outside of the clay and, as soon as you can \nscream, you’ll have your own face staring back at you. I asked him to clarify \nand he nodded again. ‘Soon as you can scream,’ he said, glancing over \nnervously to Gabriel, who gave him a big thumbs up, like it was all some joke \nthey were playing. It didn’t feel like a joke, let me tell you. \nI did my best, prodding and shaping the clay, trying to do a face. And I think I \nactually made a pretty good stab at it, given how unhelpful our instructions \nhad been. I mean, it had two eyes, a mouth and something that might \ncharitably have been called hair. I asked Ray for his expertise, but he was just \nstanding at the front of the room, smiling and nodding. The face Bill was \nworking on looked like Mary, although he’d made her mouth much, much too \nwide. To be honest, it gave me quite a shock to see. \nThen I heard that shuffling sound from the other side of the room and I knew \nGabriel was walking towards me, no doubt holding some unpleasant new \nshape he’d formed just for me. He coughed gently and, well, I suppose it would \nhave been rude not to look. \nThe structure he held in his hands made my eyes hurt. Thin, sharp lines angling \noff from each other in an incredibly intricate arrangement, although they never \nseemed to actually connect with each other. It shifted like the other one and I \nfelt something jabbing at my skull like a migraine. Finally, the lines seemed to \nresolve into a clear shape: a door. \n“Perfect!” Gabriel told me. “It looks just like him.” \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 126 – Sculptor’s Tool \n7 \n \nI asked him if it was supposed to be a face, and he told me yes, it was a good \nfriend of his. I asked him who, and he said they didn’t have a name. I told him \neveryone has a name, and he said his friend wasn’t like us, that having a name \nwould only confuse them. \nMy head was pounding. I looked over at Ray, still nodding and smiling, and \nthen over at Bill, who was steadily shovelling fistfuls of the clay Mary into his \nmouth. I don’t remember anything more of that lesson. \nThe last lesson was on Monday. It wasn’t watercolours, and never had been, \naccording the schedule I had been obsessively checking so much that Rosa had \nstarted to get worried. \nThe room was larger than I remembered, although it didn’t need to be, \nbecause there weren’t any tables. Ray was there at the front, but he was \nsinging something in a high tenor that I couldn’t make out. I tried to ask him \nwhat we were doing for the lesson, but he just sang louder. \nBill was there, but he was made of clay, his limbs being worked and twisted by \nGabriel into strange, spiralling shapes, and occasionally joined into new and \nimpossible positions. As soon as Gabriel spotted me, he hopped up and hurried \nover to me. He grabbed my hand in a firm, damp grip and started to thank me. \nI was the best assistant he could have asked for, he said, he’d improved so \nmuch because of me. \nAs he said this, the structure beneath his face shifted, pushing it further and \nfurther from where his skull should have been, and behind his teeth, at the \nedges of his eyes, I saw the dull red of shifting clay. His smile kept getting \nwider, and bending in on itself at the edges, and where his fingers touched the", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 3, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 4276}}
