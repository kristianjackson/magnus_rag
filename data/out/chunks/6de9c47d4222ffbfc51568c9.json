As I recall it goes, “Once \nmet the duke, ‘bout midnight in a lane behind St. Mark’s church, with the leg \nof a man upon his shoulder. Said he was a wolf. Only difference was, a wolf’s \nskin is hairy on the outside, his on the inside”. Looking at this thing that \nwanted to kill me, it’s the only way it’s the only description that feels right. \nHe didn’t charge this time, but slowly stalked towards me. I was… acutely \naware of the loaded guns by my feet, but I’d seen how fast it could move and I \ndidn’t rate my chances. It got close. Close enough that I could smell the foetid \nbreath. Close enough that I could see the most disturbing thing illuminated by \nthe moonlight: the slick drool on its lips as it salivated in anticipation of a kill. \nThen it attacked me. I am, in some ways, very proud of how I acted during that \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG031 – First Hunt \n9 \n \nencounter. You see, as long as the thing didn’t think I was any sort of threat, I \nhoped it might get sloppy and clearly telegraph its strike. I was right; it drew \nback its arm and swung a clumsy, triumphant blow. I forget, did I mention my \nmilitary background? Well, I used to be an officer in the Air Force. Now, it’s \nbeen a long time since the Gulf War, and I didn’t do much in the way of hand-\nto-hand fighting even then, but the training is something that stays with you. It \ncertainly served me well for this one, desperate move, as I caught his arm and \npitched his motion around. His claws dug into my shoulder, but missed my \nneck, and he fell to the floor, tripped by his own momentum. He began to get \nto his feet almost immediately, but it brought me the precious seconds to grab \nmy rifle and press it to his chest. I didn’t hesitate. \nThe shot ripped through him and he jerked in pain. Not wanting to take any \nchances, I fired again and again and again until my rifle was empty. Then I \npicked up Arden’s rifle and emptied that one into him as well. \nEven after all of that, he still wasn’t dead. He had three bullets in his heart, two \nin his head and many more through the rest of him, but still he writhed there, \nmaking weak noises. I didn’t know how long this would slow him down for, but \nI hoped it would give me enough time to escape properly. I looked back as I left \nthe clearing to see him slowly and painfully pushing his claws into his chest, \ndigging for the bullets. \nIt was luck that saved me, in the end. Some park rangers were driving past our \ntrail on a road about two miles distant. They were coming to investigate the \ngunshots and I stumbled on to the road through sheer good fortune. I never \nsaw that thing again, or Arden, unfortunately, though they managed to find \nand recover his body about a week later. I don’t think I’ll try hunting again.
