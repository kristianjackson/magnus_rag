I... maybe. Maybe you did. I don't know. \nELIAS \nJohn, this is absurd. This goes far beyond an unhealthy work environment. I'll \nadmit it's partly my fault for letting it get this bad. I, I should have stepped in \nearlier. \nTIM \nYou still don't believe us, do you? \nARCHIVIST \nIt's not that I don't believe you, it's just... I mean, you could have done it. \nTIM \nSeriously? Listen to yourself. \nMARTIN \nIt's not right! \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 060 – Observer Effect \n \n15 \n \nARCHIVIST \nWe've gone a long way beyond right, Martin. There are monsters out there \nand I don't know who or where they are or if any of you... if you want me to \ntrust you, then I'm sorry, but I need evidence. \nELIAS \n(Sigh) Here. \nARCHIVIST \nAnd this is? \nELIAS \nA copy of all the CCTV from the week Gertrude disappeared. The police finally \nfinished cleaning it up and examining it, and returned a copy. \nARCHIVIST \nThere aren't any cameras in the Archive. \nELIAS \nBut there are everywhere else, including all of the entrances into the Archive \nand across all of the feeds. It provides a remarkably detailed account of all of \nour movements over that week, even yours. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 060 – Observer Effect \n \n16 \n \nARCHIVIST \nAnd you think this gives everyone an alibi? \nELIAS \nThe police certainly do, but feel free to check it yourself. \nARCHIVIST \nThank you. I will. \nNOT!SASHA \nAnd let's have no more of this paranoia. \n[Tape clicks off. Tape clicks on.] \nARCHIVIST \nI've been examining the CCTV feeds Elias gave me. It… it does seem to provide \neveryone with a solid alibi and no one is seen entering or exiting the Archives \nexcept Gertrude, at least not before Elias goes down and discovers the blood. \nGertrude's own movements are somewhat erratic, and she seems to be in and \nout of the Archives at all hours of the day and night, at some points looking \nrather dishevelled. That could stand closer scrutiny later, but for now I… I can't \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 060 – Observer Effect \n \n17 \n \nquite figure out whether this exoneration of my colleagues is more of a relief \nor a frustration. \nAt the very least, it seems I have been… I have been rather unfair to them. I \njust hope they haven't entirely lost respect for me. \nOne thing that does nothing to ease my mind though is the renewed \nsignificance this puts on the tunnels beneath the Archive, as it seems more and \nmore likely that whoever or whatever is living down there is the same thing \nthat killed Gertrude. \nEnd supplemental. \n[Tape clicks off.] \nThe Magnus Archives is a podcast distributed by Rusty Quill and licensed under \na Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Sharealike 4.0 International \nlicence. \nToday’s episode was written by Jonathan Sims and directed by Alexander J \nNewall. \nIt featured: Jonathan Sims as The Archivist, Ben Meredith as Elias Bouchard, \nAlexander J Newall as Martin Blackwood, Mike LeBeau as Tim Stoker and \nEvelyn Hewitt as Not!Sasha", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 5, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 3236}}
