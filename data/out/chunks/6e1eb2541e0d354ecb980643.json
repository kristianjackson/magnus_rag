It was the smell of our \ndeath. Antonio turned to me without a word, gripped my hand in his, and \nkissed me once on the forehead. Then he walked to edge of the cliff and hurled \nhimself over the edge. I didn’t look down after him. Truth be told, I envied him \nhis resolve. \nI walked into the cave. The drummer boy might have followed after me, or he \nmight have joined Antonio. I never turned around; he was the last thing on my \nmind. The cave was a long way from natural, forming a smooth but uneven \ntunnel heading deep into the mountain. It narrowed slightly as I descended, \n\nuntil I was stooped, half-walking, half-crawling along the floor. The smell \nseemed milder inside, but I don’t know if it was truly less, or I had already \ngrown accustomed to it. \nThe texture of the earth beneath my hands changed so gradually I barely \nnoticed, and the torch I had brought was too weak to show anything more \nthan a few inches in front of me. The first moment I realised what the tunnel \nhad become was when I placed my hand fully over the cold and clammy skin of \nsomeone’s face. \nI pulled my hand back with a cry, and pushed my torch down to focus on what \nwas below me. It was a corpse, as I had thought. Its eyes were closed and its \nface was serene, but it was dressed in uniform, cut through and black with \nblood. It was Italian, I thought, but an old design, and not one I really \nrecognised. Shining my torch around, I saw more of them, half-buried in the \nwalls and ceiling. More dead faces, more uniforms, and not just Italian, either. \nI pressed on, trying to find gaps between the bodies where it was still dirt, \ntrying to avoid touching them. But those spaces became smaller and smaller, \nand the corpses were now piled two or three deep. It wasn’t long before the \none way forward was clambering over them, climbing along their stiff, \nunfeeling limbs. \nWhen they all opened their eyes, it was unhurried and deliberate. They were \nalready focused on me, as though they’d been following my progress from \nbehind closed eyelids. They were not cloudy like the woman at the cabin, but \nsharp and clear, slowly swivelling in their sockets to watch me climb over \nthem. They did not move. I believe, though, at one point they started to sing, \nbut that might just be in the nightmares I have since endured. \n\nWhen I reached the end of the tunnel, the deserter was waiting. He had his \nrifle pointed at me, and sat in a tiny hollow with nothing but a small pile of \nsoiled bandages and two dead rats. He was young, and so thin that for the \nbriefest of seconds I felt a deep pity for him. The mud caked on his face had \nlines carved through it where tears had fallen, but they hadn’t been shed for \nme. \nHe lifted his rifle, and prepared to kill me. I tried to raise my own, knowing with \na perverse sense of relief that I was too slow. He would pull his trigger before I \nwould pull mine. It was over. \nBut as I lifted the barrel to fire, I heard shots, five or six of them, ringing out in \nrapid succession. \nIn the closeness of the tunnel, they were deafening. The deserter slumped. He \nwas dead the moment the first shot sounded. Maybe even before that. For all \nhis gaunt frame and emaciated body, he hit the ground with a weight that \nseemed to shake the mountain. I’d never before witnessed a firing squad, and I \nnever care to again, although of course, I was alone in the tunnel. \nI left the deserter’s corpse there. Left the cave and the mountain. Left my \nhome and my country. \nEventually I came here, and I never want to return. That is my story. \nMARTIN \nS-S-Statement... done. \n(Martin takes deep, shakey breaths)", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 3, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 3756}}
