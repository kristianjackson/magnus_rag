No, I, uh, I know. \nMELANIE \nWell, I’ve kind of got to ... I’ve got somewhere to be. Do you mind if she hangs \naround with— \nARCHIVIST \nUh, I suppose ... Not at all. She’s very welcome. \nMELANIE \nGreat. \nARCHIVIST \n(Compelling) If you don’t mind me asking, where are you off to? \nMELANIE \nTherapy. Wait … \nARCHIVIST \nOh, God, Melanie, I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to ... \nMELANIE \nIt’s fine.

Are you ok? \nDAISY \nYeah. \nMELANIE \nRight, anyway, I’m running late, so, er, thank you. \nARCHIVIST \nAnytime. \n[Melanie leaves, shutting the door behind her] \nYou alright? \nDAISY \nAsked me that already. \nARCHIVIST \nRight. Sorry. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 136 – The Puppeteer \n5 \n \nDAISY \nI didn’t ask her. To do that. \nARCHIVIST \nIt’s fine. \nDAISY \nYou’re not babysitting me, alright? I know that’s what the others think \nsometimes, but that’s not it. I just don’t like being on my own if I can help it. \nYou know, flashbacks, panic attacks, the usual. Just trying to avoid it if I can. \nARCHIVIST \nI know, Daisy. I do. It’s hard. \nDAISY \nYeah, well. Don’t let me get in your way. \nARCHIVIST \nOf course. \n[The Archivist clears his throat] \nStatement of Alison Killala, regarding her time as friend and carer to special \neffects artist, Neil Lagorio. Original statement given 1st December 2012. Audio \nrecording by Jonathan Sims, the Archivist. \nStatement begins. \n \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 136 – The Puppeteer \n6 \n \nARCHIVIST (STATEMENT) \nI loved Neil. I might even have been in love with him; it’s hard to say. When \nthere are so many emotions caught up in a single person, when they’re such a \nsignificant force in your life, it gets difficult to say what’s really there at the \nheart of it. His work, his art, defined my early life, as his friendship defined the \nlast twenty years of it. One of my earliest memories is cowering behind my \nmother, watching Labyrinth of the Minotaur on our tiny television, seeing the \nclay of the creature move and come alive in stop-motion. It terrified me. It \nthrilled me. It’s a moment that’s never completely left me. \nI’ve always had two passions: engineering and special effects. So naturally, the \ncourse of my life gradually led me towards working on animatronics. I don’t \ncare about the other stuff, not really. A squib’s a squib, no matter how much \nyou dress it up, and make-up never really wowed me. Even pyrotechnics, while \nimpressive and visually spectacular, just didn’t give me the same sharp joy as \nmaking something that could move, that came alive, directed and controlled \nby my hand. I always felt Frankenstein should have been an engineer, not a \nmedical student, as reading that book, I couldn’t help but see some of myself \nin that obsession. But I suppose everyone’s already done the monster as a \nrobot, haven’t they? And none made it move as well as Neil did in 1975 when \nhe worked on Agents of Orion. \nThat was one of his movies that I went back to time and again. The way the \nrobot moved, the weight and life he managed to give each clanking, hissing \nstep. I was 14 when I managed to hunt down a copy on Betamax, and I just \nwatched that scene over and over again. I was already obsessed with Neil’s \nwork by then, mostly his sci-fi stuff from the late 70s: B", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 0, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 4500}}
