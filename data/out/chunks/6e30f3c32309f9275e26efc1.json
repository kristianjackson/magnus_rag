It took me a long time to make the connection with the \ncrate I had stumbled across in Salesa’s shipping container. I was so disoriented \nby my awakening that the idea that this was his doing took a surprisingly long \ntime to come. Once it did though, I began to feel rage building. I had the \nmemory of the lid that hadn’t been secured and, taking a moment to orientate \nmyself, I began to push up on the wood directly above me. It didn’t budge a \nmillimetre. Either it had been nailed down or someone had placed a heavy \nweight on top of it. Or both. I started to thrash around at that point, desperate \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 066 – Held in Customs \n \n6 \n \nto escape, but this only earned me more splinters. I suppose I was lucky that it \nwas winter and the thick pyjamas I had slept in, that I was apparently still \nwearing, protected me from a lot of it. \nAt the thought of winter, I began to notice the heat. It was hot in that tiny cell. \nA close, humid heat that caused sweat to trickle gently down my neck and my \nthroat gradually turned ragged and raw, and I could do nothing but sit there, \ncramped and desperate and feel that stifling, oppressive heat thrum around \nme. \nEverything about it was stifling and oppressive. I have never suffered from \nclaustrophobia before, but it didn’t take long for it to set in, and for a while I \ngave in to blind panic, muttering to myself and hyperventilating in shallow, \ngasping breaths of hot, sticky air. The thing that finally brought me out of it \nwas the realisation that if I’d been breathing so hard and for so long, but was \nstill conscious, that must mean there was air flow and that I wasn’t completely \nburied alive. That sudden moment of relief ended abruptly though, when, I \nswear, I felt the box get smaller. It was a slight movement, barely a centimetre, \nbut I felt it in a jolt of pain along my leg, like the crate had decided to punish \nme for my moment of hope. \nAfter a while, the cramps that had been so agonising to begin with began to \nfade in and out. It’s not that it stopped hurting, far from it, but it became such \na constant pain that I could ignore it for long periods of time before it washed \nback over me in a wave of screaming muscles. It was in such a window of \nnormality that I realised I was able to see my arms. There was light! It seemed \nto be seeping through the small gaps in the wood, barely enough to see by \nnormally, but my eyes had grown very accustomed to the dark. It looked like \nsunlight. I must have been outside, but I had no idea where I might be. Near \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 066 – Held in Customs \n \n7 \n \nmy head, a slightly larger space between the wooden slats let in a thin beam of \nsunlight near my head. I shifted, my neck protesting the movement, but for a \nsingle moment, I felt it on my face. That sunlight, a … a dream of freedom. \nThen the box closed the gap with a shudder and squeezed me a bit tighter for \ndaring to do so. \nStill, I knew I was outside, and I knew I had air, so I tried once again to scream \nfor help. I pleaded, I shouted, I felt my dry lips crack from the force of my \nscreams. I kept going until my voice was nothing but a hoarse whisper, and \nthen I collapsed back into despair and terror. \nAt 11.56, I realised I could see my watch. I wasn’t in the habit of taking it off for \nbed and the position I had been forced into left it just about visible in the dim \nlight. It was surprisingly little comfort, as the hours that had passed by in a \nhazy blur of pain and fear now ticked by with an awful slowness. Even so, it \ngrounded me, kept me focused on something real. The minutes and hours \npassed, same as they would have outside the box, and this, more than \nanything, convinced me that I was neither dreaming nor mad. \nAt 9.45 the light began to disappear, and I was once again in darkness. I slept \nthen, fitfully and in great pain, and when I woke back up to find myself still \ntrapped there, I cried. Even as I did so, in the back of my mind I hated myself \nfor wasting what water I might have left in me. \nFour days I was in there, at least, if the darkness and light really was night and \nday. I used to be religious and I tried to pray several times, but the words felt \nhollow on my dry, desperate lips. I called out to God, then later to the devil \nand finally to Salesa himself. None of them answered. I knew that that was \nwhere I was", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 3, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 4499}}
