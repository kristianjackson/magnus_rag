Statement... \nextracted from subject 3rd March 2018. Audio recording by Jonathan Sims, the \nArchivist. \nStatement begins. \nARCHIVIST (STATEMENT) \nWe started in a plague. Not like the nasty crawlers, but like bringing any other \ndoom. We had a cart of corpses, faces twisted, screaming, leaking pus. Knock \non doors and cry roughly to bring their dead to us. I tended the shrunken, \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 128 – Heavy Goods \n7 \n \nmangy mule, and he took the remains on shoulder, slinging them onto the \nstinking pile. I remember it clear, the fear on their faces as we rolled towards \ntheir hovels. Mud-caked peasant or bloated lord, every one of them saw us \ncoming and trembled. It wasn’t the plague they feared, it wasn’t the death that \nwaited in our wagon, it was us. Two strangers rolling towards them, \nunstoppable and uncertain, wearing faces they would only half remember, \nbringing a fate they would beg their god to forget. They could not hate us any \nmore than they might have hated the rock that falls on them from a crumbling \ncliff. They did not know us, but they knew what we might do to them, what we \nmight bring them. \nAnd we did. Villages that might have no bodies for us when we arrived would \npile high our cart before we left. We did not kill them, did not lift a finger. We \nwere the bringers of their awful fate, not its executors. They knew this and \nfeared us in kind. And we drank it down, the taste of it sweeter than the food \nthat now rotted on our plates or the drink that curdled in our cups. And we \nboth tasted it together. \nWhen we left our destination, the mule whining at the new weight behind it, \nhe would reach behind us and find a face, sagging, sloughing off its skull, and \nhe would pull it to him. He’d place it over the one he wore already and he \nwould laugh and laugh and laugh. Sometimes it fell off. Sometimes it stayed for \nweeks. I kept the face we chose, but I loved him for our levity. And the corpses \npiled ever higher. \nWe served aboard the Robert Small, bodies of the time crammed into uniform \nas sloppily as any would expect. Enlistment wasn’t needed, nor was drafting, \nwe were on the list for any crew that deserved us, and we were fitting \ndeckhands for the Robert Small as it made its slow and mournful passage to \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 128 – Heavy Goods \n8 \n \nAustralia. The quartermaster was too precise, though, and in counting out the \nrations saw us for what we were. I ate the quartermaster's pen; he ate the \nquartermaster’s tongue. And that was that. \nThe journey was magnificent. No waiting; no searching for a delivery. Every \nmoment moved us towards, towards the completion of the task and the \nculmination of our charges’ terror. Poor wretches who emerged from Millbank \nwith tales of Australia and its cruelties on their lips, bundled into the cramped \nand creaking ship that would drag them away from everything they loved and \ntowards everything they feared. That was the first time we saw what would \nbecome this place, The Eye’s pedestal, but we were drunk on the dawning \nhorror of transportation and took no heed of it. \nA young man named Jack tried to leap overboard. When he caught the lad, \nthere was such begging and pleading, as you’ve never heard, to just let them \ndrown, allow the sea to take it’s due. But he just laughed and laughed, and Jack \ndied on dry land as they had always been meant to. \nWe were conductors on a train, prim suits and scowls, a relentless beast of \nsteam and iron that never seemed to get you exactly where you wanted to be, \nunless there was something dreadful waiting for you. We punched tickets, \nignored questions, and threw off those that looked like they were having too \nfine a time of it. We didn’t like this job, too many sat aboard dreaming sweetly \nof progress and the future, too few alive to the truth of dirt and struggle in \nfront of them. We woke those we could, but too many stepped off with a \nsmile. \nWe had some luggage once, a thrumming, silk-wrapped thing of the Spider, \nhiding away in an old steamer trunk.
