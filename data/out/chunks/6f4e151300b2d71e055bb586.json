It was just standing there like it couldn’t approach, as Mike \nreached the crescendo of his invocation and with a cry of “I am yours” he leapt \nthrough the open window and presumably to his death. \nThe strange figure cried out, a sound like tearing sandpaper, and seemed to be \ndragged through the window with him. The sharp smell vanished instantly and \nI was alone in the dark. I say presumably about his jumping almost 100 feet to \nhis death, because when I went out I could find no body at the base of the \ntower and neither could the police who obviously treated me like a lunatic. \nWhen the sky cleared shortly afterwards, it became apparent that all the \nwindows to the bell chamber were closed and sealed. I never saw Michael \nCrew or the Leitner book again. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG046 – Literary Heights \n11 \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nStatement ends. \nMichael Crew, another name that seems to crop up more than once in relation \nto Leitners and twice regarding this particular volume. The events here seem \nto have taken place a couple of years after those of statement 9991006. Could \nhis exposure to The Boneturner’s Tale have catalysed an interest in Jurgen \nLeitner? Or perhaps an early experiment? \nIt seems as though he was attempting to use the book as protection against \nwhatever was chasing him. Did The Boneturner’s Tale not work in that regard? \nAnd what was it that chased him, bringing that smell with it? It is a shame that \nEx Altiora was burned in the end. I would have been fascinated to read it, \nespecially as there is one feature that I’m surprised Mr Knox did not mention, \ncomparing his statement to that of Dominic Swain in 0132806. The book Mr \nKnox received did not seem to have a woodcut of the dark night sky with the \nbranching, arching design of the Lichtenburg figure. \nEnd recording. \n[CLICK] \nSupplemental. \nSomeone else has been going down into the tunnels. When I came in \nyesterday, I noticed the trapdoor appeared to have been disturbed. It was \nunlocked. I confronted the others, but they all deny it, of course. Someone \nmust think there is more down there of value, unless they’re trying to hide \nsomething. Searching or hiding – it could be either. \nI might try to set up a camera to watch the trapdoor, if I can find somewhere \neffective to hide it. I did go down there to see if I could find anything, but it \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG046 – Literary Heights \n12 \n \nseems much as it did last time. The only difference now is all the spiderwebs; \nthey seem to have spread down there. I think I saw some of the larger \nspecimens actually eating the remains of the worms. It was a… disconcerting \nsight and I left almost immediately. \nEnd supplemental. \n[CLICK] \n[The Magnus Archives Theme - Outro] \n \nThe Magnus Archives is a podcast distributed by Rusty Quill and licensed under \na creative commons attribution, non-commercial share alike 4.0 international \nlicense.
