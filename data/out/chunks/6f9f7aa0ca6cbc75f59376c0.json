He’s all eyes. \nLook, I know that’s not— That’s my brain. I’m not blaming him for being in my \ndreams. You know, I guess I can’t— (sniffs) That’s absurd, right? It’s not— \nBut I feel like I’m seeing him when I’m awake as well. I’ve been... I’ve been \nhaving a lot of problems since he talked to me. Since I talked to him. Since I \ntold him my story. The, the claustrophobia, it’s back, worse than it ever was \nand I can’t do my job. I have these, these screaming panic attacks every time I \ntry and— \nWhat am I supposed to do? Like, feels like, like every time I’m even slightly \nunderground I— Can’t even go into a shop basement more without feeling \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 142 – Scrutiny \n \n9 \n \nthat... (sniffs) hand. Every time I do, every time I get that panic just rising up \nmy throat, I see him. He’s there. Not when I look properly, but just at the edge. \nThe corner of my eye. Then he’s gone. \nI mean, maybe, maybe it’s just me. Maybe, I’m— Maybe I just— I met him \nonce in a coffee shop, and he was a creep, and it messed me up. But that’s \nenough… right? That is enough. So… So I want to put in a complaint. Like a \nproper complaint. I don't want to go to the police. I mean, I doubt that they \nwould— They wouldn’t even, you know, let me get this far, would they? But— \nSorry. \nSo thanks, I guess. \nMARTIN \nOkay. Um… Right. Well, firstly I’m, I’m really sorry that this happened. Um, in, \nin terms of next steps— \nBYSTANDER \nJust— I just— I don’t know. You know? Talk to him, I guess, just tell him— \nLook, I mean that’s not okay! You know, right? I’m not— I don’t know what he \ndid, but it’s— You know, he can’t just go around and well— y’know, just keep \ndoing— \nMARTIN \nI, I understand. \nBYSTANDER \nGood. Well. You— I just— I don’t want to see him again, alright? Ever! \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 142 – Scrutiny \n \n10 \n \n[Footsteps] \nMARTIN \nWell, hold on, hold on, I just need to— \nBYSTANDER \nNo I— No! That’s it! That’s my complaint. You know, I, I, I can’t—This place, I— \nI can’t be here. I have to— Bye! \n[Door opens] \nMARTIN \nBut you didn’t give me your— \n[Door closes] \n—name. \n[Martin sighs a couple of times, rustles paper] \nWhat the hell do I do with that? I mean, Christ John, that’s not okay! \nOh, that can’t, that can’t... I mean it’s not him, is it? Not, not really. Is it… what, \naddiction? Instinct? Maybe mind control, something like that. I can’t believe \nhe’d choose to do something like that. \nNo, no. I can’t think like that though. I can’t let myself, cos I mean, if, if he’s \nalready gone then all of this is just— \n(Long sigh.) \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 142 – Scrutiny \n \n11 \n \nThe, the worst part is I don’t even want to talk to him about it. I’m just— I \nsuppose I’m just getting comfortable with the distance. Cut off. (Scoffs) Lonely. \nMind you, Peter’s not wrong. It really is easier than actually just trying to \ncommunicate with people. I should probably try to get him this tape. Let him \nknow what happened, that someone came in to— But then, heh heh, would \nthat just come across as an accusation? Like, cos I don’t want to— And then, \nthen I guess... he’d hear this bit as well so— \n[Exhausted exhalation] \nWhat do I do? \n[Three knocks on the door] \nMARTIN \n(Sighs) Go away. \n[Three knocks on the door] \nCome in! \n[Door opens and closes] \nDAISY \n(Softly) Hey. \nMARTIN \nUm… Hi? \nDAISY \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 142 – Scrutiny \n \n12 \n \nYou mind? \nMARTIN \nCa-can I help you? \nDAISY \nI, I saw someone come out, so I, I thought that, you know... \nMARTIN \nDo you want something? \nDAISY \nNo, I’m ju— Just ignore me. Continue with... whatever. \nMARTIN \nAre you alright? \nDAISY \nYeah. Just a, a bit empty round here. You know? \nMARTIN \nNot really. \nDAISY \nMelanie’s out, and John and Basira are still off. Bit worried, but they can take \ncare of themselves, you know? \nMARTIN \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 142 – Scrutiny \n \n13 \n \nAgain not really. No-one really talks to me anymore. \nDAISY \nCos they reckon you’re working for the bad guy? \nMARTIN \nPretty much. \nDon’t you? \nDAISY \nOh, I mean, you’re definitely working for something evil. But so are we. \nMARTIN \nYeah. Seems there’s plenty to go around these days. \nIt doesn’t bother you? \nDAISY \nDidn’t used to. \nMARTIN \nAnd now? \nDAISY \nBothers me less than trying to go alone. At least now it’s on my terms. Better \nthan being blackmailed into it. \nMARTIN", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 3, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 4386}}
