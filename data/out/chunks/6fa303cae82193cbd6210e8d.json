He smiled when I \nstammered out a hello, and asked if I was Ross from the phone. Sure, I said, \nand he immediately launched into all sorts of questions about my workout, \nwhat I was looking for, what safety measures I had for my steroids, that sort of \nthing. None of it was unexpected, and he clearly knew his stuff. \nBut then he started asking me some slightly more personal questions: why I’d \nbecome a bodybuilder, how it made me feel, what parts of myself I hated. It \nfelt a bit… invasive, but I answered honestly, and he seemed satisfied, turning \naround and gesturing for me to follow as he headed in to show me around. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG090 – Body Builder \n8 \n \nThe gym itself was good, but nothing special. It actually didn’t have much in \nthe way of cardio machines, but that had never really been my priority, so it \nwasn’t a problem. There was also quite a lot of old-fashioned gymnastics \nequipment: parallel beams, vaulting horses, high bars, all that sort of thing. It \nwas a huge room, and to be honest, part of me just assumed that they were \nthere to use up some of the space. It certainly had everything I needed, \nalthough I did wonder why we were the only ones in there. \nIt was the changing room that really struck me as odd, though. There was just \nthe one: apparently unisex, though I doubted any women were members. It \nwas decent size, and had plenty of showers, good water pressure, everything \nyou needed. It all seemed perfectly normal, except for one thing. \nThe lockers were absolutely enormous. They came right up to the ceiling, \nwhich was easily twelve foot from the floor, and must have been a good two or \nthree feet wide. Each had what looked to be a unique lock, and only a few of \nthem had keys in. \nMy guide explained that every member of the gym had their own locker, and \nkept it as long as they were a member. I asked what happened when all the \nlockers were taken and he just shrugged. “No new members,” he said. When \nhe shrugged, the fabric of his hoodie moved in such an odd way. It was \nfascinating, and I made a mental note to keep an eye out for him in the gym, so \nI could get a proper look at him. \nI walked over to one of the lockers with the key still in it, number 31, and \npulled it out. I looked back at him, and he nodded. The locker was just as big \ninside as I’d thought, and went back about five feet into the wall. Forget a \nworkout bag, I could have stored my entire wardrobe in that thing. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG090 – Body Builder \n9 \n \nAfter that, I headed back into the reception, and the guy took down my details, \nI signed a few forms and, just like that, I was a member. He told me to keep the \nkey, and explained that he preferred to have membership fees paid in cash. \nThat didn’t surprise me. I got the feeling that there were a few things about \nthe place that wouldn’t pass any sort of official audit. \nStill, it suited me perfectly, so I had no interest in causing them any sort of \ntrouble. I gave him a big thumbs up, and he nodded, turned and headed out \nthe doors, off down the street. It was a bit abrupt, but to be honest, I wasn’t \nsure he was all there, if you know what I mean, so I didn’t think too much of it. \nI did kick myself, though, as I realised I hadn’t actually got his name, so ‘J’ \nwould have to do. \nWith J gone, it seemed like I was the only one there, so I got changed, and got \non with my workout. It was a little bit eerie, being all alone in that huge room. \nI’m used to having the presence of others to motivate me, to push me further \nthan I’d otherwise go, just to show off a bit. On my own, I found myself \nworking out at a much more leisurely pace; I was more careful than I normally \nwould have been, if only because I didn’t have a spotter. \nThe whole day I kept expecting someone else to come in. We’d get chatting, I \nthought, and I could maybe ask them to spot me, but the day slowly passed, \nand I was still alone. Occasionally I heard a noise from the changing rooms that \nI would have sworn was someone coming in, but there was no-one. Eventually, \nI showered, changed back, and headed home for a less-than-exciting dinner of \nchicken and beans. \nThe next day was the same, and the one after that. No matter when I went, the \nplace was always empty, with no sign of J or anybody else. I wondered if", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 2, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 4400}}
