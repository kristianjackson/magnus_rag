I could find a \nbetter position once I was somewhere I spoke the language properly. \nI eventually found the captain in a small bar in one of the seedier areas of the \ndockside. I’d been told his name was Peter Lukas, but to be honest I wouldn’t \nhave needed his name – he was the only white guy in the place. Even by those \nstandards he was very pale, weirdly so for someone who apparently lived their \nlife on the sea. He sat there at a small table, completely alone, drinking a cup \nof black coffee. He was staring into the distance, and didn’t seem to notice \nanything going on around him. I sat down opposite and coughed. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG033 – Boatswain’s Call \n7 \n \nHis eyes only moved a fraction of an inch to focus on me, but it felt as though \nthe movement had the weight of a heavy stone door. Like a tomb. Don’t know \nwhy that’s what popped into my head, but there you go. I asked if he was Peter \nLukas, and he said, “Yes”. I’d gone blank on what to say next, and it was then \nthat I noticed the silence. I looked around to see that the place was now \ncompletely empty. Even the bartender was nowhere to be seen, and the only \nsound was the whir of the ceiling fans above us. The captain was still staring at \nme, so I swallowed my unease and began to explain my situation to him. I left \nout the part about the criminal possibilities of my last ship, but was clear that I \nwas in desperate need of a new post. When I had finished, he was quiet for a \nfew minutes. Then he nodded. \n“We have one space. Report tomorrow. At dawn.” That was all he said. And it \nwas all I needed. The Tundra wasn’t difficult to find when I headed to the \ndocks the next day. It was big, already stacked high with an array of colourful \nshipping containers. I wondered if they’d loaded it up overnight, as there didn’t \nseem to be much activity from the crane. It was early, and I was glad I was \nleaving Brazil before the wet season really got going, as the sky was \nthreatening to break. Making my way through the dock I asked around until I \nwas finally pointed to the mate. He was a short man, heavy set with a thick, \nblack beard. His warm, brown skin was stained darker by a life working in the \nsun, and he didn’t smile when he looked at me. Around his neck, I saw a chain \nending in a small brass ball and stem. It looked like an old boatswain’s call, an \nantique sailor’s whistle. \nI introduced myself, told him what I’d told the captain and gave my \nqualifications and experience. The bearded mate listened quietly until I \nfinished. Then he shrugged, and said they were in need of an Ordinary Seaman, \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG033 – Boatswain’s Call \n8 \n \nand I was welcome to the position if I wanted it. OS was a bit of a step down \nfor me, as I’ve been pulling Able Seaman pay for these last few years, but it \nwas a ticket out of Porto do Itaqui, so I jumped at the chance. The mate still \ndidn’t smile, but he did offer his hand and introduced himself in a gentle Dutch \naccent as Tadeas Dahl, First Mate of the Tundra. I was surprised, as it seemed a \nbit abrupt to be leaving, and I hadn’t even had time to stow away the duffel \nbag that was my only luggage. Still, I wasn’t about to disobey the first order I’d \nbeen given on a new ship. \nThe Tundra was pretty normal. I’ve served on a half dozen ships almost \nidentical to it, and I fell into my duties quickly. We set off almost as soon as I \nwas on board, and it was only later I discovered we were heading across the \nAtlantic towards Southampton. I was very happy to find that out, as I had \nassumed we’d be making plenty more stops before crossing back to England. \nWith any luck it wouldn’t be more than a couple of weeks before I was home, \nand those would be spent in maintenance, repainting and taking watches with \n‘Iron Mike’, the autopilot. \nSo that was fine, but I did start to notice a few things on board which didn’t \nreally seem to add up. The first was the crew. They were quiet. Very quiet. I \nmean, I’ve been on ships where I was pretty much the only native English \nspeaker, and plenty of people prefer to keep to themselves. Hell, not being too \ncomfortable around people is a damn fine reason to go to sea. This was \ndifferent, though. \nIt wasn’t just that they didn’t talk much, they seemed uncomfortable with me. \nThey’d avoid eye contact, and only barely acknowledge me if we were on a \nshift together.
