Then he made a, he made a noise, \njust… just a really horrible sound. I think he was trying to cry. \n \nThe paramedics took him after that. They didn’t really want to, but it was \nclearly more in their domain than ours. I assume hospitals probably have their \nown version of a Section 31 those poor idiots had to sign later. Daisy and I told \nthem we’d clear it up on the police side. Just a standard suicide, and the body \nwas taken by the ambulance. It cut down on the forms, and neither of us \nwanted to sign another goddamn Section 31. \n \nARCHIVIST \nFascinating. What other cases have fallen under this classification? \n \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG043 – Section 31 \n10 \n \nBASIRA \nOfficially, I’ve only had one other, and that was yours. ARCHIVIST \nOfficially? \n \nBASIRA \nYou get a few dozen calls a year from people who have strange experiences, \nbut they don’t have any evidence. I mean, if what they say is true, then it \nwould be a Section 31, but… there’s nothing that can be investigated or \nproven, so there’s nothing to report. I always feel bad for them; they’re always \nso sincere, so sure you can help, but unless they can point to the ghost or the \nspooky clown doll or whatever, there’s not really a lot we can do. \n \nI’ve also been quite lucky, to be honest. I’ve dodged quite a few of the nastier \nSection 31s over the years. I remember Harry used to get wasted and tell all \nsorts of grim stories. \n \nARCHIVIST \nAh, full names, please. \n \nBASIRA \nSorry, Sergeant Harry Altman. Worked with him a few years back, before he \nretired. \n \nARCHIVIST \nRight. So… just to return to, er, Gertrude’s body. That’s currently considered a \npara— a weird case? \n \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG043 – Section 31 \n11 \n \nBASIRA \nI mean, we’re investigating it as a murder because that’s what it is, but you \nguys are basically an automatic Section 31, so I’ve got almost no help on it. \nMaybe that’s why I wanted to make a statement, you know? I can’t talk to \nanybody about this stuff, and then I come here, and you’ve got all this… all \nthese people’s experiences listened to and filed away. It’s... I don’t know. I’ve \nbeen meaning to come in ever since that callout. \nARCHIVIST \nMm. Yes. S-So um… so no-one is helping you with Gertrude’s case? No \noversight? \n \nBASIRA \nNot really. I tried making the argument that the murder didn’t seem to connect \nto any of your ‘paranormal business’, at least not directly, but nope. I’ve got a \nshot corpse, three boxes of cassettes, and Daisy, who’s CID now, which I \nsuppose means it’s technically her problem, but she’s now the only detective \nwho’s already sectioned so she’s always way too busy. As far as I know, neither \nof us have even had a chance to actually start listening to the tapes. \n \nARCHIVIST \nInteresting.
