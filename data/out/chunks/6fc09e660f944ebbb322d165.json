There were a couple of \nspiders, so I changed routes and found, I think it’s a gas main. Must be for the \nwhole building. But there’s someone coming and I- I don’t know who else \nwould be down here, except... I mean, whatever’s down here. It was… it was \njust checking on the upper levels, I didn’t prepare for- \nNOT!SASHA \nJon? \n(The Archivist makes a startled noise.) \nJon is that you? \nARCHIVIST \nOh, Sasha, thank god. I thought you- I thought you were a... I don’t know. What \nare you doing down here? \nNOT!SASHA \nForgot my coat. I noticed the trap door was open and wanted to make sure \nyou were ok. Did Elias give you the key? \n\nARCHIVIST \nYes, he… he thought it might help put a stop to some of my “wilder \nimaginings”. Are you ok? \nNOT!SASHA \nYes, I’m ok...

I think I need \nsome fresh air. \nEnd supplemental. \n[The Magnus Archives Theme - Outro] \nThe Magnus Archives is a podcast distributed by Rusty Quill and licensed under \na creative commons attribution, non-commercial share alike 4.0 international \nlicense.
