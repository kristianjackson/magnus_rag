He’s... ascended, become a part of The Eye. He’s… he’s \nbeyond us. \nMARTIN \n(Loudly to Jonah) Just shut up! Christ! \nARCHIVIST \nHe can’t hear you. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 193 – A Stern Look \n \n4 \nMARTIN \nSo, so what? He’s not aware of us? Of, of any of this? \nARCHIVIST \nNo. Or if he is, it’s only as a miniscule speck amongst the flood of knowledge \nand fear that’s passing through him. He is become the conduit between this \nnew world and the thing that watches it. It’s all running through him. \nMARTIN \nSounds awful. \nARCHIVIST \nTo someone so close to it, I imagine it would be a state of… agonised bliss. \nI can feel it... the... completeness of it all passing out from him. I can see \neverything from here, and that’s still just a hint of what he must be feeling— \n \nMARTIN \n(Warning) John... \nARCHIVIST \n—as he watches a man run screaming down endless dark alleys that close and \ncrush and press— \nMARTIN \n(Hard warning) John… \nStay with me. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 193 – A Stern Look \n \n5 \nARCHIVIST \nSorry. I-It’s a, it’s a lot. \nMARTIN \nI, I can see that but you need to keep it together. \nARCHIVIST \nS-sorry, I think… I can handle it. \nMARTIN \nRight, so what’s the play? \n(Beat) \n(Jonah is speaking “what have you done what have you done”) \nARCHIVIST \nI-I’m not sure. \nMARTIN \nWell… we came here to confront Elias—Gah! Jonah— whatever! So, how do \nwe do that? \nARCHIVIST \nHe’s too far gone. He’s barely even aware we exist. \nMARTIN \nAnd I’m guessing you can’t just destroy him like the others? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 193 – A Stern Look \n \n6 \nARCHIVIST \nNo. God knows what would happen if I called upon The Eye to try and destroy \na vital piece of itself. Best case scenario, nothing happens. \nMARTIN \nAnd worst case? \nARCHIVIST \nNo idea. An enormous explosion that destroys the world? We get torn apart, \nbut still suffering or, or cast off to the edges of the fearscape, maybe? I, I don’t \nknow. \nMARTIN \nOkay. So not that then. But… what about something, like, physical? \nARCHIVIST \nI— What? \nMARTIN \nUh, look, I know it’s all about dream logic and metaphor and all that… stuff, \nbut, y’know, what if we just… what if we just grabbed him and, y’know, pulled \nhim down? Or, or just threw something heavy at him? \nARCHIVIST \nUh... I, I don’t… \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 193 – A Stern Look \n \n7 \nMARTIN \nOr, or, or, what about, um… Th-that’s Elias’ body, right? I mean, yeah, they’re \nobviously Magnus’ eyes, but that’s still a Bouchard body up there so... so \nmaybe Magnus’ original body is just still lying around here somewhere? That, \nthat was a weakness before the transformation, so… maybe we could still use \nthat? \nARCHIVIST \nIt’s gone. Ashes swept away by the winds of ecstatic terror. What you see up \nthere is all that remains. \nMARTIN \nRight. \n(Sighing) (softly) Right, right, right. \n…Is the original Elias still in there somewhere? \nARCHIVIST \nHe’s, uh, I— \nMARTIN \nMaybe we could get through to him somehow? \nARCHIVIST \nAh, no, it isn’t that— Ahh… \n[Ceaseless chanting ceases; a whirl of wind with paper noises and \ntwo feet landing]", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 1, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 3625}}
