I don't find them funny, either. Just a \nbit baffling, really. I've never understood why people would find grown men in \nstupid make-up and wigs funny. Or scary. It's the same with the dolls. People \ntalk about their cold dead eyes, but they don't seem to have any problem with \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG024 – Strange Music \n2 \n \nstatues. I suppose now I've got good reason to be scared of both. I just want \nyou to understand, I wasn't seeing things out of fear. This happened. \nIt didn't come as a surprise when my grandfather died last August. I'd been \nliving with him for almost two years at his home in Bootle, looking after him \nthrough his illness. My mother was having her own difficulties at the time and \nmy good-for-nothing father wanted nothing to do with any of it, so looking \nafter my grandpa came down to me. It wasn't so bad, really. My grandpa was a \nstrange man at times. He'd been a carnie for most of his life, working with \ntravelling circuses and freak shows all over Europe, and was something of a \nrecluse in his later years. He could also swear a blue streak a mile wide. Get \nhim behind the keys of a piano, though, and I don't know anyone who could \nplay as beautifully as he could. Like I say, it wasn't a surprise when he finally \ndied, but I still found it difficult. As you may have guessed, I don't have a great \nrelationship with my parents and have always had some problems making \nfriends, so… when he went it hit me hard. \nI didn't go out that week. Or the next. I saw Joshua, my... partner, I suppose \nyou'd have called him, but aside from that, I didn't see anybody between \ngrandpa's death and the funeral. It was just me, Josh and my mother. Grandpa \nhad never been a churchgoer, but my mother had a lot of faith, so paid for a \nMethodist funeral, such as it was. It was a hot, muggy day, and I remember \nwondering whether the stinging in my eyes was from the tears or the sweat. As \nit turned out, grandpa had left me his house. It didn't really sink in for a while – \nthe house had been the most home I'd had for so long that I'd always felt it \nwas mine in some ways. \nGoing through my grandpa's old papers and possessions was harder than I had \nexpected. It was only reading some of his own letters that I discovered his birth", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 0, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 3122}}
