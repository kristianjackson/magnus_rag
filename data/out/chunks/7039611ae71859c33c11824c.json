It was jerky and \nunsteady, and he didn’t seem to notice that he was doing it. \nI had no idea what was going on, not really, but I was somehow desperate to \nget that book back. He was much bigger than me, though, so all I could do was \nfollow as he walked down alleys and side streets. There were fewer and fewer \npeople about, and I realised with a start that I had failed to notice nightfall. At \nthe far end of a quiet residential road, he walked up to one of the houses. I \nnever found it again, and for all I knew it might have actually been his house. \nHe was still reading. When he reached the entrance, he held up the book and \nplaced it on the front door. I saw that cut-away panel of Mr. Spider’s stained \nand bloody right-hand door. And he knocked on it twice. I saw the words \nclearly in my mind almost more than I heard the sound: ‘KNOCK KNOCK’. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG081 – A Guest for Mr Spider \n10 \n \nThe door opened, and inside was dark. Against that darkness I could see the \nthin grey strands wrapped around the limbs of my former bully. And then, \nfrom inside, stretched two impossibly long limbs, bony and covered in coarse, \nblack hair. For a second, there was almost the start of a scream, but the legs \nwrapped around him too quickly, and he disappeared into the doorway and \nout of sight. It slammed behind him, and he was gone, taking the book with \nhim. \nARCHIVIST \nStatement ends. \nYou can see, I hope, why this engendered in me something of a fascination \nwith the supernatural, and some deep feelings regarding the name ‘Jurgen \nLeitner’. I cannot corroborate this story in any real form for obvious reasons. \nMy grandmother peacefully passed away five years ago and there is no-one \nelse who would have records of anything other than the general context. If I \nwere assessing this as someone else’s statement, I would have dismissed it out \nof hand, and don’t think that doesn’t eat at me. But it is so vivid in my mind. \nThe spider’s legs reaching from that tiny door. The first of the dark powers to \ntouch me, perhaps, but it did not claim me. \nSpeaking this out loud for the first time, I am struck by something else. The \nfeeling I have been living with my whole life, that if that poor idiot hadn’t \ngotten involved he would still be alive. A strange conviction that, if I had been \nable to face that thing myself, maybe I could have saved him. \nStopped it. Ridiculous, of course, I was eight, but it has made me reconsider my \nattitude to getting help. I have consistently kept the others at arm’s length, \ntried to deal with things myself and it… it hasn’t gone well. Whatever is going \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG081 – A Guest for Mr Spider \n11 \n \non, this ‘Unknowing’ that S– Not! Sasha was talking about, Elias killing \nGertrude and maybe Leitner as well… I need help. I need allies. I just wish this \nrevelation didn’t come just as everyone is convinced I’m a deranged killer. \n[There’s the sound of a front door unlocking and someone entering the \nroom.] \nARCHIVIST \nOh, um… hello! \nGEORGIE \nEverything okay, John? \n[Georgie closes the door.] \nARCHIVIST \nEr, yeah. Just recording some thoughts. Didn’t… I didn’t know when you were \ngoing to be home. \nGEORGIE \nSure. (Pause) Did you… clean the kitchen? \nARCHIVIST \nEr, a bit. I, I mean, I can’t exactly pay you anything; I thought… \nGEORGIE \nIt’s fine. To be honest, it’s nice to have someone keep the Admiral company \nwhile I’m out. \nARCHIVIST \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG081 – A Guest for Mr Spider \n12 \n \nHe literally just sleeps on the radiator. I… I’ve got a lot of time to kill. \nGEORGIE \nYou… looking for a new job yet? \nARCHIVIST \nIt’s complicated, there’s… there’s a lot of stuff hanging over from the last one \nI’ve got to take care of. \nGEORGIE \nWell, like I said, you’re welcome here as long as you need. \nARCHIVIST \nI suppose you are rolling in all that sock money. \nGEORGIE \nUrgh. \nARCHIVIST \nUp to your eyeballs in mattresses. \nGEORGIE \nDon’t. They did send me one, you know. Oh, it was dreadful. I couldn’t sleep on \nit. I managed three days before my back gave out. I’ve still got it somewhere in \nthe guest room, if the other one’s not up to your exacting standards. \nARCHIVIST \nOoh… I think I’m alright.
