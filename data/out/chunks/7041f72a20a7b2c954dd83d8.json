By carefully reading \nspecific passages in certain locations, I am able to exercise… a degree of \ncontrol over the substance of the tunnels. \nARCHIVIST \nI didn’t hear you say anything down there. \nLEITNER \nI said reading. It doesn’t need to be spoken aloud. \nARCHIVIST \nRight. So you can change the tunnels? \nLEITNER \nI can. Though even setting aside the obvious dangers, it’s a time-consuming \nand imprecise process. That said, I will admit that when you began to explore \nagain, I… closed off certain passages, and remade others. I, I wanted to keep \nyou contained while deciding whether to make contact. \nARCHIVIST \nYou moved the tunnels for me? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG080 – The Librarian \nLEITNER \nThe upper levels, yes. Made them more rational, actually. It didn’t strike you as \nodd that you were able to map them in a matter of weeks? \nARCHIVIST \nI thought I was just getting a sense of the place. I suppose you left the rubbish \naround for me as well, giving me hints? And the arrow? \nLEITNER \nNo. I thought I was being very careful cleaning up after myself, but you have \nkeener eyes than I gave you credit for. I should have expected that, I suppose. \nThe arrow, however, was not mine. The ‘Not-Sasha’ had come down several \ntimes. I suspect it was almost as curious about me as you were. \nPerhaps it thought you might have better luck flushing me out. I suppose, in a \nway, it was right. In retrospect, using The Seven Lamps so much was perhaps \nunwise. It is possible I unbalanced Smirke’s architecture somewhat, however \ncautious I might have tried to be. \nARCHIVIST \nAnd the other book? \nLEITNER \nHardly a book. Barely twelve pages. It is entitled A Disappearance. If read cover \nto cover, it removes one from the world. I cannot say precisely what that \nmeans, only that the assistant I assigned to it, Jacob Feng, was never seen \nagain. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG080 – The Librarian \nI have found, however, that reading only one or two words is sufficient to hide \nme from the prying eyes of your master. It allowed me to talk with Gertrude in \nrelative safety, and occasionally come above ground for my own ends. \nARCHIVIST \nMy master? We’ll get to that. How long have you been down there? \nLEITNER \nHard to say. I’ve been in hiding for over twenty years now, ever since my \nlibrary was destroyed. \nObviously I have not spent all that time below your Institute. The old Millbank \nprison tunnels stretch out a very long way, and there are other entrances than \nthe one below the Archives. I have a small number of… secure locations, \nthough since Gertrude’s death I have been reluctant to leave the tunnels. I \ndislike spending too much time in the open. \nI am always being hunted. Both by creatures like the ones you have \nencountered, and by certain human individuals who believe I am to blame for \nthe books that destroyed their loved ones. Three years ago, I made the mistake \nof spending a full night outside my safehouses. I was almost beaten to death \nby an angry goth. \nARCHIVIST \n(Laughs) That’ll be our Gerard. \nLEITNER \nI don’t follow. \nARCHIVIST \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG080 – The Librarian \nI wouldn’t worry about him. He passed away a couple of years ago. \nLEITNER \nThat is hardly my point. \nARCHIVIST \nSo are you to blame? \nLEITNER \nFor what? \nARCHIVIST \nFor the books. Or did you just stick your name on them by accident? Why the \n“Library of Jurgen Leitner”? \nLEITNER \nI… thought that I could control them; that I alone had the knowledge to \ncontain them. Back then, I believed they were simply books. Horrifying, \npowerful, yes, but with rules, limits that could be charted. I was a fool. I had no \nidea what forces lay behind them, or that they had other servants that might \ncome searching. \nI was ruthless, I will admit that. I don’t know how many assistants I sacrificed \nto learn the secrets of the volumes I collected. Dozens, at least. Only a few \nescaped with their life and mind intact, and even then they were deeply \nmarked. But I was relentless. I saw myself as a guardian, a reverse Pandora, \ngathering the evils of the world and locking them away.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 1, "chunk_count": 9, "chars": 4153}}
