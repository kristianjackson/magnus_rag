It’s just nice to see you like this. \n[Tape clicks off] \n[Tape clicks on] \n[Bird song, much closer and clearer] \n[The distant sound of music] \nMARTIN \nSo what now? I don’t see a doorbell. \nARCHIVIST \nI’m not even sure this door actually opens. \nMARTIN \nBut it should, it’s the front door! Besides, it’s the biggest one so if it’s not— \nARCHIVIST \nI mean maybe they expect you to come in through the café or, I mean, they \nusually have a little gift shop or something. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 180 – Moving On \n21 \nMARTIN \nOkay, so where would they be? \nARCHIVIST \nNo idea. (chuckling) \nMARTIN \nI thought you said you’d been here before. \nARCHIVIST \nI said I might have been, and even if I have, I was twelve. \nMARTIN \nI’ll tell you what, it is more convenient when you know everything. \n[Sounds of a keys and a large door unlocking] \nARCHIVIST \n(Pleased) Oh! Guess I was wrong. \nMARTIN \nGet ready. \nARCHIVIST \nTo do what? \nMARTIN \nWhat do you mean “What”? Smite them. If we need to. \nWait, hang on, can you even smite people here? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 180 – Moving On \n22 \nARCHIVIST \nI-I don’t think so. \n[Door opens, piano music can be heard playing] \nMARTIN \nOh. Oh no… ah... \n[Footstep] \nANNABELLE \nGood morning. \nMARTIN \n…Uh… Yes. \nANNABELLE \nCome on in. He’s waiting for you. \nARCHIVIST \nOh. And who exactly— \nMARTIN \nJ-J-John… John… \nARCHIVIST \nWhat? \nMARTIN \nI think… um… Annabelle? Annabelle Cane? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 180 – Moving On \n23 \nANNABELLE \nCome on. He’s very excited, you know. \n[Keys rattle and footsteps as she moves back into the house] \nMARTIN \nSo, do we follow or...? \nARCHIVIST \nI... I suppose. \n[They follow; the door creaks as they open it further, and there is a \nquick glitching-static sound as they pass the threshold] \n(Mild discomfort noises from Martin and the Archivist) \n[Annabelle closes and locks the door] \nARCHIVIST \nSo… Annabelle, what are you playing at? What are you doing here? \nANNABELLE \nI really wouldn’t worry about that. I’m just helping out around the place a little \nbit. Making myself at home. You know how it is. \n[Their footsteps echo on wooden floors as they follow her through \nthe house; the piano music slowly gets louder] \nMARTIN \nJohn, I don’t like this. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 180 – Moving On \n24 \nANNABELLE \nYou can relax, Mr Blackwood. You’re safe here. \nMARTIN \nI don’t feel it. \nANNABELLE \nNot something I can help, I’m afraid. \nMARTIN \nThough... oh John, do you feel, huh, do you feel hungry? \nARCHIVIST \nI, um... Actually, I was going to say I’m feeling... really tired. \nANNABELLE \nNot surprising. When’s the last time you slept? \n(Martin yawns) \nARCHIVIST \nI don’t know. I mean weeks ago. Months maybe. \nANNABELLE \nWell there you go, then. \nJust in here. \n[Annabelle opens the door; the piano music becomes clear and \nclose; there is a ticking antique clock sometimes audible] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 180 – Moving On \n25 \nANNABELLE (CONT’D) \nYour guests are here, Mikaele. \n[Piano playing pauses] \nMIKAELE \nHoo-hoo-hoo! Excellent! Come in, come in! Ah, a pleasure to meet both of you. \nThank you Annabelle. \nANNABELLE \nYou’re quite welcome. \n[Piano playing resumes] \nANNABELLE (CONT’D) \nHave fun. \nARCHIVIST \n(Extremely tired) Sorry, Mikaele... Salesa? \nMIKAELE \nThe one and only. I must say I’ve been, uh... \n[The Archivist and Martin collapse with a small sigh, fast asleep] \n[Piano playing stops] \n(Disappointed umm from Mikaela) \n(Beat)", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 5, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 3666}}
