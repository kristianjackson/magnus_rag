By the time I got back to Elandsstraat it was starting to get dark \nand I was feeling quite stressed, so I decided to pop into one of the cafés to \nrelax before joining up with my friends. \nI couldn’t say for sure exactly how long I was in there, but I do know it had \ngotten fully dark by the time I noticed I wasn’t sat at my table alone. I’ve tried \nto describe the man who now sat opposite me many times, but it’s difficult. He \nwas short, very short, and felt like he had an odd density to him. His hair was \nbrownish, I think, cut quite short, and he was clean shaven. His face and dress \nwas utterly unremarkable, and the more I try to think of exactly what he \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG002 – Do Not Open \n3 \n \nlooked like, the harder it is to picture him clearly. To be honest, though, I’m \ninclined to blame that on the drugs. \nThe man introduced himself as John, and asked how I was. I replied as best I \ncould, and he nodded, saying he also was an Englishman inside a foreign land. I \nremember he used that exact phrase because it struck me at the time as very \nodd. He said he was from Liverpool, though I don’t recall him having any sort of \naccent, and that he was looking for a friend who he could rely on for a favour. \nNow, high as I was, I got suspicious as soon as he said that last part and I \nstarted to shake my head. John said it was nothing too onerous, just looking \nafter a package for him until he had some friends pick it up, and that he would \npay well. I thought he was talking about smuggling, and was about to refuse \nagain when he reached into his… jacket, I think? and pulled out an envelope. \nInside was £10,000. I know; I counted it. I knew it was a stupid move but I kept \nremembering my friend Richard telling me how easy it had been to get a \npound of hash through customs on his first trip to Holland, and holding that \nmuch cash in my hands… I said yes. John smiled, thanked me, and said that he \nwould be in touch. He left the coffee shop and I immediately started panicking \nabout what I had agreed to. I wanted to chase after him and return the money, \nbut something weighed me down, kept me locked into my seat. I just sat there \nfor a long time. \nI don’t remember much about the next few days except worrying about when \nI’d see John again. I was careful not to spend any of the money he’d given me, \nand had decided to return it as soon as he turned up. I’d say I had made a \nmistake and couldn’t take his money or look after anything from him. I tried to \nenjoy myself, but it was like this shadow hanging over me, and I couldn’t stop \nthinking about it. I waited for days, right up until the end of our trip, but he \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG002 – Do Not Open \n4 \n \nnever showed up. I obsessively checked my suitcase before boarding the plane \nhome, just in case someone had snuck something into it, but there was nothing \nnew in there. \nI flew back to England with my friends still high and £10,000 tucked into my \ncoat pocket. It was surreal. It wasn’t until almost a year later that I felt \nconfident enough to actually spend any of the money. I’d moved down to work \nfor a small architects’ firm in Bournemouth on the south coast. It was an entry \nlevel job and the pay wasn’t great, but it was the only offer I got in my chosen \nfield, so I moved down there with the hopes of getting some experience and a \nbetter position in a year or two. \nBournemouth was a decent-size seaside town, though much less idyllic than I’d \nassumed it would have been, but rents for a place on my own were a little bit \nout of my price range, given my starting pay grade. I didn’t know anyone else \ndown there, and wasn’t keen to share my space with strangers, so I decided to \nuse some of the money I’d been given in Amsterdam the previous year. I \nreasoned they were unlikely to find me at this stage – I’d not given John any of \nmy details when he spoke to me, not even my name, and if they hadn’t been \nable to find me over the course of the last year, it was doubtful they’d be able \nto track me here. Also, if it had been drug smuggling, as I suspected, £10,000 \nprobably wasn’t so much money to them that they’d track me this far over it. \nAlso, and looking back this sounds stupid, but I’d just grown a beard and \nthought it would be hard for anyone to recognise me as the same guy. So I \nspent a bit of John’s money on renting a nice one-bedroom flat in the Triangle, \nnear the town centre, and moved in almost immediately.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 1, "chunk_count": 9, "chars": 4500}}
