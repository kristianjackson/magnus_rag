I called out to Pete, making sure \nhe was still nearby as I fumbled in the locker for my torch. I finally found it and \nturned it on. The beam was so bright in the oppressive darkness that I had to \nblink away tears. Using the light from mine, Pete found his own flashlight and \ntogether we headed out into the CSC. We checked each cell in turn, lying to \nthe prisoners inside about when the power would be back and sending them \nback to their beds with threats of violence. I didn’t see any of the other \nwarders around and was starting to get really nervous. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG052 – Exceptional Risk \n15 \n \nAnd when we had checked all the other cells, we went towards Robert \nMontauk’s. The torch beams shot out in front of us, but as they fell upon the \ndoor to his cell, something was wrong. I wasn’t quite sure what I was looking at \nfor a second and then I realised that his cell door was open, but the torchlight \nwasn’t reaching the inside. As it hit the threshold, it just stopped, a clear and \ndistinct line of darkness, beyond which nothing could be seen. From inside \nthere came the wet sound of tearing and a low moan of pain. \nI wanted to run, but instead I took a step forward. And my torch died. Pete’s \nwent off as well and we just stood there, terrified, unable to see a thing. The \nsounds were no longer coming from inside the cell and that didn’t reassure me \nas much as it might have. About 15 feet behind me, I heard Pete fumbling \naround, calling out my name. I was about to reply, tell him to stay where he \nwas, when I heard something that froze my blood. Pete said, \"There you are.\" \nHe was not touching me. \nAlmost immediately, there was a growl from the darkness. It was throaty and \nraw, but at the same time sounded almost musical. Pete screamed and I heard \nhim fall to the floor. It was at that moment that the lights came back on. We \nwere alone. I ran to do a quick circuit of the CSC, as the other prison officers \narrived, but there was no one else there. Apparently, there’d been some \nproblems with the doors and they hadn’t been able to get to the main ERU \ncells. Pete was still on the ground when I returned, though he seemed \nphysically unharmed. It was one of the other warders that found what was left \nof Robert Montauk. \nI took the fall for it. They didn’t try to make out like I had killed him, just that it \nhad happened on my watch and due to my negligence. They’d been trying to \npush me out ever since the prison inspectorate had written the CSC up for \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG052 – Exceptional Risk \n16 \n \nexcessive use of force the year before. They really threw the book at me: gross \nincompetence. It’s a bitter phrase to say out loud. What was I supposed to tell \nthem? A monster made of darkness murdered him? Pete was no help. He \nhanded in his notice two hours after the lights came back on. I didn’t even get \na chance to speak to him, ask what had happened. He was just gone. I don’t \nreally have anything more to say about it. It was a clearly paranormal incident \nthat led to the end of my career. And it’s not fair. \nStatement ends. \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nPrison records are very hard to acquire for the Close Supervision Centres. Due \nto the small number of inmates held there, most information could be \nconsidered ‘identifying’, so the prison service tends to hide behind data \nprotection laws when asked about them. Beyond that, many of the prison \nrecords from before the mid-2000s have still not been digitised, making follow-\nup on this hard. \nTim hit something of a dead end trying to look up Peter Gordo, though Sasha \ndid manage to track down the 2002 visitor logs for the whole of Wakefield \nprison. It took some searching, but I managed to find what I believe to be the \nentry for the visit from Mr Brown’s mysterious old man. The name given is \nMaxwell Rayner. \nMartin hasn’t had much luck tracking down Mr Brown himself. According to \nCaroline Brodie, his ex-wife, she left him in 2004 after his dismissal from the \nprison service pushed him further into alcoholism and he became abusive.
