The ladder ends. \nMARTIN \nWhat do you mean it ends? \nBASIRA \nI’m guessing you’re not talking about the ground. \nARCHIVIST \nNo. No ground. And... no more ladder. \nMARTIN \nSo what do we do? \nBASIRA \nWhat do you think? We jump. And we fall. \n(Martin chuckles in disbelief) \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 198 – Precipice \n14 \nMARTIN \nWh-wh-what?! No! No, no. I’m not, I’m not doing that. This is, this is obviously \nlike, like a wrong turn or something. \nBASIRA \nIt’s a ladder, Martin. \nMARTIN \nYeah, I know Basira, but somehow we’ve still managed it! \nBASIRA \nYou said it won’t kill us, right? \nARCHIVIST \nRight.
