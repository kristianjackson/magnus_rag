It’s not something all that special really, \nevery diocese should have a trained exorcist available, or failing that a bishop \ncan do it, but nine times out of ten the duties of an exorcist are to recommend \na good psychiatrist, doctor or substance abuse program, and bishops don’t \nusually have time for that. I was an exorcist for the Diocese of Oxford when \nthis all happened. I trained as a Jesuit, so I was used to moving about a lot, but \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG019 – Confession \n3 \n \nI was at Oxford from about 2005 right through to my arrest in 2009. There \nwere two exorcists in the diocese, myself and an old Augustinian by the name \nof Father Harrogate. I would ask as a favour that you not follow up with him; \nhe plays no part in what happened to me and would, I think, be upset by any \nreminder of my actions. \nIn my time I have performed just over one hundred exorcisms, with varying \ndegrees of success. It was relatively rare that it felt like much more than a \nblessing or a prayer. It still helped in most cases, but as one of the most \ncommon types of possession is not The Exorcist-style of speaking in a demonic \ntongue and floating off the bed, but rather that of an unnatural depression, it \nwas often hard to be sure. It is difficult to say how many were devout believers \nwho came to us with a very natural depression, and simply preferred to look to \nthe Church than to counselling or medicine. Even those were helped to some \ndegree, I believe, even if only as a placebo. On a few occasions, though I did \nencounter things that served to firm up my belief in the Devil and my faith in \nmy Lo– my L– I’m sorry, It won’t let me say the words. It won’t let me pray \neither, but I hope I will not be judged too harshly for it on the final day. \nAs I was saying, there were times when I felt things pushing back. I was once \ncursed at in Sumerian by a young man who was utterly illiterate, and had the \nnames of my childhood pets thrown at me by an old Jamaican man. I will admit \nthat there were times that I have been very afraid of what I was trying to \nremove, but I always had faith in Je– I always had faith. None of it prepared me \nfor what happened on Bullingdon Road, though. That was something else \nentirely. \nI was doing some work at the Catholic chaplaincy in St Aldate’s, generally \ntrying to help the spiritual well-being of the students who came to us, when \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG019 – Confession \n4 \n \nFather Singh, one of the other priests working there, came to me. He said he \nhad a student from St Hughes asking after an exorcism, and wanted to refer \nher to me. I told him of course and he set up a meeting between us. The \nstudent’s name was Bethany O’Connor, and much of what she told me was \nunder the seal of confession, something I will not break even now, so suffice it \nto say she believed that she was no longer in control of her own mind. \nEven as we talked, she spent much of her time looking around or staring into \nmy eyes with what I can only describe as pointed suspicion. Bethany told me \nthat her will was still her own but she could no longer trust her senses, and had \nfound herself doing much that she did not understand. \nI remember one moment very clearly, in our second meeting I believe. We \nwere taking a walk around the botanical gardens, as she said it calmed her \nwhen talking of her problem. She reached into her bag, took out what \nappeared to be a small slab of stone, slate, I think, and started to lift it to her \nmouth as if to eat it. I asked her what she was doing, and she stopped, looked \nat the rock she held in her hand, and threw it away before bursting into tears. \nShe told me that it felt like something was in her head, changing what she saw \nand felt and thought. I asked when this had started, and she told me it was \nafter she had moved out of her college halls and into a house on Bullingdon \nRoad with her friends. I suggested that perhaps it had something to do with \nthe stresses of entering second year, but she insisted it was something to do \nwith the house. Finally, after several discussions, I agreed to look over the \nhouse and perform a small blessing in case there was anything wrong with the \nplace, spiritually speaking. \nIt was", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 1, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 4499}}
