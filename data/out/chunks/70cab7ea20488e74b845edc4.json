The ground was disturbed as though by a \nstruggle, and I suddenly realised what had happened. Ross had returned by \nnow, shaking and pale but just as quiet as I was, and together we followed a \ntrail of bitten-off fingers like breadcrumbs taking us home. \n‘Home’ in this case was the lawn just outside the cottage of Angus Stewart, an \nacre or so of land he kept clear for meetings, parties or whatever other events \nthe tiny community might find they needed space for. Yesterday it had been \nthe parking of a small, sky blue transit van. I recognised it, of course: it \nbelonged to a young lady from Inverness, I never got her name, who ran a \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 125 – Civilian Casualties \n \n7 \n \nsmall, mobile lending library that travelled around the villages and crofts of the \nHighlands. \nNow she lay at the centre of absolute carnage. Eventually, it would be \nconclusively established that all sixteen other residents of Lanncraig were \nthere, though to simply look at the scene it was impossible to tell mud from \nblood from flesh from bone, and I thank God every day that not one resident \nof that poor doomed place had children. The head of Angus Stewart leered up \nat me from the ground, lips parted in that same expression of fury and joy, \ncheeks latticed with steel sheep wire. \nA sudden thought struck me, that since our struggle on arriving with Callum \nMcKenzie, neither myself nor Constable Ross had made any noise at all. If \nthere were survivors, they had no way to know it was safe. Abruptly, I shouted, \ncalling for anyone who might still be alive, telling them they could come out. I \ntried to ignore the edge of panic in my voice, but my only answer was the \nmocking bleating of sheep and those impossibly distant pipes. \nRoss glared at me, clearly startled by my shouting, and stepped gingerly \nthrough the dirt and viscera towards the centre. Neither of us could pretend \nwe cared about preserving evidence at this point. These people, good people, \nhad slaughtered each other for no reason at all, and there was nothing we \ncould do to change that fact. \nI don’t know exactly how the woman who ran the library van died. At a certain \npoint, the injuries all seemed to bleed together, if you’ll excuse the expression. \nAll I could see for certain was that she held a book in her hands. It was a \npaperback, old and unloved, with obvious signs of wear long before it found \nitself in this chaos. The cover and title were unrecognisable, now far too \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 125 – Civilian Casualties \n \n8 \n \nsoaked in blood, but it was clear that at some point the woman holding it had \ntorn it clean in two down the spine, and now held half in each of what was left \nof her hands. Ross told me later that she’d gotten a good look at the pages, \nand that every single one of them was blank. \nThat was when our back-up arrived. It looked like whatever strangeness had \naffected the radio had been only on our side, and my frantic messages had \nreached the station loud and clear. It was a whole mess for a long time. You \nmight have read about it in a few of the papers; I think the official report \ncovered it as a drunken brawl that got out of hand. It wasn’t, obviously, and \nno-one who was actually there signed the report, but almost everyone who \nactually dealt with the scene got signed off for several weeks with stress, so \ndidn’t get to have much say in the matter. There didn’t really need to be any \nproper cover-up. It was an isolated place and the folk who had still been living \nthere were on the older side, with little real connection to the outside world. I \nguess the media doesn’t really care about crofters, especially once the police \nhad swept up the more gory details. \nI moved back to Macclesfield shortly afterwards. It pretty much ended my \nmarriage, since my wife is why I moved up to Inverness in the first place, but I \njust couldn’t go on up there. I can’t stand the sound of bagpipes. And \nsometimes, at night, I still hear sheep in the distance. \nARCHIVIST \nStatement ends. \nHm, an Englishman returning from Scotland with a fear of bagpipes and sheep. \nI’m sure we can all relate.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 3, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 4231}}
