He turns to see the \nfamiliar screen, the familiar woman beneath it. She looks up at him with an \nexpression of recognition and weary dread. She types and types and types, her \nfingers a blur flying across the keyboard and yet never fast enough to outrun \nthe relentless words that flow like dark water across the screen that stretches \noff into the sky: IT HURTS. She is shaking her head, defiant in her well-worn \nterror, and tries with every corner of her will to force back the rolling tide of \nwords: IT HURTS. Her fingers are still; her hands raise to her mind, trying to \nthink, trying to comprehend: IT HURTS. \n \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG120 – Eye Contact \n \n3 \n \nShe turns to stare at the Archivist. There is hatred in her eyes, and blame, an \naching certainty that she is here because of him. He has brought her here. He \nwatches as she slowly brings the keyboard up to her lips, fighting against it \nevery moment. She bites down, shards of plastic cutting her fingers, as the \nwords scroll unfettered across the screen for miles and miles and miles and \nmiles. And she is gone. \n \nThe Archivist wanders. He is searching, though for what he does not know. He \npasses those places he can no longer watch: the silent wards of peeling skin; \nthe empty warehouse of thick darkness and frightened children; the rusted \ntrain car that smells of eager, infectious hate. All through it the shadow is \nabove him, the shape that gazes down upon him, bloodshot and unblinking. \n \nThe rain is still there, though it is empty. The long and desolate road, slick with \nthe downpour, a police car’s lights flashing over the unmoving van. The doors \nare open and the two familiar statues stand either side of the well-worn \nwooden box. He looks around, his eyes scanning this forever road and the \nclouds of iron grey, looking for her, but she is not there. The Archivist expects, \nhe hopes, to find the violence in her looking back at him, hungry for pursuit \nand murder, but the emptiness of the place is complete, the only sounds the \ngentle singing of the box and the pounding, bitter rain. He knows the writing \non the coffin has changed, though it is still carved deep into the splintered \nwood: I AM FOR YOU. He knows it is not addressed to him, but he reaches \ndown and pulls the chains off all the same. It opens and he walks slowly down \nthe steps into the earth, but even as it closes above him, the great shadow still \nsees him. There is nowhere in this universe that it would not blot out the sky. \n \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG120 – Eye Contact \n \n4 \n \nThe rough-hewn tunnels go down, down beyond anything but sodden earth \nand despair, until the Archivist arrives at the tunnels. Here he sees the train, \ntwisted and pressed in on all sides, nothing but shrieking metal and cracked \nglass. He climbs inside and takes his seat, mouth tasting of mud and soil, his \neyes moving through the dust and grit unblinking. The passenger is there, \nthough she is, as always, stationary. Dry dirt trickles between her teeth as she \nsmiles mirthlessly, seeing the Archivist has returned. She is relaxed, suspended \nfrom a dozen broken handrails and shattered, jagged seats. They cut her flesh, \nbut she does not bleed. There is no pain in her eyes. There is nothing except \nthe certainty of her fate. \n \nThe train begins to move, the wheels screaming with the awful weight of it, \nevery part buckling and pressing in, but the Archivist is not afraid. His only fear \nis that even here at the centre of the world, barrelling towards a lightless, \ninfinite tomb, still he will be watched. Still he will watch. The expression on the \npassenger’s face does not change, even as the contorting metal crushes her \nskull like an egg and she vanishes from view. He catches a glimpse of an advert \nabove his seat: DIG. \n \nThere is a door in front of him, a yellow door. He knows the dream it used to \nlead to. He knows it well. But that’s not where it leads any more. He does not \nknow what is behind it anymore, and he is deathly afraid of finding out. The \nArchivist turns away. \n \nBehind him are the ants. They move like a terrible rolling wave along the hard-\npacked ground, and he can see every twitching antenna, every clenching \nmandible.
