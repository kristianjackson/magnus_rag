Original Statement given 9th December 2003. Audio recording by \nJonathan Sims, Head Archivist of the Magnus \nInstitute, London. Statement begins. \nARCHIVIST (STATEMENT) \nI did wonder why he left me anything in the first place. Philip Doah and I \nalways kind of hated each other. You know those friends you have who aren’t \n\nreally your friends, but you go to the same parties and it’s not enough of a \nthing that you’d actually avoid each other, so everyone just assumes you’re \nfriends and you kind of absorb that and even start picturing them there when \nyou think about “your friends” as a group, but deep down you both know you \ndon’t actually like each other, it’s just that it’s actually more effort to not be \nfriends? Well Phil was one of those. He was fine if you were discussing a movie \nand he was picking apart the dialogue or the casting choices, but whenever he \nstarted drinking, he got political, and let’s just say he was the sort of guy who \nthought that minimum wage was a bad idea. I don’t have particularly strong \nopinions myself, but it really wasn’t a rant you want to hear when you’re four \nbeers in. Especially when you’ve heard it plenty already. It was like, yeah Phil, \nwe know you got where you are through sheer hard work and determination, \nand the fact your parents gave you their second house as a 21st birthday \npresent didn’t help at all. Asshole. Not that I want to speak ill of the dead. \nAnyway, as far as I knew, my distaste for him was always mutual, so it came as \na real surprise to learn he’d left me something in his will. I’d love to make some \nflippant remark and say the only gift I needed was him falling under that train, \nbut truth be told his death actually hit me pretty hard. All of us felt it. I mean, \n37 years old. It’s an odd time to go. It’s not really in the realms of “tragic loss of \na young life so full of potential”, but it’s still a long way from “I guess it was his \ntime”. I guess it just hit all of us that we were entering the period of our lives \nwhere sometimes people die. Life was no longer a given, and it wouldn’t \nactually be as long as all that before funerals were starting to outnumber the \nweddings. This was back in February and I’d just turned 34, but it played on my \nmind. Mortality. I just kept thinking to myself: the moment I die will feel just \nthe same as this one. It’s not a thing forever in the future; I will be in that \npresent just as surely as I am in this one. And I will end.
