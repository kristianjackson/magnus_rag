And if \nyou were in the latter group, he honestly couldn’t care if you lived or died. Not \nthat most people could tell which side of the line they fell on. There were even \ndays that I wasn’t sure myself. Sometimes, I remember, he would invite people \nover to his studio that I was sure he hated, for screenings of his “original cuts”. \nI was quite jealous of this at the time, as I’d never got such an invitation, but it \nwas probably for the best. I didn’t realise it back then, but those guests … They \nnever looked quite the same afterwards. \nWe stayed in touch over the next few years, even worked together on The \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 136 – The Puppeteer \n9 \n \nWire Runner, his one underwhelming foray into CGI. He even kept in contact \nwhen I left to have my baby. It wasn’t planned, but while I may not have had \nmuch time for make-up and monster suits, the bodies inside of them were a \ndifferent matter. Anyway, even once I’d sorted out childcare arrangements, I \nfound myself more and more unwelcome in the industry. It wasn’t that people \nweren’t willing to hire me, by this point I had a hell of a special effects resume, \nbut the hours you were expected to be working, the way shoots were set-up, \nthe culture of drinking and networking, none of it was really possible alongside \nparenting. I only really heard about Neil’s work from what he told me: his \ndisappointment at the directors’ limited vision for the irradiated creatures in \nEagle Falls, or his satisfaction with his latest (and as it turned out, last) foray \ninto horror with The Harvestmen. He’d always had a fondness for spiders, he \ntold me, and I of course reminded him that harvestmen weren’t technically \nspiders. \nIt was around that time that he started to suffer his first symptoms. He told me \nlater his greatest regret was not being able to finish his final film: an arthouse \npiece simply titled Dancer. He never explained what it was about, nor do I \nthink it actually came out in the end. By the time it was due to start shooting, \nhe’d already begun to seize up. I became his carer a few months later. It just \nseemed to make sense. A frugal life, lucrative career and prickly personality \nhad left him with lots of money, but no real support; while my life had left me \nin a position where I cared deeply about his wellbeing and was in desperate \nneed of money. Everything just lined up so neatly. \nI will say this once, and you can draw whatever conclusions you wish from it. \nNeil Lagorio did not have Parkinson's disease. He began to have difficulty \nmoving, yes, but his mind remained razor sharp at all times, and his growing", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 3, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 2705}}
