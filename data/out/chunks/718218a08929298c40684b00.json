Is that real? \nI’m sorry, I know I’m meant to be telling you what happened. What brought \nme to this place. This place of books and learning, of sight and beholding. I’m \nsorry. I should. I will. \nI… I haven’t slept in some time. I can’t sleep. My dreams are crawling and \nmany-legged. Not just slithering and burrowing,. though it is the burrowing \nthat draws me. They always sing that song of flesh. I hope you will forgive me \nfor such a rambling story. I hope you will forgive me for a great many things, as \nit may be I do worse. I have that feeling, that instinct that squirms through \nyour belly. There will be great violence done here. And I bleed into that \nviolence. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG032 – hive \n3 \n \nDo you know, I wonder? As I watch you sitting there through the glass. Eating a \nsandwich. Do you know where you are? You called me “dear”. “Have a seat, \ndear.” “You can write it down, dear.” “Take as much time as you need, dear.” \nCan you truly know the danger you are in? \nThere is a wasps’ nest in my attic. A fat, sprawling thing that crouches in the \nshadowed corner. It thrums with life and malice. I could sit there for hours, \nwatching the swirls of pulp and paper on its surface. I have done. It is not the \npatterns that enthral me, I’m not one of those fools chasing fractals; no, it’s \nwhat sings behind them. Sings that I am beautiful. Sings that I am a home. That \nI can be fully consumed by what loves me. \nI don’t know how long the nest has been there. It’s not even my house, I just \nlive there. Some sweaty old man thinks he owns it, taking money for my \npresence as though it will save him. I used to worry about it, you know. I \nremember, before the dreams, I would spend so long worrying about that \nmoney. About how I could afford to live there. Now I know that whatever the \nold man thinks, as he passes about the house with brow crinkled and mouth \npuckered in disapproval, it is not his. It has a thousand truer owners who shift \nand live and sing within the very walls of the building. He does not even know \nabout the wasps’ nest. I wonder how long he has not known. How many years \nit has been there. \nHave you ever heard of the filarial worm? Mosquitoes gift it with their kiss and \nit grows and grows. It stops water moving round the human body right, makes \nlimbs and bellies swell and sag with fluid. Now, when I look at that fat, sweaty \nsack, I think about it, and the voice sings of showing him what a real parasite \ncan do. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG032 – hive \n4 \n \nHow many months has it been like this? Was there a time before? There must \nhave been. I remember a life that was not itching, not fear, not nectar-sweet \nsong. I had a job. I sold crystals. They were clean, and sharp and bright and \nthey did not sing to me, though I sometimes said they did. We would sell the \nstones to smiling young couples with colour in their hair. I remember, before I \nfound the nest, someone new came. His name was Oliver, and he would look \nat me so strangely. Not with lust or affection or contempt, but with sadness. \nSuch a deep sadness. And once with fear. It didn’t matter, because no-one in \nthe shop wanted to hear about the ants below it. I tried to tell them, to \nexplain, but they did not care. The pretty young things complained and I left. \nThat was when I still called myself a witch. Wicca and paganism, I would spend \nmy weekends at rituals by the Thames. I wanted something beyond myself, but \ncould not stomach the priest or the imam or pujari of the churches. I knew \nbetter. I knew that it was not so simple as to call out to well-trodden gods. I \nnever felt from my rituals anything except exhaustion and pride. I thought that \nthose were my spiritual raptures. \nI wish, deep inside, below the itch, that they were still my raptures. I have \ntouched something now, though, that all my talk of ley lines and mother \ngoddesses could never have prepared me for. It is not a god. Or if it is then it is \na dead god, decayed and clammy corpse-flesh brimming with writhing \ngraveworms. \nWhen did I first hear it? It wasn’t the nest, I’m sure of that. I never went in the \nattic. It was locked and I didn’t have a key. I spent a day sawing through the \npadlock with an old hacksaw. My hands were blistered by the end. Why would \nI have done that if I didn’t know what I would find? The face of the one who \nsang to me dwelling within the hidden darkness above me.
