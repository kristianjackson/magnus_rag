While the terms you have laid out are no \ndoubt more than adequate, I have, of these last months, come to the \nunfortunate conclusion that our intimacy and friendship must cease \nimmediately. I do not know what interest you have in the poor condemned \nsouls within those walls, nor do I care to guess, but in the light of what I have \nso recently witnessed, I can no longer in good conscience associate with any of \nyour endeavours, nor will I continue to collect or provide those accounts of the \nesoteric and otherworldly that you and your ‘Insititute’ so eagerly require. \nConsider this the severing of our acquaintance. \nThis cannot come as a shock to you. Surely you must have understood what \nyou were asking when you implored me to visit with Albrecht and apply my \nmeagre skills to the illness that beset him. You must have known the nature of \nthat illness, even if only in the most general terms, and no doubt you had some \nintuition as to its cause. But should all this be a true surprise to you, then I shall \ndo my best to explain, and hope that any revelations contained herein may \nsway you from the path you have started upon. \nI arrived at Albrecht’s estate early in April. The trees were dense with renewed \ngreenery, and the rain drummed heavily on the carriages as we approached. I \nremember it so clearly, the smell of the rain cut through with an unexpected \nwhiff of smoke, and as we get closer, I saw the orange glow of flame through \nthe trees. My first thought was that the house had caught fire and I would \narrive only to a scorched ruin and blackened bone, but as we got closer, I could \nsee that it was a single tree that was burning, a gnarled and ancient elm that \nsat removed from the rest of the forest. A small crowd surrounded the \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 127 – Remains to be Seen \n \n3 \n \nspectacle. One man, who I took be a groundskeeper, stood closer than the \nothers, with a lit torch in his hand. \nOn my instruction, the driver puller closer, though the horses were nervous, \nand I asked the man why they were burning the tree when the rain was coming \ndown so heavily. Surely it could have waited for dryer weather. The man \nsimply shrugged. My German is fine, though I have had little cause to use it of \nlate, but his accent was thick and all I could get was a sense of resignation and \nthe insistence that his master, who I took to be Albrecht, wanted the tree \ndead. I am sure that he used that word, though. Not ‘burned’, not ‘removed’ or \n‘destroyed’. Dead. I resolved to ask Albrecht about it when I saw him. \nAs it transpired, that was some time later than I had anticipated. As I’m sure \nyou're aware, Albrecht’s wife Carla was taken by a fever some years ago and \nhis sons were away at school, so it was the housekeeper who greeted me when \nI arrived. Greta, her name was, a pleasant red-faced young woman with a \nsmattering of English that she insisted on using at every opportunity. Once I \nhad dressed in dry clothes, she brought some food and a drop of brandy, all \nthe while making apologies that the master of the house was indisposed. I did \ntell her that I was a doctor, and specifically visiting in order to help end any \nindisposition, but she just shook her head and told me he’d see me when he \nwas ready. \nThe house seemed so empty. The rain battered on the window and the clocks \nticked away in every room, but there seemed no sound of life to be found \nanywhere. As I sat in the drawing room, I realised Greta had left the door \nbehind me open to the corridor beyond. I tried to ignore it, simply drink my \nbrandy and continue waiting, but I could not ignore the sensation that \nsomeone was out there, watchi", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 0, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 4500}}
