They seemed friendly enough apart from \nthat, and there never seemed to be any subtext or hidden meaning behind \ntheir greetings. Thinking back now, though, I’m not sure I ever saw any \nchildren, though maybe I’m reading too much into it. \nI found the… pit almost immediately. It wasn’t like it was something that could \neasily be missed, sitting there at the intersection of River Street and 6th, \ngaping up at the bright blue sky. It looked like a sinkhole, but almost \ncompletely circular, and instead of the sheer drop of most such holes, \n\nthis one sloped gently down towards a small opening at the centre, maybe ten \nor fifteen feet below street level. In some ways it seemed more like a crater \nthan a sinkhole, but it was so neat and regular, I didn’t think it could be the \nresult of any impact or explosion. It was huge, bigger than the street that \nshould have been there, and the thing that struck me as odd, was that the road \ncontinued around it. It seemed to split apart just before the pit, and come \ntogether on the other side of it. I mean, I don’t know if you can judge the age \nof a hole just by looking at it, but it didn’t seem that old. The road did, though, \nor at least it definitely hadn’t been put down recently. \nThere was no indication it had been laid separately to the rest of the town. The \npit was just there. \nAs I stood, staring at the hole in the ground, I heard a car coming up the road \nbehind me. I stepped to the side as it drove past and around the edges of the \npit, before continuing on. I glanced briefly inside the driver’s side window, but \nthere was no surprise on her face, no irritation at the obstacle. It seemed to \nhave barely registered. I left soon afterwards, weirdly unnerved by its… \nsmooth, circular presence. \nI asked Tommy about it the next day. He was reaching into the kitchen to grab \nme a beer, when I told him I’d stumbled across it when walking around town. I \nwondered did he know anything about it? How long had it been there? Was it \na sinkhole, or an earthquake, or… or what? It was only after I’d casually tossed \nout a whole series of questions that I noticed Tommy had frozen in place, one \nhand in the fridge and the other on the door. He didn’t seem alarmed or \nscared, just completely still. I was quiet for a few seconds, and then he took \nthe beer out and handed it to me, shutting the little fridge behind him. He gave \nno indication that he’d heard me. So I asked again, the pit on 6th and River, \nwhat was it’s deal? He looked at me for a while, like he was trying to puzzle out \nwhat I had said from a different language, then shrugged, and mumbled \nsomething about old roads not being properly maintained. “No,” I said, “the \npit. The big hole in the ground.” He just shook his head like I was talking \nnonsense, and headed off to his room. I tried to drink my beer, but it tasted \nthick and unpleasant on my tongue.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 2, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 3055}}
