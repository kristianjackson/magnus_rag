Basically, everything on-site was designed \nfor quick storage and processing any specimens for travel. Keeping a lab \nenvironment up and running in the middle of the Amazon was never really an \noption, so most of our job was focused on retrieving whatever they wanted \ntesting and making sure that it got to the actual lab intact, wherever that might \nhave been. \nI was part of the facility's permanent staff, and we were generally hired out by \ncorporations or universities who wanted to use our services for some project \nor piece of research they were conducting. My specific job was to head out \ninto the jungle, usually babysitting some weedy wannabe explorers who \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 149 – Concrete Jungle \n3 \n \ninsisted on coming along, and then snag whatever they needed to retrieve. \nCould be environmental measurements, tree cuttings, water samples and even \nsmall animals, though we’re not legally allowed to take anything bigger than a \nfrog. It’s actually really interesting work, although you do start to get a little bit \nbored of the same fifty square miles of jungle after you’ve been doing it for a \nfew years. \nAnd we’re very careful to stick to the bits of jungle we’ve been assigned, as \nwe’re right next to the Yanomami Indigenous Territory and accidentally \ncrossing into it ends up being a bit politically complicated, and even pretty \ndangerous if you cross paths with the wrong group. The Yanomami can get \npretty territorial. I mean, I guess you would be too if you had that many \ncompanies trying to illegally strip-mine your land. Still, it’s not usually a \nproblem. We stay in our area; they stay in there's. The worst part is the \nnumber of dickhead scientists who turn up with the same played-out Cannibal \nHolocaust jokes. It’s like, sure, technically they practice endocannibalism, but \nit’s just the bone-ash of their relatives and loved ones, so, you know, calm \ndown Dr Livingstone, there’s no way they’d respect your sweaty ass enough to \neven consider eating you. \nAnyway, I’m getting off topic. I usually head out with the other Specimen Tech, \nFernanda Machado, a local. And by local, I mean she’s from Manaus, about 200 \nmiles away. Brazil’s pretty big. And if there’s one thing she’s really good on \nthat I’m not, it’s the weather. I’m pretty hopeless at figuring out what any \ngiven day’s going to be like, and just have to rely on whatever weather site I’m \ncurrently losing faith in. It doesn’t help that the weather in the Amazon is just \nplain weird, with rains coming out of nowhere months before the winds should \nactually be bringing in the clouds, and no one knows why. But Fernanda, she \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 149 – Concrete Jungle \n4 \n \nmight not know why, but somehow she always knew when, to the point where \nif she said it might be bad, I would just cancel the expedition, no further \nevidence needed. \nNot that day, though. No, that day we had the world's pushiest climate \nscientist breathing down our necks. Dr Nikos Anastas. I mean, I’d read his \nstudies and he did good work, sure, but the way he acted, you’d have thought \nthat the oceans were going to drown us all tomorrow if we didn’t get out \nthere. And how he talked to us, like ... I mean, Fernanda and I were no \nstrangers to patronising scientists explaining our jobs back to us, but Dr \nAnastas was a whole other level. He talked to us like we were five-year-olds \nwho’d just asked him what recycling was. Fernanda was certain it was going to \nrain, but he’d “checked online” and it apparently said it was going to be fine. \nBesides, he had some real big money backing him, so we couldn’t really push \nthe issue. In the end, we went out into the jungle, and even I could tell that the \ncolour of the sky through the canopy was bad news. \nDr Anastas was looking to measure pollutant and plastic levels in some of the \nnearby rivers. The various ecological protection laws should mean that they \nhad virtually none of either, and he was looking into something to do with \npollutant transmission and chemical spread from industrial sites. If it hadn’t \nbeen for the standard NDAs they were always getting us to sign, I could have \nalready told him the sort of results he was going to get – he wasn’t the first to \ncome here for this kind of work – but my hands were tied. If you’re wondering, \nby the way, the answer is pretty damn polluted, largely due to various illegal \nmining and logging operations and land seizure in the area.
