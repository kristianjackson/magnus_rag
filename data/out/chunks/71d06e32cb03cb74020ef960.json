I mean, probably. But, y’know, well, I can’t see them, can I? \nBASIRA \nAh, yeah. Suppose not. \n(Beat) \nARCHIVIST \nI also killed Helen? \nBASIRA \nOh. \nRight. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 195 – Adrift \n \n22 \nARCHIVIST \nYeah. \n(Beat) \nBASIRA \nDidn’t expect that. \nARCHIVIST \nShe was dangerous. And not like the others out there. It was only going to be a \nmatter of time before— \nBASIRA \nNo, no, I get it. \nHonestly, it’s kind of a relief. How did Melanie take it? \nARCHIVIST \nMelanie? \nBASIRA \nYeah. She and… She and Helen were pretty tight back when, uh… Oh. \nARCHIVIST \nWhat? \nBASIRA \nBack when you were in your coma. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 195 – Adrift \n \n23 \nARCHIVIST \nI see. Well, I haven’t told her yet. So, I suppose I have that to look forward to \nwhen we get back. \nBASIRA \nIf we get back. \nARCHIVIST \nThat’s not the part I’m worried about. \nBASIRA \nHe’ll be okay. \nARCHIVIST \nHmm. \n(Beat) \nBASIRA \nI know a good way to take your mind off it. \nARCHIVIST \nI wouldn’t want to cramp your style. \nBASIRA \nHa! \nARCHIVIST \nBesides… we’re almost there. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 195 – Adrift \n \n24 \n[Tape clicks off] \n[Tape clicks on] \n[Gentle waves against a shore; footsteps on shingle and sand] \nBASIRA \nSo we’re just gonna leave the boat? \nARCHIVIST \nWould it make you feel better to know that it’s not technically real? \nBASIRA \nNo. \nARCHIVIST \nLook, it’s fine. We probably won’t even be coming back this way. \nBASIRA \nIf you say so. \nSo anyway, run this by me again, they’re like a proper cult, cult? \nARCHIVIST \nIsh. They all seemed fairly normal given the circumstances. Bit of a let-down in \nsome ways. \nBASIRA \nBut like, they actually worship Melanie and Georgie? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 195 – Adrift \n \n25 \nARCHIVIST \nWorship is maybe a bit strong. They just... revere them. \nBASIRA \n(Laughs) Melanie must hate that. \nARCHIVIST \nAnd that’s the issue. I’d say it’s as culty as it can be, when the ‘leaders’ are \nactively trying to stop it. \nBASIRA \nOh it must have been funny though— \n[Static and glitch crackles as they transition between domains] \n[Their footsteps are now on pavement, a few birds tweet] \nHuh. \nHang on, is that—? That’s the real sun isn’t it? \nARCHIVIST \nYes. We’ve entered the, uh... um… \nBASIRA \nJohn? \nARCHIVIST \nSorry, I should have said. The camera, it... it blocks my connection, and I, uh... \nIt’s hard. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 195 – Adrift \n \n26 \nBASIRA \nAre you okay? \nARCHIVIST \nIt doesn’t matter. Martin’s here, and we need to find him. \n[Faint sound of the Archivist’s voice coming from a tape recorder] \nARCHIVIST ON TAPE (BACKGROUND) \n(Crosstalk) …this one dressed in baggy overalls. Next to it stands a much \nsmaller fly— \nBASIRA \nOkay, how do we do that? \nARCHIVIST \nI, uh… I, I, I don’t know. We’ll have to— \nBASIRA \nShh! Do you hear that? \n[The tape recorder gets louder as they approach] \nARCHIVIST ON TAPE (BACKGROUND) \n(Crosstalk) —dressed in what appears to be a child’s version of those same \noveralls. \nBASIRA \nThere.

Great. \n(Archivist exhales) \nARCHIVIST ON TAPE \n(Crosstalk) They are both openly weeping. ‘IT’S MR. HORSE.
