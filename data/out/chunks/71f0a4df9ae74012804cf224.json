I did \nnotice something in the corner though. About a half dozen small bones, with \ncarvings on each face. Dice. I knew that dice games pre-dated the Old Kingdom \nby some time and these were excellent quality. I decided to wait until Stavo \nhad finished ranting before I drew his attention to them. \nI turned to see him leaning over the corpse, rage on his face like it was \nsomehow this dead Egyptian's fault that the trip had been a bust. I had to stop \nmyself laughing, until I saw that he might actually punch the thing. The \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 064 – Burial Rites \n \n10 \n \nmummy was the only thing in that place aside from the dice that we had any \nhope of selling and I couldn't let him damage it. I shouted at him to stop and \nhis eyes fixed on me with hatred burning behind them. I explained to him \ncalmly and reasonably that the mummified body before him might be worth a \nlot of money. This did seem to calm him down a bit and he was just starting to \napologise for his outburst when he went completely still. \nHis eyes were wide and he had gone deathly pale. I stepped a bit closer and as \nmy torch travelled down from his face and along his arm, I saw it. A blackened, \ndesiccated hand gripping his wrist, the thin fingers clenched tight. It was \nmoving. It was alive. \nIt opened its eyes, but beneath those brittle eyelids were empty crevices \nwhere they had long since rotted away. It opened its mouth as though to \nscream, but no sound came out at all. I remember thinking of course it can't \nscream, it doesn't have any lungs. Lack of jars meant this would have been a \ncheaper mummification and they would have liquified all the organs over the \ncourse of 70 days. Was this thing alive when that had happened? Was it buried \nin salt for 70 days, feeling the cedar oil slowly melting its insides? \nThese thoughts ran rapidly through my mind as I stood there, frozen in terror. \nThe sound of Stavo's pistol shocked me out of my stupor. He always carried a \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 064 – Burial Rites \n \n11 \n \ngun when he went on a dangerous job and he was emptying it into the glossy \nflesh of the mummy before him. Each shot sent shards of dry skin and dusty \nbone flying off it, but it didn't stop moving. Not even when he shoved the gun \nin the corpse's mouth and blew off the back of its skull. \nIt had released him now and Stavo turned to see the others had already fled \nback from the chamber, heading towards the surface, following the cable back. \nThe strange, half-dead creature had spasmed its way off the raised platform \nnow, onto the floor, and lay between me and Stavo. And the door. He gave me \nan apologetic look, and then ran, leaving me alone with the thing. \nThe broken, juddering mummy began to drag itself towards me. It was still \npartially bound in the tight burial cloth, but that didn't stop it making its \npainstaking way over the dusty ground. There was plenty of room to run \naround it, it wasn't even that fast, but my legs just wouldn't work as it got \ncloser and closer. Its mouth opened and closed stiffly, dark brown dust falling \nfrom it in a steady stream. I have no idea how it knew I was there. It had no \neyes, no nose. There's no way it should have been able to detect me, but it \nknew, and crawled directly towards me. \nI managed to reach to my hip and pull out my own weapon, a large hunting \nknife I'd picked up on our last trip to North America, more because its weight", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 4, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 3616}}
