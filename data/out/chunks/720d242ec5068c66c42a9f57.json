He didn’t even seem hurt. But looking at how still he lay there, \nthe terrified, awful expression frozen on his face, there was no chance he was \nalive. On his motionless chest, and around the base of the bookshelf, I saw \nmore of those tiny bones. \nThat’s where my memory begins to blur. I know I made it back to the \nbasement of the Reform Club, where Rachel was waiting with the police. But I \nthink I got some of the wrong passageways first. I have the vaguest memories: \nflashes of a pile of paper, completely covered in cobweb; a figure stood in the \ndarkness, a stranger I didn’t know but was sure meant me harm; my skin \nburning, hot, choking on smoke down there in the dark. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG035 – Old Passages \n10 \n \nWhen I was out, I was questioned by the police, who followed Rachel in to \nretrieve Alf’s body and were successful, though they came back out pale and \nshaking. There was no sign of Gerard, nor had Rachel seen him. I was then \nquestioned again by the staff of the Reform Club, who instructed us in no \nuncertain terms to rebuild the wall and finish our original job. We were given \nto understand that the police were handling the matter, and if we pursued it \ncloser then we would not be getting any further work from members of the \nclub. As this covers almost everybody who can afford our services, we \ncomplied. It makes me feel sick, though, like we’re just abandoning Alf, \ndishonouring his memory. It’s not even like he had any family to miss him, it \njust feels wrong. I guess, maybe, that’s why I’m talking to you. Do try to keep \nmy name out of it if you follow it up though, okay? \nJONATHAN SIMS \nStatement ends. \nOn the one hand, this statement represents a complete dead end, as no-one \ninvolved is both able and willing to talk to us. Over the last three months Sasha \nhas attempted to contact Mr. Silvana, Rachel Turley, the management of the \nReform Club and any of the police officers involved. All of them flatly deny any \nof this ever took place. Alfred Bartlett’s death was listed as a heart attack \nsuffered during routine maintenance work, and none of the coroner’s reports \nprovide any details out of the ordinary. The “kid”, who I think it is reasonable \nto assume is none other than Gerard Keay, remains just as impossible to \ncontact as he ever was. From an evidence standpoint, this case is a complete \nbust. \nHowever, too many of the names and features match with other statements \nfor me to dismiss it, not to mention the fact that business records do list Jurgen \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG035 – Old Passages \n11 \n \nLeitner as having hired out an office on the ground floor of 100 Pall Mall \nbetween 1985 and 1994. He was apparently one of the premier worldwide \ndealers in rare and antique books at the time, with items selling for the sort of \nsums where an office in Pall Mall doesn’t raise any eyebrows. If this strange \nbasement is really there, then perhaps his choice of location was not simply a \ndisplay of status. Clearly some of his books were there, and I can’t help but \nwonder whether that was where they were found, or just where they were \nstored. \nThe other major point of interest is the fact that this complex appears to have \nbeen designed by Robert Smirke. You should have seen Tim’s face when I told \nhim. Architecture is one of his specialist areas, and he has always talked of \nSmirke as one that fascinates him. How did he phrase it? “A master of subtle \nstability.” From a professional standpoint, it also interests him that Smirke’s \nbuildings have higher percentages of reported paranormal sightings than any \nother architect of similar profile. He hasn’t been able to find much out about \nthe Carlton Club specifically, at least not anything relevant to this statement. In \nhis later years, following Smirke’s official retirement in 1845, there were all \nsorts of rumours about his interests and religious preferences. If there was a \nscandalous sect or bizarre cult, his name would always be seen mentioned \namong those meeting with them. He also started putting his name forward to \ndesign churches, despite his claimed retirement. He was never taken up on \nthese offers. Interesting, but fundamentally not that useful for the case in \nhand, especially since we have been unable to get permission to physically \ninvestigate whether this place even exists. It seems we’ve reached something \nof a dead end. No pun intended.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 6, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 4444}}
