He \nturned to see the figure still sat at the table, but now the old monk’s robes \nwere soaked with blood. The bones of the figure were red and dripping, with \npatches of muscle appearing over them. \nThen he felt it in himself. Something was very wrong. An itching, burning deep \nwithin him, then a flash of intense pain in his arm. He grabbed it instinctively, \nbut where he touched it, the skin and flesh beneath it came away in his hand, \nlike chunks of wet bread. Beneath it, he could see the yellow-white of bone. \nHis bone. Old bone. And the soldier began to scream. \nAs more of his body sloughed off of him into crimson piles upon the floor, he \nlooked up at where Death had sat. In its place he saw an old monk, bloody but \nwhole, smiling at him. The soldier held out a now bony hand towards him in \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG029 – Cheating Death \n9 \n \nsupplication: “You said that if I won, then I’d live!” The monk shook his head. \n“No, I didn’t.” \nThe end, I suppose. Thank you for indulging me, you’ve been very patient. I’m \nwell aware I came in to tell you my own story, and instead have rattled off \nsome old folktale, which you’ve dutifully taken down. I do feel now, though, \nthat I’m at a place where I can tell you of myself. But for one final bit of \ncontext, I need you to watch this. Pay attention. \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nArchivist’s note, After this point the rest of the page is covered in what appears \nto be a large bloodstain. The statement resumes on the page afterwards, in a \nsomewhat shakier hand. \nJONATHAN SIMS \n(Read a loud from the archived witness statement of Nathaniel Thorpe) \nApologies for that. A bit dramatic I know, but I always feel a demonstration is \nbest in these situations. Are you feeling better now? Well, regardless, I think I \nshould continue; best get this down before someone comes to check on your \nscream. I’ve no interest in being becoming a resident medical marvel. \nSo yes, this is not a trick knife. You can check yourself if you want. Hell, stab me \nyourself if you care to. No? Fine. Perhaps I underestimated your curiosity. \nAfter I won my game of faro, I spent almost two centuries in that unhallowed \nstate. I remember little of that time. I was not the only one, nor was I the sole \nembodiment of Death. There were others, I think, in a similar state to me. I \ndon’t know how many, but we didn’t come for everyone. I don’t know how we \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG029 – Cheating Death \n10 \n \nchose our victims, or whether we were at the whims of a higher power. I call \nthem victims, as while we visited many a terminal or doomed soul, we did not \nonly visit those whose time had come. Some of them we killed ourselves. I \nremember my bone-sharp hands reaching into the throats of the old, the \nyoung, those who deserved it, and those who brought nothing but love to the \nworld. \nSome would choose to gamble, of course. The foolish ones chose chess. I was a \nmaster of every game, knew every rule. To select the one game with no luck in \nit at all was always folly. In the end, it was roulette that released me. Luck \nbended in my favour when I played with victims, but with a game so pure in \nrandom chance as roulette, well, eventually, luck comes around, though I had \nto wait damn near two centuries for it to do so. I’ll never forget the look on \nthat old man’s face when he won, and began to feel the change overtake him. \nSo now I’m here, and I cannot die. I can barely live, either. Food and drink \nmake me sick, and I cannot sleep. There is an aching inside of me. A craving for \nsomething, but I don’t know what. I don’t seem to age, but I’ve only been flesh \nagain for a few years, so can’t be sure of this. I have often wondered about \nwhether I’m the only one like me in the world. I can’t be. It doesn’t make \nsense. I know there were others. But I don’t know where. \nI can’t decide whether this existence I find myself in is better than the death I \nfeared so long ago. I sometimes wonder, but have decided that it is. A living \nhell is, after all, still living. \nJONATHAN SIMS \nStatement ends.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 4, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 4148}}
