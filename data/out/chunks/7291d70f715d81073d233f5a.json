I could just \nignore it. I didn’t move even after I’d filled my mug; I just stood there sipping \nmy tea, not even noticing that it was still far too hot to drink comfortably. \nWhen I finally got the nerve to step back out into the hall, the coffin still lay \nthere, unmoving. I finally made a decision and, firmly gripping the padlock, I \nremoved the key, and placed it on the hall table next to the door. I then took \nhold of the coffin and chain and started to pull it further into my flat. It was \nweird to touch it: the wood still had that unsettling warmth to it, but the chain \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG002 – Do Not Open \n7 \n \nwas as cold as you’d expect from a thick piece of iron, and apparently hadn’t \ntaken on any of the heat. I didn’t have any cupboards with enough space to \nhold the thing, so in the end I just dragged it into my living room and pushed it \nup against the wall, as out of the way as possible. I cut up the cardboard box it \nhad been sealed in and put it with the rubbish outside. And just like that I had, \napparently, started storing a coffin in my home. \nAt the time I think I assumed it was full of drugs, at least as far as I assumed \nanything about the situation. Why anyone would store something in such a \nnoticeable way or with a total stranger like me, these weren’t questions I could \neven guess at an answer to, but I decided it was best to think about it as little \nas possible. \nFor the next few days I avoided my living room, as I found being so close to the \nthing made me nervous. I was also staying alert for the smell of any sort of rot, \nwhich might indicate there was something dead inside the coffin after all. I \nnever smelled anything, though, and as the days passed I found myself noticing \nmy mysterious charge less and less. About a week after it arrived, I finally \nstarted using my living room again. I’d watch TV, mostly, and keep half an eye \non the unmoving casket. \nAt one point I got so cocky as to actually use it as a table. I was drinking a glass \nof orange juice at the time and absent-mindedly placed it on top of the lid, not \nreally realising exactly what I had done. At least not until I heard movement \nfrom underneath it. I froze, listening intently and staring, willing myself to have \nbeen imagining things. But then it came again – a soft but insistent scratching, \njust below where I had placed my glass. It was slow and deliberate and caused \ngently ripples to spread across the surface of my juice. Needless to say I was \nterrified. More than that, I was confused. The coffin had been lying in my living", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 4, "chunk_count": 9, "chars": 2700}}
