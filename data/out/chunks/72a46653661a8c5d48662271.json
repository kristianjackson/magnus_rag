I \nhad but a few books with me and Wilhelm, despite his not-inconsiderable \nintelligence, had even fewer. In the end, we played a lot of cribbage and \nlistened to Clara play many a tune on the pianoforte. My wife has never had a \nsingular voice, but her skills upon the keys more than make up for it. I myself \nwould often take long walks through the surrounding woods during the early \nafternoon, when the cold was tolerable. Sometimes I would make my way the \ntwo miles to neighbouring Schramberg, but more often I would simply choose \na direction and stroll into the trees for as long as my fancy held me and then \nsimply follow my own trail of footprints back to what was, for the moment, my \nhome. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG023 – Schwartzwald \n5 \n \nIt was on one of these walks, some months into our stay, that I came upon that \nancient graveyard. It must have been sunken slightly into the ground itself, as \nall I could see of the grave markers themselves were the merest tip of worn \nand crumbled granite above the snow. I could not guess at the size of the \nplace, as every few seconds, whichever way I walked, I would spot another \nsmall bud of memorial stone blossoming through the frosted earth. I dug some \nsnow from in front of one of the headstones – it had a broken angel atop it, \nboth wings snapped and fallen – but the inscription was far too worn to make \nout any of the words. I had all but made up my mind to leave, as I knew I had \nlittle over an hour before the light began to fail me. As I turned to do so, \nhowever, I spied something not far removed among the trees, far larger and \nmore intriguing than the graves I had found thus far. \nIt stood about five feet proud above the snow, and the stone was far better \nquality than what I had seen so far. A small mausoleum. The door, once a \nsturdy iron grate, had long since rusted off of its hinges, leaving only a gaping \nblack aperture that seemed to lead deeper than the dimensions of the \nmausoleum would allow. Over the top, barely readable, but still most definitely \nthere, was the name ‘Johann von Württemberg’. I was fascinated – I knew my \nlocal history well enough and certainly was not aware of any noble of the \nWürttemberg line named Johann. I was sure he had never been a count or a \nprince. More than that, there had never been, as far as I could recall, any town \nor settlement near this spot that could have supported a cemetery of such size. \nSo who was Johann von Württemberg, and why had he built a mausoleum \nhere, in the middle of the Schwarzwald, six miles or more from Schramberg? \nI had no time to investigate any further, for I realised that I needed to leave \nimmediately if I was to return to my wife and nephew before sundown.
