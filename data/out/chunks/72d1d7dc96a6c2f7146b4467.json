Original statement given April 22nd 2012. Audio recording by \nJonathan Sims, Head Archivist of the Magnus Institute, London. \nStatement begins. \nJONATHAN SIMS \n(Read a loud from the archived witness statement of Nathan Watts) \nThis all happened a couple of years ago, so I apologise if some of the details are \na bit off. I mean, I feel like I remember it clearly but sometimes things are so \nweird that you start to doubt yourself. Still, I suppose weird is kind of what you \nguys do, right? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG001 – Anglerfish \n4 \n \nSo I’m studying at the University of Edinburgh. Biochemistry, specifically, and I \nwas in my second year at the time this happened. I wasn’t in any sort of \nuniversity accommodation at this point and was renting a student flat down in \nSouthside with a few other second years. To be honest I didn’t hang out with \nthem much. I took a gap year before matriculating and my birthday’s in the \nwrong part of September, so I was nearly two years older than most of my \npeers when I started my course. I got on with them fine, you understand, but I \ntended to end up hanging out with some of the older students. That’s why I \nwas at the party in the first place. \nMichael MacAulay, a good friend of mine, had just been accepted to do a \nMaster’s degree in Earth Sciences so we decided a celebration was in order. \nWell, maybe ‘party’ isn’t quite the right word, we just kind of invaded the \nAlbanach down on the Royal Mile and drank long enough and loud enough that \neventually we had the back area to ourselves. \nNow, I don’t know how well you know the drinking holes of Edinburgh, but the \nAlbanach has a wide selection of some excellent single malts, and I may have \nslightly overindulged. I have vague memories of Mike suggesting I slow down, \nto which I responded by roundly swearing at him for failing to properly \ncelebrate his own good news. Or words to that effect. \nLong story short, I was violently ill around midnight and made the decision to \nwalk the route home. It wasn’t far to my flat, maybe half an hour if I’d been \nsober, and the night was cool enough that I remember having a hope the chill \nwould perk me up some. I headed for the Cowgate and the quickest way to get \nthere from the Royal Mile is down Old Fishmarket Close. \nNow, I’m sure you don’t need me to tell you that there are some steep hills in \nEdinburgh but Old Fishmarket Close is exceptional, even by those standards. At \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG001 – Anglerfish \n5 \n \ntimes it must reach a thirty or forty degree angle, which is hard enough to \nnavigate when you don’t have that much scotch inside you. As I have \nmentioned, I had quite a lot, so it probably wasn’t that surprising when I took a \nrather nasty tumble about halfway down the street. In retrospect the fall \nwasn’t that bad compared to what it could have been, but at the time it really \nshook me up and left me with some nasty bruises. \nI picked myself up as best I could, checked I hadn’t seriously injured myself, no \nbroken bones or anything, and decided to roll a cigarette to calm myself. That \nwas when I heard it. \n(Emphasised voice) \n“Can I have a cigarette?” \n(Jonathan Sims continues reading the statement) \nI was startled out of my thoughts by the words as I thought I had been alone. \nQuickly trying to compose myself and looking around, I noticed a small \nalleyway on the opposite side of the street. It was very narrow and completely \nunlit with a short staircase leading up. I could see a light fixture a little way up \nthe wall at its entrance, but it either wasn’t working or wasn’t turned on, \nmeaning that beyond a few steps the alley was shrouded in total darkness. \nStood there, a couple of stairs from the street, was a figure. It was hard to tell \nmuch about them as they were mostly in the shadows, though if I’d had to \nguess I would have said the voice sounded male. They seemed to sway, ever so \nslightly, as I watched, and I assumed that they, like me, were probably a little \nbit drunk. I lit my own cigarette and held out my tobacco towards them, \nthough I didn’t approach, and asked if they were ok with a roll-up. The figure \ndidn’t move except to continue that gentle swaying.
