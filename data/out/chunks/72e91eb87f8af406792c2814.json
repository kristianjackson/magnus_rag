Episode eighty-two. The \nEyewitnesses. \n[The Magnus Archives Theme – Intro – Continued] \n[Tape clicks on.] \nDAISY \nFine. \nMARTIN \nSorry. I just… I feel more comfortable with it on. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG082 – The Eyewitnesses \n2 \n \nDAISY \nI said it was fine. \nMARTIN \nYeah, right, so, um… Statement of Martin Blackwood, interviewed by Detective \nD– Tonner. February 18th, two thousand and – \nDAISY \nWhat are you doing? \nMARTIN \nI… I’m making a statement. Isn’t that what you want? My statement? \nDAISY \nNo. I just need you to answer the question. \nMARTIN \nOh. Okay. I mean, y-you wanted a statement last time. About…it was… when I \nfound Gertrude. Or at least your partner did. \nDAISY \nDidn’t know who the killer was last time. This time it’s simpler. And… And \nBasira’s not a police officer anymore. \nMARTIN \nOh. Look, y-you’re sure it was him? I mean, I know, I know… but I can’t… He \nwouldn’t! (Pause) \nI… I don’t think it was him. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG082 – The Eyewitnesses \n3 \n \nDAISY \nYou think we should be looking for other suspects? \nMARTIN \nWh– N-No! No, I mean, not – Look, that tape that we gave you… \nDAISY \nHas a lot of distortion, some screaming and a recording of you seeing the body, \nyou claim for the first time. Always suspicious when two suspects are each \nother’s only alibi. \nMARTIN \nI told you that there was someone else there. It may… \nDAISY \nWhich one should we be asking, by the way? The man with the knife hands or \nthe woman trapped in your ‘magic corridors’? \nMARTIN \nIt. Happened. \nDAISY \nWell, if your witnesses appear back in this universe, maybe the situation will \nchange. Otherwise, it’s an easy choice: answer my question or I pin it on you. \nMARTIN \nY-You can’t! Th-That’s not how this works. (Pause) Is it? \nDAISY \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG082 – The Eyewitnesses \n4 \n \nLet me tell you how this works, Mr. Blackwood. I’ve got a hell of a workload, no \npartner, and full operational discretion to make this whole situation go away. \nThat means you help me, or I make things very unpleasant for you. \nMARTIN \nBut you’re the police! \nDAISY \nSo, help me stop a killer. Where is Jonathan Sims? \nMARTIN \n(Pause) I don’t know. \nDAISY \nDon’t lie to me. \nMARTIN \nI don’t! \nDAISY \nEveryone I’ve talked to says you and him were close. \nMARTIN \nWhat? Did they? I mean… I mean, who said that? I, I, I guess, I mean, more \nthan the rest, yeah okay, but – \nDAISY \nDid he have any other friends? Anyone outside the Institute he might have \ntalked to? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG082 – The Eyewitnesses \n5 \n \nMARTIN \nI… No, I don’t really… think so. I don’t, don’t think he had much of a life outside \nof this place. \nDAISY \nThere’s nowhere? No-one he might turn to? \nMARTIN \nHe never talked about his friends, worked all hours… No. I’m sorry. \nDAISY \n(Sighs) Right. Get lost. Send Stoker in. \nMARTIN \nThat’s it? \nDAISY \nUnless you know something else. \nMARTIN \nWhat about Sasha? \nDAISY \n(Sighs) No sign of her body here or in the tunnels. No evidence she was the \nvictim of violence. Maybe she saw the murder, or caught Sims smashing up the \nstorage room, and took off. Maybe she’s with him. Or he killed her, too. Either \nway, quicker I find him, the better for her, so if there is anything you’re not \ntelling me… \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG082 – The Eyewitnesses \n6 \n \nMARTIN \nNo. I just… Bring her back safe, okay? (Pause) I’ll send Tim in. \n[Martin leaves, the door opening and closing.] \nDAISY \nTim Stoker. (Pause) That your name? \nTIM \nYeah. \nDAISY \nYou want me to leave this running? \nTIM \nNo. You can turn it off. \n[Tape clicks off. Tape clicks on.] \nDAISY \nHm. \nTIM \nHuh. Seems about right. Look, just… just leave it on, or do you want to do this \nsomewhere else? \nDAISY \nIt’s fine. \nTIM", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 0, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 4141}}
