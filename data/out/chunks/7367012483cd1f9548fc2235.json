In that tiny, sliver of affection, lay a whole universe of doubt. The \nsort of doubt that the torturing Flame Incarnate cannot have, but that too \nmany years spent in silent patience, followed by one clumsy flirt in a coffee \nshop could create. A tiny, hairline fracture which destroys everything. \nWhen she told us... I have known anguish and destruction like few in this \nworld, but the memory of that night still makes me shudder. The sadness and \ngrief we felt at what we knew we had lost. It was Agnes herself that suggested \nit. If we tried the ritual and failed, she said, it might be hundreds of years \nbefore we had the strength to try again. But if she ceased, not in culmination \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 139 – Chosen \n9 \n \nof fire, but a cold and quiet death, perhaps her spark would return to the \nLightless Flame, and she could try again. Not immediately, and likely not even \nwithin my remaining lifetime, but sooner than if she burned. \nAnd so we hanged her, as she requested. All because of that most insidious of \nemotions, hope. We have allowed Jude free reign on what happens to the \ncoffee shop boy, though Agnes asked her not to interfere. She has not yet \nharmed him, but I cannot imagine what is going through her mind, the misery \nand pain he has brought upon himself. For all her anger, she is not rash, and I \nfear her quiet consideration far more than I worry about her temper. It may be \nhe lives for the remainder of his natural life, but she will make sure he is never \nhappy, and never without pain. \nAs for you, whatever you did, and whatever protection it might have afforded \nyou is severed with Agnes’ death. Arthur has told us not to harm you yet, but \nthis whole thing has really rather weakened his authority, and many of us are \nnow looking towards Diego for leadership. But we shall see, I suppose. I hope, \nwhen it is time, we may burn you forever, Gertrude. \nARCHIVIST \nStatement ends. \nNice to see Gertrude also got a lot of threats. So far, it doesn’t seem that any \nwent desperately well. Except for Elias, of course, but he didn’t threaten, did \nhe? He just… did it. \nI’m curious to see what it was she did to derail this big ritual, because I’m sure \nshe didn’t pay poor Jack Barnabas to fall in love with Agnes. Well, ninety \npercent sure. No-one’s come seeking vengeance recently, though, and looking \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 139 – Chosen \n10 \n \nat the details for the British Steel plant in Scunthorpe, it does seem like Eugene \nis still around, so I can only assume some sort of equilibrium was found. Given \nwhat happened when I met Jude Perry, I’m not in any rush to track him or any \nof them down myself. Diego, I assume to be Diego Molina, who Basira crossed \npaths with back in her sectioned days, and Arthur... could be Arthur Nolan, \nthough going from the head of a cult to watching over Jane Prentiss as a \nlandlord does seem like something of a demotion. God knows. It’s not like I \ndon’t have my own office politics to keep track of. \nThe others are doing... better, I think. Basira’s busy doing research for \nsomething secretive, unsurprisingly, but she seems to be adjusting to, uh, the \nnew Daisy. I actually like Daisy now, which is, uh, a really weird feeling. \nMelanie’s quiet, but I think therapy’s helping. Haven’t seen Helen much. The \ndoor is sometimes there, sometimes not. I haven’t knocked. I’m never going to \ntrust it. Trust her. Trust it. And I shouldn’t. Whatever it’s relationship to the \nperson who was or is Helen... assuming that I can ever know its motivations is \na mistake. And that just leaves Martin, which... \nWhy were we chosen? Agnes was created, crafted with a specific purpose, so \nfinely tuned that even a grain of uncertainty threatened the entirety of her \nbeing, but I’m so full of doubt it feels like there’s no room for anything else, \nand I’m sure Martin is the same. Is there destiny here? Bloodlines and \nprophecies? Or, or did we just… stumble into this? Maybe we’re the opposite \nof Agnes. Maybe our doubts are exactly what we need. If, if that’s the case, I’m \na… an amazing chosen one! \nDunno how that would work though. I’m just worried about Martin.
