Sort of. I always find myself using the words ‘craftsman’ or \n‘artisan’, but that’s mostly because of my client base. I specialise in renovation \nand alterations on listed buildings and those of historical or architectural \nsignificance. In simple terms it’s not much different to any other sort of \nconstruction work, except it takes about three times as long and costs ten \ntimes as much. That’s not to say I rip people off. You need to spend almost half \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG035 – Old Passages \n2 \n \nthe time just planning exactly how you’re going to tackle any given job, while \npreserving or recreating the original architecture as much as possible, and then \nyou have to be incredibly careful when you’re doing the work. I’m quite serious \nwhen I say that if you’re not paying attention and keeping the alterations well-\ndocumented, you can get sued for millions over knocking out the wrong brick. \nPlus, the materials aren’t cheap. So yes, my services are expensive, but me and \nmy team are worth every penny. And the sort of people I deal with, or should I \nsay the sort of people whose personal assistants I deal with, can afford it. \nI don’t have a company, per se. People hire me for me, and I have a small team \nI trust to help out with the work itself. They’re technically freelance \ncontractors, but the pay’s good enough and, in London at least, there’s enough \nwork that they’re happy to wait on my call. \nI’ve found plenty of interesting things in this job. I suppose that’s not \nunexpected when you’re digging around old buildings. We got kicked off a job \nonce when we found some bones under a very venerable country house that \nwill remain nameless, as the owners contacted the British Museum, who \ncouldn’t take over fast enough. There have also been a few jewellery pieces \nthat found their way to other museums, and once we found a box of 17th \ncentury erotic poems that I think are currently languishing in the storerooms of \nthe V&A museum. But I never found anything like what was under 100 Pall \nMall. \nWe’d been called in to do some work on the basement and ground floor of the \nReform Club. It wasn’t anything major. Some upkeep on a few of the historic \npieces, replace a few of the earlier renovations. The amount of actual work \ninvolved was minimal, but it was a Grade I listed building, so the amount of \ncare we had to take stretched it into a week-long job. It didn’t help that we had", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 0, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 3215}}
