And yet it was not this that inspired in me the need to write \nyou an account. It was what occurred but two days past, for I was in my \nobservatory making my notes and adjustments as my position requires, when I \nwas called upon, not unusually, by the President of the Royal Society. I was \nastonished at how cordial his conduct seemed, his temper even and his heat \nsteady, but it was not the attitude of the President that robbed my tongue of \nspeech. It was that in his visit he was accompanied by Edmond Halley. My dear \nRaymer whose body had gone cold and still in my own cruel hands. He had \nlittle to say, it seemed, as the President went over once again some detail of \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 140 – The Movement of the Heavens \n \n11 \n \nmy equipment, and Raymer, who was and is dead, simply watched me in \nsolemn silence. Were it not for his handing books to the President I should \nhave thought him a shade or a haunt, but his substance was far more than \nsuch could ever achieve. \nAt length Mr Newton took his leave, and Raymer went to follow. Before his \ndeparture, an exit that could not come too soon for my nerves, he turned \ntowards me and grasped me firmly by the shoulders. In my shock and fear I \noffered no fight and returned his gaze as he began to thank me. His gratitude \nwas so plain and sincere that I could scarce understand it as he spoke, but he \nrepeated it again and again. Thanking me for his life, for his freedom. I stared \ninto his eyes, and though they met mine, I saw spreading inside them the \ndarkness and mist. Whether he be blind now I know not, but those were not \nthe eyes of Edmond Halley, though they were the eyes of my Raymer, the one I \ncouldn’t destroy. \nIt is with this at the forefront of my thoughts that I write to you Abraham. I \nknow you have some small acquaintance with him and I must warn you: Halley \nis no longer Halley. He may appear as such and ape those previous \nobservations of his own and those more skilled, but it is not him. Look into his \neyes and you will know. \nYou will know. \nARCHIVIST \nStatement ends \nRight. \n[Tape clicks off. Tape clicks on.] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 140 – The Movement of the Heavens \n \n12 \n \nBASIRA \nSo? \nARCHIVIST \nSo Edmond Halley was Rayner. Or, at least, whatever was inside him. You said \nit was dead, though. \nBASIRA \nI thought it was. We shot him to hell before he could, uh, pour himself into \nthat kid. \n(The Archivist grunts in acknowledgement.) \nBASIRA (Cont.) \nBut I mean, didn’t you say he got blown up in World War I as well? \nARCHIVIST \n(Burbles) Possibly. The… uh, the details are... It’s not exactly clear. \nBASIRA \nYou don’t... Know? \nARCHIVIST \nNo. And I’m not about to push my luck and try to force it. Besides I, I rarely get \nanything when The Dark is involved. I-It’s a bit of blind spot. \nBASIRA \nHmm. Point is, we can’t be sure. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 140 – The Movement of the Heavens \n \n13 \n \nARCHIVIST \nAgreed. \nBASIRA \nYou don’t Know what the ritual for The Dark is, right? \nARCHIVIST \nNot really, no. Um, based on this and everything— Something to do with the \nSun. I would guess. An eclipse, maybe? \nBASIRA \nI don’t think so. There’s not one due for a while, and I’ve been wondering for \nages, why Ny-Ålesund? I mean, sure, that far north it gets dark for a long time, \nbut there’s also really long days in the summer. \nARCHIVIST \nOkay. \nBASIRA \nBut I think... Have you got a pen? \nARCHIVIST \nUh, yeah, i-in the drawer. \n[Drawer opens] \nBASIRA \nUh... John. What’s this? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 140 – The Movement of the Heavens \n \n14 \n \nARCHIVIST \nHmm? Oh! \nThat’s... uh, th— uh, that’s my rib. \nBASIRA \n… \nRight. \nARCHIVIST \nYup. \nBASIRA \nAnd the jar of ashes? \nARCHIVIST \nNot, not mine. I mean, it belongs to me, I-I guess, but it’s not— Stationery is in \nthe other drawer. \n[Another drawer opens, pens rattle] \nBASIRA \nRight. Thanks. \nOkay. \n[Paper rustles] \nNow, look here.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 3, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 4075}}
