Obviously, he drugged me. That’s the only explanation that \nmakes sense. It was the only way he could get me in there and drugs can affect \nhow you see all sorts of things. Even time. It’s just... it felt so real. I felt every \nsecond and I checked my watch and... but I’ve taken all sorts of drugs in my \nlife. I experimented plenty with psychedelics in my youth, and this didn’t feel \nlike being drugged. It felt like being eaten. No, not eaten … entombed. \nIt was his own damn fault. I’ve been working Customs long enough and we all \nknow the drill; he should too. You bust the sloppy ones; you bust the ones you \nthink might involve whatever the higher ups are coming down on hard that \nmonth. But most smugglers are small fry. You keep your paperwork in order \nand we’ll keep out of your way, as long as you give us the same courtesy. I \nknow that Mikaele Salesa shipped through Portsmouth all the time. I never \ndealt with the man directly, but he should have made sure to keep his \ndocuments clean. As it was, I had to hold his shipment. Not enough grounds \nfor an immediate full search, I made that clear to him, but if he didn’t get his \npapers in order quickly, we’d have no choice. \nI still remember how he stared at me, stood in that shipping container, \nsurrounded by flight cases and sealed metal boxes. That level, even stare. He \nwas appraising me like some sort of antique, like he was curious what my value \nmight be at auction. Then his face turned to a scowl of irritation and he \ngestured widely to his cargo, offering me the chance to examine it if I thought \nhim a criminal. His voice was deep, calm and measured, but his eyes had an \nanger in them that scared me. I looked around the container, not so much to \nlook at the contents, but just to avoid his gaze. Truth be told, I hated my job. It \nwears you down, to be someone who nobody wants to see. Smugglers and \ntraffickers hate me because I threaten to disrupt their business, I understand", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 0, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 2847}}
