It was largely up to me to take care of it after his death. My parents \nwere taking it very hard and weren't well enough themselves to make the \njourney down to his small house in Southampton to try and organise his \nmeagre possessions. I suppose I wasn't in a good place to begin with. You're \nnot meant to die of a stroke that young. I mean, he was only 38 and he wasn't \nexactly the healthiest, but it… it just seemed so unprovoked. \nI've always been quite religious and believed that things happened for a \nreason. Blessings ultimately came to the virtuous and misfortune to the \nwicked, but now I don't know. Perhaps you could say that my curiosity was a \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 060 – Observer Effect \n \n4 \n \nfault that brought this on me, but I didn't open the box because I was curious, I \nopened it because I had to in order to fully inventory my dead brother's \npossessions. I honestly don't think that's a transgression. It wasn't even \nmarked as special. No oak chests or triple locked brass boxes, just another \nbrown cardboard box like any other. \nI don't think that anything about it struck me as special. Looking back, I feel like \nit marked itself, that it drew my eye, and I would stare at it for longer than the \nother boxes piled up around his house. The place was so quiet. A lonely \ntestament to Christopher's isolation. He'd never married and there seemed to \nbe nothing in that dingy home that said he had any friends to speak of. In a lot \nof ways, it reminded me of my own life. I have friends enough in Norwich, but \nno family except Christopher and my parents, though I do have my reasons. \nStill, looking through my late brother's things led to the sort of reflection that \nmakes me uncomfortable, and I was drinking more than I normally would. \nIt was my second day down there when I opened the box. I'd been going \nthrough all his old document boxes and there were a lot. Christopher had \nworked for the history department at the University of Southampton. I don't \nknow what he specialised in; we never really talked about his work. But based \non what I found in his study, he'd written a few books on the subject of ancient \nmyths and fetishes: those objects that were believed by various cultures to \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 060 – Observer Effect \n \n5 \n \nhave supernatural or religious power imbued within them. His first book was \non the holy cross of Christianity and how it operates as a fetish within our \nculture. This offended me a little bit. I was worried he was trivialising a faith \nthat, as far as I knew, he shared with me. Still, I tried to read a chapter of it (on \nthe use of the cross in the vampire myth) but it was very dry and, quite frankly, \na bit dull. \nMost of the boxes were similar, full of notes and clippings and bits of research \nthat meant absolutely nothing to me. I put these aside to check with Angus \nCartwright, one of Christopher's colleagues who I had contacted to have a look \nat what papers of his I couldn't understand. Some of the boxes, however, \ncontained what I can only assume was practical research: fetish objects and \ntotems from all around the world, small animal figures carved from bones, \nstrings of glass beads tied together in intricate knotted patterns, grotesque \nquasi-human statuettes made of wood and old leather. Some of them were \nmore than a little bit unsettling, but only one managed to send me spiralling \ninto the place I am now. \nAs I said, it was one of the last boxes I opened on the second day. It was late \nand I had already made my way through most of a bottle of wine. The more I \nthink about it, the more I think that opening that box felt no different to any of \nthe others.
