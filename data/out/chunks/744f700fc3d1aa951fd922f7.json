I will \nnot deny he was a handsome man. Even now, the cold has preserved that \npleasing cast of his face, gaunt though it may be. I was somewhat taken with \nhim, but had no further thoughts about it, being somewhat plain in my own \nappearance. It took me quite aback when I brought a jug of water to his fire \nthat evening and he asked me directly if there was anywhere in the town of \nSavannah where he might find a wife. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 058 – Trail Rations \n \n4 \n \n \nWell, this seemed to me something of a strange request, though I myself knew \nlittle of courting. Benjamin explained that he was set to be travelling up out of \nSt Joseph along the Oregon Trail towards the Willamette Valley, a lush paradise \nof the frontier. The settlers of Oregon Country, he said, had offered land to \nthose who might follow. 320 acres of land for the unmarried, he said, but a \nmarried settler could claim 640 acres. That, and the prospect of another pair of \nhands to help with the work of farming, was a great incentive. All told, he said, \nif he was able to find himself a wife before he reached Oregon Country, he \nvery much intended to do so. Well, after he told me this, I explained my \nsituation to him, and we were married by Pastor Lawrence the following day. \nEven now, I can’t fully bring myself to regret that part of the events that led me \nhere and, had we reached the Willamette Valley as planned, I believe we \nwould have been far happier than most. \nI had few real possessions to pack and little food left, but I took what I could \ninto Benjamin’s wagon. It was late May when we began our trip and, had I \nknown more about the route we were to take, I might have known that this \nwas dangerously late to be starting such an expedition, but I did not. In many \nways, Benjamin was as impulsive in his travel plans as he was in choosing a \nwife, and it was only after we had been on the road for some time that I \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 058 – Trail Rations \n \n5 \n \nrealised how ill-prepared he was for many of the hardships of the trail. I never \nasked him exactly where he was from or why he wished to settle in Oregon. \nThose few times I broached the subject, he would talk all sorts of circles \naround it, and I had some inkling that he might have been fleeing trouble back \neast. I never pressed the matter. I had a lot of gratitude to him for taking me \nalong, sharing his food and his bed with me and rescuing me, as I saw it, from a \nlife of grief and Missouri dirt. \nIt became apparent as we travelled that the blessings were not entirely one-\nsided. It turned out I was far more suited to the hardships of the trail than him \nand far more skilled at keeping the wagon moving than he was. I nursed him \nthrough a fever as we crossed through Colorado and more than once I even \nmanaged to avoid an attack by natives, securing the wagon in a small ravine \nuntil the war party had passed by. All told, I feel I more than earned my bacon. \nI still remember the first time Benjamin saw skulls near our campsite, those \ntravellers before us who had not fared as well as we had. Poor man almost \nfainted and I could not help but reflect that, were it not for me, he would likely \nhave joined those poor departed souls. I decided not to share that particular \nreflection. \nWe reached the Laramie River and Fort John in October. It was a squalid little \nfur trading post in Wyoming, with thick wooden walls that were solid enough", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 1, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 3732}}
