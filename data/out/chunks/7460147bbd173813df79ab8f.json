Little Nellie’s coffin began shaking and rocking back and forth, such as \nthey were unable to keep their footing and dropped it. The crash of the wooden \ncasket hitting the earth is a sound I’ll not forget in a hurry, nor the shriek that \ncame from inside the splintered wood as it burst open. \nAs you may well have surmised, Nellie was not, after all, dead, and had shaken off \nthe stupor mere minutes before she was due to be placed below ground. She’s \nunharmed, at least in body, though I can scarce imagine the maddening strain \nmust have put on her to see her own tombstone carved and waiting above the \ndark silence of her open grave. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 152 – A Gravedigger’s Envy \n8 \n \nTo be honest, I suspect the worst effect is upon the Reverend. To be so near \nresponsible for burying a person alive has shaken him deep, and he stopped all \nfuneral services for a time. \nTo my mind there are far worse fates. But he has in his head an idea to begin \nfitting the graves I dig with these new “safety bells” that he has heard of, so that \nany as might be alive below ground might signal us above for rescue. \nI dread the idea. If it had been me in that coffin, destined for the peace below \nground, I can think of little that I would hate more than the jarring, clanging of a \nbell pulling me from my rest. \nMy dreams have been strange, of late. \nYours, \nHezekiah \nDecember, 1838 \nI’ve been thinking, Nathaniel, of funerals and bodies. Souls that escape leaving \nthis common clay to become one again with a truer clay. Were we not created \nfrom mud? And it seems more fitting to me that we should return forever to that \nmud, not pulled from it by some would-be Redeemer, or lifted to sing hosannas in \nhis holy court. \nI’ve worked so long, so hard. Do I not deserve a rest in the mud from which I \ncame? Commit my body to the earth and let it stay there. I’d do the same for you. \nFor worship of the Most High - though it may be earned, perhaps, by He that \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 152 – A Gravedigger’s Envy \n9 \n \nmade the heavens and the earth - well, to my mind, all that prayer still sounds a \nlot like work. \nDo you know what the Reverend said in his sermon the other day? He said that in \nthe Kingdom to come there will be no need of sleep - that we shall never need to \nmiss a moment of that bliss. But sleeping in the cool, soft dirt is all the bliss I could \never ask for. \nI suppose the Lord would have no call to think such things a blessing. He was \nnever buried, was he? Not truly. Laying in a cave for three days, a rock pushed \nacross the entrance before being taken up bodily – no, He was never buried. \nAnd He always had more work to do – harrowing hell and redeeming the sins of \nmankind. No, He had no rest, and never asked for it, save a moment of doubt at \nGethsemane. But He is the son of God and we are merely sons of the dirt. We are \nnot as strong as He is, and we deserve rest. We deserve to sleep. \nI’ve been trying to sleep, but that bell kept ringing, the one over Jacob the baker’s \ngrave. That nonsense safety valve the Reverend insisted on putting there, ringing \nand ringing, and disturbing the sleep of everyone in the churchyard. I’ve no doubt \nit disturbed Jacob as well, who worked so hard all his life and never thought to \ncomplain of his lot. \nHe deserved to rest. So I cut the cord. And now he is quiet. \nI can’t get my clothes clean anymore. And my shovel is never far from my hand. \nYours,", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 3, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 3503}}
