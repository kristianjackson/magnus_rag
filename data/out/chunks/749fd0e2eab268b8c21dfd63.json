The death of a few have never been more than an \ninconvenience, and that’s all she was ever really capable of. You were not the \nfirst to try and stop us, you know, not even within living memory.

That’s the thing about darkness, isn’t it? \nYou try your hardest to eradicate, flood your surroundings with light, but it’s \nalways there at the edges, waiting for the glow to weaken, to return and cover \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 143 – Heart of Darkness \n \n9 \n \nyou forever. Robert Montauk discovered that the hard way, and someday, so \nwill your Gertrude. \nBut we got so close. We touched it. There is another world, a world of still and \nquiet darkness, where no heat touches and death cannot find you. You might \nwander beneath that empty sky of void forever and never see a light to guide \nyour way. No left, no right, no up or down, only forward into the crowded, \nshivering gloom. For that night is not empty, far from it. Things move there: \nthe sounds of shuffling, scuttling, crawling. A scream. The fall of gentle \nstagnant raindrops that chills you as you try desperately to know if that is the \nsound of the storm or something out there? It is a world of the fear of \ndarkness, and as I began to see it, I felt again that celestial terror that had not \ngripped my heart since first I gazed upon the pitch-black sun that I had created. \nThe scream was mine and it was joined by uncounted voices in fearful song. I \nwas complete. It was so very close. \nWe were to slice a hole in the world, and this paradise would flow through the \nwound like ink, smothering the sun and all its children. Maxwell had always \nhad the visions, the drive. Whatever was inside him pulled him to this end, to \nthis great undertaking, like a magnet, and I was so very honoured to be his \nright hand. Natalie and the others followed, but they did not truly understand, \nwith their talk of peace and unity and “Mr Pitch” – a friendly name to try and \nhide from a concept they couldn't grasp. Vardan Darvish had an inkling, I \nthought, but he crossed a Montauk, which has, traditionally, gone poorly for \nus. But as the hours turned into days and the final dusk got closer, it seemed as \nthough all the uncertainty was washed away. \nI don’t know exactly when it all started to come undone. I think Maxwell first \nfelt the ripples four days before the eclipse was due. It was strange, like a \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 143 – Heart of Darkness \n \n10 \n \npause in the hysterical whimpering and fruitless prayers of the sacrifices and a \nripple that was felt through the waters and the stagnant blood that bound us. \nA disruption. We would later learn that this was the collapse of the ritual at \nHither Green, but it was only the first. Our congregation in Alaska disappeared \nthe next day, and Russia as well. One by one, it seemed our scattered \nwhisperers of night were falling, and holding it together, keeping the lightless \nworld anchored to our star, bringing it closer, was becoming an almost \nunbearable strain on Maxwell. I helped as I could, but without knowing what \nwas happening there was little I could do to stabilise it. I began to drown the \nsacrifices, too soon, perhaps, but it worked to keep it going and keep it \ntogether. Until at last, we felt it: the eclipse. \nWe had been worshipping in the deepest dark, and yet when it crossed the \nsun, I felt it roll over us like a cooling balm on a summer's day, plunging us into \na deep, black void far more complete than I can ever convey with mere words. \nIt was more than beautiful; it was divine. And as we unveiled our new and \nabsent son, the sacrifices who remained screamed and fell in holy agonies, and \nthe world of endless night we had been promised began to pour in, shining out \nand all around us.

All at once, that loving embrace was \nstripped from us, and it began to retreat, to recede back into the place that it \nhad come from. We were so close. We were so close.
