I have pleaded with the Lord to give me strength, to help shield \nme from the things I have sought these many decades, to protect me as my \nend draws near. I do not believe my prayers have been heard. \nLast night I was awoken by a noise from the drawing room. I was in my own \nbed, and the moon shone through the window, casting the place into a pale \nand sickly hue, though it was illumination enough to assure myself I was alone. \nThe noise came again, however, and I called out to Laura, asking if she had \nwoken in the night. There was no reply. I struck a match and lit my meagre \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 138 – The Architecture of Fear \n \n12 \n \ncandle, clinging desperately to its small pinprick of warmth and light, and I \ncrept towards the drawing room. The door opened slowly, and the room \nwithin was in pitch darkness, the heavy curtains having been drawn across the \nwindow. In the sputtering glow of the candle I could see a figure stood in the \ncorner opposite the door. It wore a long nightdress, and seemed at a glance to \nbe my dear, sweet Laura. I let out a breath and began to settle myself, asking \nher what she was doing out of bed. She did not respond, however. She \nremained silent instead, facing into the corner of the room. I approached, \nslowly, that restored confidence fleeing me as swiftly as it had arrived, and \nasked her again. This time she began to turn, with such a slowness I was \nreminded instantly of the driver. I started to speak again, but at that moment \nmy candle went out, plunging me into abject darkness. \nI fumbled desperately for a match and, finding one in my nightgown, I struck it \nin a panic, casting sudden light on my surroundings. Laura’s face was inches \nfrom my own, her eyes staring into mine, so wide that they seemed to take up \nhalf her face or more, bulging grotesquely from their sockets. I screamed, just \nonce. She gave no response of her own. I wanted to run, to lock myself in my \nroom, but under the sight of those horrible eyes my entire body seemed to \nfreeze, and I stood there, match held aloft, eyes locked with this awful parody \nof my daughter. After an eternity, the flame reached my fingers and I dropped \nthe match, letting the relief of darkness wash over me. I stood there until \nmorning, only to find Laura gone. It was then I began composing this letter. \nLaura, of course, claims no knowledge of the night’s events having no memory \nof even leaving her chamber. \nThe Eye has marked me for something, of this I have no doubt. My humble \nhope is that it may be a swift death, an accidental effect of your own \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 138 – The Architecture of Fear \n \n13 \n \nresearches, which I once again implore you to abandon. It is likely too late for \nme, but I will not— \n[Paper rustling] \nMARTIN \nThe, um, the letter ends there. Uh, a-apparently Robert Smirke was found \ncollapsed in his study that evening, dead of, uh, “apoplexy”. I d— I don’t know \nhow the letter reached the Archives. I mean, well, I can guess, but... \nSo, so what? What does it mean? Am I supposed to be reassured that new \nentities can be born? That there’s some, some kind of precedent for The \nExtinction? \nPeter? \n… \nHuh. Maybe he has gone to a party. Anyway, Smirke was clearly wrong about \nthe Powers balancing each other, at least. I mean, i-it-it’s obviously impossible. \nThere’s too much variation in, in how much something is feared by people at \nany one time. \nAnd, and if that’s the case, I suppose it’s not impossible that Peter... might be \ntelling the truth. I don’t know what he’s talking about when he mentions \nMillbank. The old prison, I guess. Tim said the tunnels under the Institute were \nall that was left of it, but John said he’d checked them pretty thoroughly. \n(Heavy sigh.) I’m not the one who knows all about this stuff. I wish— No. No, \nit’s fine. I’m fine. I… I can do this. I don’t know what Peter’s planning, but my, \nmy guess is that it might involve something below the Institute.
