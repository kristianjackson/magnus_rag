And… you’re a hard person to talk \nto. \nANNABELLE \nWhy? Because of what I say, or because of the assumptions you make about \nmy motives? \n(Martin makes a frustrated exhale) \nMARTIN \nEither. Both. \nANNABELLE \nI see. \n(Beat) \n(Martin makes an annoyed noise) \nWe could play a game? \nMARTIN \nUhhh… \nANNABELLE \nTwenty questions? Animal, vegetable or mineral? \n(Martin makes an annoyed exhale) \nMARTIN \n(Sarcastic) Animal. Does it have eight legs? Yes. Is it a spider? Yes. Oh look, I \nwin. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 197 – Connected \n13 \nANNABELLE \n(Smiling) On edge are we? \nMARTIN \nOf course I am! You’ve stuck me in a weird interdimensional web, and \nthreatened to fill me with spiders! \nANNABELLE \nNo. I said I had “considered” filling you with spiders. \nMARTIN \nY-yeah, whatever, the point is, there was a time when it was very much your \ngo-to option! And this one time I chose to almost trust you, you’ve \nimmediately turned around and used me as bait! \nANNABELLE \nI haven’t broken your trust. \nMARTIN \n(Sputters) Wh-what!? \nThe deal was you’d tell me a way to end this without John trapping himself in \nthat tower. Using me to trap him here instead, in the most hackneyed \nmetaphor imaginable, is not exactly what I had in mind. \nANNABELLE \nPerhaps I was wrong about how well suited you are to us. I’m not sure you \nhave the patience for The Web. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 197 – Connected \n14 \nMARTIN \nOh piss off. \nANNABELLE \n…You don’t need to worry about John. \nMARTIN \nYou’re literally luring him into a trap. This trap. This one right here. \n[Martin motions and twangs the web, setting off strong \nreverberations] \nANNABELLE \nPlease don’t do that. \nTechnically, yes. This is a trap. But the only one in actual danger is going to be \nme. If he chooses to kill me I can’t stop him. Not even here. And you’re not \nbait, you’re just... an invitation. \nMARTIN \nOh. Wonderful. I can’t wait to attend the Annabelle Cane Show. \nANNABELLE \nHuh! You know, I did consider it once. \nMARTIN \nExcuse me? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 197 – Connected \n15 \nANNABELLE \nA TV show. Reaching out into the homes of millions, giving the more \nvulnerable ones a subtle nudge towards terror. Probably something for \nchildren. It never went anywhere, of course. These things rarely do. \nMARTIN \nI’m, I’m sorry, what are you talking about? \nANNABELLE \nYou’re the one that didn’t want to wait in silence. \nMARTIN \nW— Yeah, well— \n[A low vibration, with some chitinous, rewinding tape sounds \npassing] \nWait… Wait, hang on, is that him? \nANNABELLE \nYes. I guess you’re better with the Web than we thought. \n[Multiple chitinous rewinding tape sounds pass] \nMARTIN \nAnd— Wait, ha— No, uh… is that… Basira? He, he’s got Basira with him! \nANNABELLE \nYes. \nI did wonder if that would be the case. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 197 – Connected \n16 \nInteresting. \nAnd unfortunate for me. That’s two heads we’ll need to keep cool. My odds \naren’t looking good. \nMARTIN \nOdds don’t matter if you’ve stacked the deck. \nANNABELLE \nTrue. Now settle back. Try to look... intentional. \nMARTIN \nWhat does that mean? \nANNABELLE \nThey’re going to expect a suitably elaborate scene when they arrive, a \nmonstrous tableau. I’d hate to disappoint them. \nMARTIN \nRight... \n[Martin gingerly tries to adjust his position] \nSo, w-were you thinking something like this, or—? \n[Annabelle releases a burst of webbing, gagging Martin and \nwrapping him firmly] \n(Muffled indignancy from Martin)", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 2, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 3659}}
