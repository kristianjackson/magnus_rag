Still watching me. There's nowhere I can go, no place I can hide \nthat it doesn't keep looking at me. I don't know why. No idea what it wants \nfrom me, or if it ever had any plans beyond just staring from wherever it is \nhiding. I can't eat. I can't sleep. It's been months now and it's still there. You \ncan't see it, I know. I can't see it either, but that doesn't matter because it can \nsee me. That's what matters. I can feel its gaze burrowing into the back of my \nneck. Does it hate me? Does it just want me to keep living in fear? I don't know \nwhy this is happening to me. \nAt first, I thought it was a person, some stalker who just kept hiding. I had this \nthought that if I kept feeling something was watching me, then it must be a \nperson doing it. There must be someone following me. It's not like I haven't \nhad stalkers before. I started to scan the faces of everyone I passed, looking to \nsee if I recognised them, if I'd seen them before anywhere. Did I recognise the \nman in the green overcoat from the bus this morning? Did that bike messenger \nloop around the road and pass me again? (Sigh) No, they never did. Never. No \none was following me, but something was watching. It still is. \nThe strange thing is it's a feeling I should be used to. I've been watched by \npeople for years. I present the 'Look East' segment for BBC news almost every \nday. Well, I used to. And on the other end of that camera there were tens of \nthousands of people. But I never felt it from them. Sometimes, as I kept my \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 060 – Observer Effect \n \n3 \n \neyes locked on that camera, reeling off the latest string of burglaries, I tried to \nfeel it. Tried to imagine all the people seeing me, watching me. Even then, \neven when I was trying, it was never more than a dead, empty lens. Maybe it's \njust as well that I never felt it before. I lost my job within two weeks of this \nfeeling coming over me. I couldn't concentrate. I couldn't look at the camera. I \ncouldn't read the dead, empty words on the page. I ended up having \nsomething of an on-air breakdown. I guess it's lucky you're based in London so \nyou couldn't have seen it. \nI know the moment it started. Looking back, it all seems so arbitrary, like a \nswitch suddenly being clicked on and all at once my life is destroyed. It was \nthree months ago in April. I was doing inventory for some of my brother's \nestate. It was largely up to me to take care of it after his death. My parents \nwere taking it very hard and weren't well enough themselves to make the \njourney down to his small house in Southampton to try and organise his \nmeagre possessions. I suppose I wasn't in a good place to begin with. You're \nnot meant to die of a stroke that young. I mean, he was only 38 and he wasn't \nexactly the healthiest, but it… it just seemed so unprovoked. \nI've always been quite religious and believed that things happened for a \nreason. Blessings ultimately came to the virtuous and misfortune to the \nwicked, but now I don't know.
