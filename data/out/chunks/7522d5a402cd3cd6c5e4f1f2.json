It seemed to mingle with her grief, so \nthe sadness over her own lost son would manifest in recriminations and \nbitterness. \nSaying this aloud I worry I’m painting too bleak a picture of my grandmother. \nShe cared for me as well as she was able, and whatever her private feelings \nmight have been, she did try her best. \nAnd I was hardly an easy child to deal with. While I may not have shared the \ninclinations of my peers towards active mischief, I was precocious and \nimpatient, quick to talk back, and even quicker to wander off whenever I grew \nbored. By the time I was eight, the police had had to return me from my \nexplorations at least three times, and my grandmother swore that if it \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG081 – A Guest for Mr Spider \n4 \n \nhappened again she would begin locking me inside the house. And I fully \nbelieved her. \nShe did discover that the one thing that could keep me rooted to the spot were \nbooks. Television pacified me for a half hour or so, but a book would keep me \nin place until I had finished it, and for all the voracity of my reading, I was \nnever actually that fast, lingering on pages that caught my imagination. So in \nthis she saw a solution. The difficulty was I was also very picky, and looking \nback on it there was little rhyme or reason to what I did or did not care to read. \nI never tried to really define it, but I think the closest I could come to putting it \ninto words was that I hated to read anything I felt like I had read before. This \nmade it something of a nightmare to keep me entertained, as any author with \na distinctive enough style would only ever afford me a single book’s worth of \nreading before I tired of them. I can still hear my grandmother’s voice, trying to \nhide that irritation bubbling up: “But you like Diana Wynne Jones!” \nIn the end, she came up with a solution that now seems like a stroke of genius, \nalthough at the time I found it strange and bothersome. The local library was \nsome distance away, so between visits, my grandmother would go to all the \nlocal charity and second-hand bookshops and buy up every book they had that \nwas fifty pence or less, then she would present me the pile and I would look \nthrough it until I found something I liked, or at least tolerated, and then I \nwould read that. After I was completely done with the pile, she would donate \nit to one of the other charity shops. \nIt wasn’t something that could be kept up forever, but it worked for longer \nthan you’d think. It was shortly after she had started with this system that I \nfound… my first Leitner. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG081 – A Guest for Mr Spider \n5 \n \nOne of the things that annoyed me most about my grandmother’s approach \nwas that she never seemed to exercise any sort of judgement at all about how \nappropriate something might be for me. I didn’t mind this so much when it let \nme read a slightly-too-gruesome thriller, but she would also often present me \nwith stacks full of bright, square cardboard books, of the sort you’d read aloud \nto a pre-schooler. These bothered me far more than any dull technical manual \nor dog-eared dictionary, as I couldn’t help but feel it was making a comment \nabout my intelligence. I mean, obviously that was absurd – I watched my \ngrandmother grabbing the books without even glancing at their covers, just \nchecking the price and stacking them. But somehow, it still felt like an insult \nthat she might in some way think I was at a level to be reading The Elephant \nand the Balloon, or whatever nonsense it was. \nSo, when searching through the latest trove of books, I felt my hand grip \nanother square, thin volume, I almost discarded it without even looking. But I \ndid look. And what I saw immediately struck me as odd. Instead of the garish \ncolours that I expected, the cover was monochrome, matt white with scratchy \nblack webs covering its corners, and in the middle of the cover, half-written, \nhalf-carved in a childlike hand was the title: A Guest for Mr. Spider. \nOn the back cover there was no blurb, just a crudely sketched image of what I \nassumed to be the eponymous Mr. Spider. He stood upright on his spindly back \nlegs, attached to a disproportionately swollen abdomen. The rest of his legs \nwere splayed at odd angles, as though in the middle of some sort of dance, and \nhis head had no mouth, but was covered asymmetrically with eight eyes of all \nshapes and sizes. On the top of it there sat a small bowler hat, which had been \ndrawn in a splash of re", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 1, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 4500}}
