The Magnus Archives. Episode one hundred and ninety-\none: \"What We Lose.\" \n[Theme finishes] \n[Tape clicks on] \n[Sounds of light breathing in sleep in a quiet chamber in \nthe tunnels] \n[Some agitated movements; sleeping bag zipper and \nbedding rustles] \n[Martin sleep-mumbles, then awakes with a start] \nMARTIN \nJohn? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 191 – What We Lose \n \n2 \n[Turns over to check] \nMARTIN (CONT’D) \n(Surprised) Ah! Argh! Stop it! John! \n[The Archivist wakes up] \nARCHIVIST \n(Muzzily) Mm, what? What? What is it? What…? \nMARTIN \nSorry. Sorry, I— It’s fine. I was… I was just startled. We’ve not been many \nplaces you can sleep, so I— \nARCHIVIST \nSo, what? \nMARTIN \nYou were sleeping with your eyes open again. \nARCHIVIST \nAh. Right. \nMARTIN \nJ-just took me by surprise. \nARCHIVIST \nSorry. Not something I can help, I’m afraid. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 191 – What We Lose \n \n3 \nMARTIN \nNo, I, I, I know, I know, um. I’m sorry. It’s okay. \n(Martin and the Archivist sigh) \n[Fabric rustles] \nARCHIVIST \nBad dream? \nMARTIN \nIs there any other kind? \nARCHIVIST \nFair. \nMARTIN \nSpeaking of, how are your dreams? I know they used to be... y’know, \ncomplicated. \nARCHIVIST \nI don’t know. I don’t really remember them anymore. Honestly, it’s not really \neven sleep these days. I can only do it when I’m disconnected from... well \neverything, and it’s more like… You know that feeling when you’re right on the \nedge of falling asleep? Not quite dreaming, but not aware of stuff either? \nMARTIN \nHuh. So, like, standby mode then? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 191 – What We Lose \n \n4 \nARCHIVIST \n(Soft laugh) I suppose. \nWhat was I like at Salesa’s? \nMARTIN \nOh, you’d just completely conk out. Eyes open, obviously ‘cause, god forbid the \ncreepy ever stops entirely, heh, but— \nARCHIVIST \nThank you. \nMARTIN \n—you’d just be dead to the world. I actually got a bit worried, once or twice, \nbut you always woke up fine. \nYou said you didn’t dream. Sounded pretty happy about it too. \nARCHIVIST \nI imagine I was. \n(Beat) \nMARTIN \nHey, I meant to ask. Do you recognise that woman, Celia? \nARCHIVIST \nUm... no, I, I don’t think so. Why? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 191 – What We Lose \n \n5 \nMARTIN \nI’d- I swear she gave a statement once. \nARCHIVIST \nWhat statement? I don’t… I don’t remember anything. Wh— Not down here at \nleast. \nMARTIN \nIt was... (mumbles something softly) \nI thought she was making stuff up! Heh. I gave her some money. \nARCHIVIST \nWhy? \nMARTIN \nSh-she asked. \nARCHIVIST \nRight. Do you think she remembers? \nMARTIN \nI mean, she doesn’t seem to remember her own name, so I’m guessing... No? \nARCHIVIST \nYou could ask? \n[Faint echoing footsteps] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 191 – What We Lose \n \n6 \nMARTIN \nWell, no, that’d just be weird. I mean— \n[Soft knocking on a flimsy door] \nMARTIN (CONT’D) \nHello? \n[Door opens] \nUNNAMED \nSorry. Didn’t wake you, did I? \n(Small huh noise from Martin) \nThey asked me to check in on you. \nARCHIVIST \nNo, it’s fine, we were up. \nMARTIN \nDon’t think we’ve met. I’m Martin, this is John. \n[Rustling and sounds of sleeping bag zipper opening] \nARCHIVIST \nHello. \nUNNAMED \n(Suspicious) Right. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 191 – What We Lose \n \n7 \nMARTIN \nAnd you are…? \nUNNAMED \n(Firmly) No. \nMARTIN \n“No”? As in your name’s No? \nUNNAMED \nNo, as in ‘you don’t get to know my name’. I’m not stupid. \nARCHIVIST \nIs that so? \n[Sound of shoes being put on] \nUNNAMED \nNames are how they see you; the-they’re how they find you in the files. You \ncan hide all you want, but if they know your name, they can see you. And take \nyou away. \nARCHIVIST \nI see.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 0, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 3980}}
