Occasionally, when they \nfirst began to take over, I would start to march up to them, my mind whirring, \nfilled with demands and threats and ultimatums. Then they’d look at me with \nthose blank, impassive eyes, and I’d feel all my resolve simply melt away. \nNow it’s just a memory. A daydream. I’ve forgotten the taste of determination. \nIt won’t last forever, though, because I think they’ve decided they’re done with \nme. \nI came into work yesterday to find a box sat on my desk. The address and label \nhad been completely scribbled over in black marker pen, and it was impossible \nto tell from what was left where it had originally been sent to. It didn’t matter, \n\nthough, because on top of it, written in my handwriting with a vicious precision \nI’ve always lacked, were the words: “Return to Sender”. \nThey’d put it there for me. They’d never delivered to me before. The package \nwas still, but every part of me recoiled from it. I slowly walked forward and \ntouched it, but I did not pull away the tape. The day was warm but the box was \nice cold, and the cardboard was spongy and strangely yielding. It didn’t move \nwhen I pressed it with my hand, but there was a sound like shifting sand. \nI don’t know what was inside. I don’t what is inside. It won’t be right. It’s not \nmy package. I didn’t send it. \nI tried to look it up in the logs. I found it easily enough. Everything seemed to \nbe in order, except the item description. That line simple read, “Goodbye”. \nGod knows how long I spent staring at it. Nothing about that box was right. The \ncard fitted together at slightly-off angles, and the corners were damp, like it \nhad been left out in the rain. The table seemed to bend slightly under its \nweight, yet when I tried to move it, it seemed so light I doubted for a second it \ncould have anything inside. Even then, I never dared to fully lift it up or pull it \ntowards me. There’s a gravity there, though, and I don’t know how much \nlonger I can resist its pull. \nMy brother came to you people about ten years ago. He had been having \nvisions of demons and witches, and came discuss them with you. He never \nrecovered, but he always told me that there was little quite as freeing as \nmaking a statement for you. So I snuck away. But I need to be back soon. It has \nbeen freeing, talking to you, but not enough to free me from my fate. I am not \nthe sender, but I am going to open that package. I know I leave Breekon and \nHope Deliveries in safe hands. Safe hands where the skin feels wrong. \n\nStatement ends. \nARCHIVIST \nI found Mr. Breekon. The real one. It’s strange, for all he talks of worrying that \nwhat’s in the box will get him, all the bite marks appeared to be coming from \nthe inside going out. \nWhat does it mean when death no longer phases you, even the most \ngrotesque? Perhaps it’s a sign I’m adapting to my new situation. Useful, I \nsuppose, but… I was right about the Newcastle depot. It’s still here, and it \nseems like it’s been deserted for a long time. There’s a pile of mail at the door \nalmost two feet high, and today it was topped with a crisp brown envelope \naddressed to me, containing this statement. A gift from Elias, no doubt. \nHe could have sent this to me any time, filled me in on Breekon and Hope, but \nno. I had to find it myself, just in time for him to show me he knew all about it. \nCocky prick. \nStill, there’s not actually as much information here as I’d hoped, either here or \nin the statement. It shows that Breekon and Hope didn’t own the company, I \nguess. That those aren’t their real names. It does seem to confirm that they \nhave some connection to the Circus, judging by clandestine meetings with \nsomeone apparently dressed as a ringmaster – as if it’s not obvious if you’re \ndressed as a ringmaster! And their apparent Russian origins. I say ‘origins’, \nperhaps… perhaps it’s just the last link in a very long chain. If the Circus is \nconnected as closely to the Stranger and the Unknowing as I believe, I should \nprobably keep an eye out for delivery vans.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 2, "chunk_count": 5, "chars": 4059}}
