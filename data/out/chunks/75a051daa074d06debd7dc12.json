I was aware \nthat Major Tom wasn’t anywhere to be seen, which was odd, since he usually \ngot fed shortly after I arrived home and he was never one to miss a meal. Still, I \ndidn’t think of it, and turned on the television. I hadn’t turned the satellite box, \nso what showed at first was an empty blue screen. I reached to the other \nremote to turn it on, when I realised the blue screen wasn’t empty. There, sat \nupon it, black against the glowing background, was a spider. And not just any \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG016 – Arachnophobia \n7 \n \nspider, but I swear to you, and here’s where you march me out of your little \ninstitute as a time-wasting lunatic, but I swear that it was the same damn \nspider. \nIt was the same size, the same shape, the same thick, pulsing abdomen. But \nmore than that, I felt it. I felt it in that fear that hit me like I had been punched \nin the stomach, and I felt it in the way that the thing just sat there, unmoving, \nwaiting for me to kill it again. I was stuck to my chair, just watching this spider \nas it stood there on the screen of my television. I called for Major Tom, but \nthere was no response. \nGod knows how long I sat staring at the spider on my television. I don’t wear a \nwatch, and I couldn’t move my arm to check my phone. If I hadn’t been sat \ndown I would have run already, but standing up was more movement than I \ncould bring myself to make while it watched me. \nFinally, I got to my feet. It was less effort than I expected when I finally \nmustered the will to do it. Although that’s not really how it felt at the time – at \nthat point it felt almost involuntary, as though some something were lifting \nme, hoisting me to my feet by unseen strings. I began to walk, but rather than \nfleeing the spider I found I moved towards it, until I stopped there, so close I \ncould have touched it, though my mind recoils at the thought. Before I realised \nexactly what I was doing I lifted my leg, and kicked the television, instantly \ncrushing the bulbous spider beneath the heel of my shoe, and now I think \nabout it, narrowly avoiding a nasty electrocution. I had had no inkling I was \ncapable of such a thing, but once again the spider was dead, and I had a slimy \nstain on my shoe. \nI threw the shattered remains of the television away, burned the shoe and \ntried, desperately to return to something approaching my normal life, but it \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG016 – Arachnophobia \n8 \n \nwas no good. The spider that I had killed had come back, of that I had no \ndoubt, and a deep paranoia began to set in as I waited for it to return again. I \nsaw Major Tom only once in the weeks that followed. He came in, sniffed at \nthe bowl of food I had continued to put out for him in the vain hope of luring \nhim back, and turned around and walked away. As he left he gave me a look \nthat I could have sworn was one of pity. \nI called in sick to my job, as I wasn’t really sleeping and so much of the time \nwas spent checking nooks and corners for the spider, that I was a nervous \nwreck. More than once I did find spiders, but they weren’t the one who was \nafter me, so I killed them without a second thought. My life descended into the \nmess that it, well, it still remains today. \nI was right, though. Two weeks after I kicked it to death on my TV, there it was. \nOver my bed. Standing on the wall over the spot where my head lay each night \nas I tried in vain to sleep. It was that damned spider. And I recognised it. My \nbedroom is better lit than the kitchen, and it wasn’t silhouetted against a \nscreen, so for the first time I got a really good look at my tormentor, and I \nrealised that I had seen it before the kitchen. \nI was not born with a fear of spiders. In fact for the first six years of my life I \ncan only assume I existed in peaceful harmony with them. But that changed in \nthe autumn of 1991. I didn’t live in London then but with my parents in \nSouthampton, and we would visit my grandparents every Sunday, out in the \nnearby New Forest. They lived on the edge of a suburb, and from the bottom \nof my grandmother’s garden you could see fields stretching away for a half a \nmile to the tree line. I used to spend a lot of time down there, and if you were \nlucky, sometimes there would be horses..", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 4, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 4469}}
