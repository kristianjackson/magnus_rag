Episode sixty-two. First Edition. \n[Tape clicks on.] \nGERTRUDE \nWell? \nMARY \nNo need to rush me, Gertrude. I'm sure we've got all the time in the world. \nBesides, look at this dusty old thing; expect it needs time to warm up. You \ndon't use it much anymore, do you? \nGERTRUDE \nTea? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 062 – First Edition \n \n2 \n \nMARY \nGod, no, hate the stuff. \nGERTRUDE \nWhy are you here? \nMARY \nTo make my statement, of course. I know the Institute and me haven't always \nseen eye to eye, as it were, but I thought it was the least I could do. \nGERTRUDE \nWhy now? \nMARY \nWhy not? Big changes are coming, Gertrude, and I have to think about leaving \nsomething for posterity. \nGERTRUDE \nFine. Subject is Mary Keay, recorded 3rd July 2008. What is it regarding? \nMARY \nWhat a question. I wonder. Plenty to choose from, I suppose. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 062 – First Edition \n \n3 \n \nGERTRUDE \nHm, take your time. \nMARY \nDid I ever tell you about my first Leitner? Of course, this was before he was \ncollecting them, so back then it was just a strange book. Odd to think there \nwas a time before he'd stamped them with his mark. I feel we must have called \nthem something. Did we even know how many there were? Or did we just \nthink of each as a thing all its own? \nGERTRUDE \nI don't recall. \nMARY \nI met him a few times, you know. Must have been about 15 years ago, not long \nbefore his library burned down. He wasn't all that impressive, to be honest. \nShorter than I expected and slower somehow. I expected a whirlwind of \nintense energy, but he was gentle, methodical, perfectly pleasant to talk to. \nJurgen Leitner bored me. Whenever he came to look through my stock, he'd \nspend almost a full minute on each book, just staring at it, examining the \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 062 – First Edition \n \n4 \n \npages, and half the time leave without buying anything. Good riddance, if you \nask me. \nGERTRUDE \nI wouldn't know. I can't say we ever crossed paths. \nMARY \nI suppose not. You don't really go out and look for yourself, do you? Just wait \nhere for the researcher's leftovers. \nGERTRUDE \nHm, It's not that bad. Sometimes someone will insist on giving me a statement \ndirectly, though I rarely see the point. \nMARY \nMm, well, they don't understand up there. They don't know what this place is. \nYou do, though, don't you? We're on the same side really, even if Elias \ndisagrees. \nGERTRUDE \nIf you say so. I believe you were giving me an account of your first encounter \nwith one of the books? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 062 – First Edition \n \n5 \n \nMARY \nOf course. I was very young, but I still remember it clear as day. I was nine \nyears old at the time, so it would have been 1955. It was shortly after my idiot \nfather had gotten himself killed and my mother was still working for your \nInstitute. We were living in Whitechapel back then, just off Turner Street. It \nwasn't much, just a couple of rooms and a stove, but it was enough for us. \nMy mother worked long hours, as even back then, the Institute didn't pay their \nresearchers well, and she supplemented our meagre income by working late at \na factory on Globe Road. It made dressing gowns. Most of the time I was left to \nmy own devices. If she'd had any sense, my mother would have chucked your \nlot and gone to work at the factory full time. She would have earned a damn \nsight more. Still, she believed in the work and the one thing she was never \nneglectful of was what she called my ‘true studies’. I am grateful to her, of \ncourse. I just wish that she'd got over her slavish devotion to you and your \npatron. \nGERTRUDE \nYou make a lot of assumptions, Mary. And I thought we were supposed to be \non the same side? \nMARY", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 0, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 4117}}
