And let’s be honest for a second, you just want an excuse \nto stick a knife in Jonah Magnus. \nGEORGIE \nJohn! \nMELANIE \nNo, he’s got a point. I want that smug bastard dead, and if I got a chance to do \nit myself you can bet I would do it in a heartbeat. But if you think that’s all I \ncare about here, then frankly you can fuck off out my tunnels on your high \nhorse. \n(Beat) \n[Melanie’s folded cane gently clicks as she untenses] \nMARTIN \nI, I can’t just hang around, and watch the whole world linger like this on the \noff-chance that it might do some small good somewhere else. \nARCHIVIST \nMaybe it doesn’t have to linger. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 199 – Seeing it Through \n17 \nBASIRA \nYou want to think very hard about your next words. \nARCHIVIST \nI’m just saying... If I took my place in the Panopticon, I’d hoped I could make it \neasier for everyone, but… maybe I could just make it faster. Shuffle people \ntowards The End. Accelerate things. \n(Melanie shivers) \nGEORGIE \nWould The Eye even let you do that? \nARCHIVIST \nIt’s like Annabelle said, it doesn’t really do foresight. As long as it was fed I \ndoubt it would even know until it was too late. And The Web couldn’t touch \nme once I was in control. \nGEORGIE \nJohn, you’re talking about killing the whole world... \nARCHIVIST \n(Firm) You’re the one who wanted to cover every option. We need to admit \nthat ending it quickly might be a kindness. \nThe truth is any choice we make is going to lead to an atrocity of one sort or \nanother. At least this way we know the suffering ends. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 199 – Seeing it Through \n18 \nBASIRA \nNo! No, I’m not just gonna stand here, and watch you try to justify murdering \nhumanity. \nARCHIVIST \n(Angry) How is it different from just letting it happen on its own? \nBASIRA \n(Forceful) Because it is. It’s not an option. End of discussion. \nARCHIVIST \nBasira— \nMARTIN \nUh, I just can’t accept it’s really that hopeless. There’s got to be a chance that \nthese other universes will figure something out that we didn’t. \nMELANIE \nThey’ll have as much of a chance as we did. More, maybe. The Fears had a long \ntime to get a foothold in our world. \nARCHIVIST \nAssuming time even works the same in different dimensions. \n(Melanie sighs) \nGEORGIE \nWe’ve got to hope. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 199 – Seeing it Through \n19 \nARCHIVIST \nHope that our actions don’t destroy countless other worlds! \nGEORGIE \n(Snapping) It’s better than the certainty that they’ll destroy this one! \n(Beat) \nARCHIVIST \nSounds like you’ve all decided, then. \nBASIRA \nSeems that way. \nGEORGIE \nShall we vote on it, or something? \nARCHIVIST \n(Miffed) No need. Seems pretty much unanimous at this point. We take out \nthe Panopticon, and just hope for the best. \nMARTIN \nYeah. \nARCHIVIST \nFine. I’m going for a cigarette. \n[Footsteps as the Archivist heads for the door] \n[Tape clicks off] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 199 – Seeing it Through \n20 \n[Tape clicks on] \n[The ambience of the vast tower steps: cameras iris movements \nand faint whispers are audible; a faint pulsing tone permeates the \nbackground; and distant muffled helicopter and drone sounds] \n[Climbing footsteps] \n[The Archivist takes a drag on a cigarette, then exhales] \nGEORGIE \nYou do know there’s an indoor smoking ban right? \nARCHIVIST \nThey’ll make an exception for me. \n(Faint chuckle from Georgie) \nBesides, I can’t really think down there. \n(Sighing) That’s not true, I can. It’s just... exhausting. Puts me in a foul mood. \nIt’s better up here, close to The Eye. Thoughts come quicker. \nGEORGIE \nIf it’s any consolation, you seemed pretty on the ball earlier. \nARCHIVIST \nIt isn’t really, but… thank you. \n[Georgie sits down] \nGEORGIE \nCan I have a cigarette? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 199 – Seeing it Through \n21 \n(The Archivist makes a quiet chuckle) \n[The Archivist offers the cigarette packet to Georgie, who then \ndispenses one for herself] \nARCHIVIST \nHmm. Sure. I thought you quit? \nGEORGIE \nI did, for my health. But it’s already the apocalypse so… I’ll need a light too. \nARCHIVIST \nYeah. \n[Lighter snicks open] \n[Georgie lights up] \nGEORGIE \nI tried to avoid it in the tunnels when we had our, um... When the others were \nhere. \nNice lighter. \nARCHIVIST \nHmm? \n[The faintest amount of hissing static starts and ends] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nYou didn’t want to tarnish the image of the prophets?", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 3, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 4431}}
