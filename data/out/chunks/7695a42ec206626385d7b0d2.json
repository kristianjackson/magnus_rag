They resist all attempts to \nmeasure and expose them, visible only in their effect upon the world, their \nnature guessed at, seeping through the holes in our knowledge of the cosmos. \nAll of those things that are believed to be existence – matter, energy, radiation \n– all of them are utterly dwarfed by their dark counterparts. Which leads to an \ninevitable question: if the fundamental building blocks are so predominantly \nthe dark parts, is it not the light-twisted versions of them that are the \ndeviation, the pale reflection? Perhaps it should be matter and light matter. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 135 – Dark Matter \n \n5 \n \nBut I did not come here to quibble over semantics. I came to tell you my story, \nthough it has perhaps become my sermon. No matter. These thoughts, these \nfeelings, were always in my mind, and my work in physics only served to \ndeepen them. But it was not until I met Maxwell Raynor that I realised the \ndeeper truth of it all. He spoke words I thought existed only in my heart, and I \nloved him as the soil loves the rain. At first, I thought his blindness was a gift, \nbut he rebuked me for such thoughts. Simply because one cannot feel the \nheat, he told me, does not mean their flesh does not burn. The light is more \nthan simply the source of sight; it is the source of our entire venal half-\nexistence, and he was aware of it always. \nMaxwell told me it is in our nature to fear the dark, and I could not disagree. \nFor all my intellectual reverence of it, I could not deny that on those few \noccasions I had found myself in full and proper darkness, my heart had \ntrembled. And rightly so, he said, for are we not creatures born of the light, \ncontemptible and corrupt? Surely then, this fear of confronting the pure \nnature of the universe is right and good. Surely this fear of the dark is the \ntruest communion that humanity could ever hope for. And at his words, I felt \nafraid, and my heart soared in terror and elation as my eyes brimmed with \ntears, for I knew he spoke the truth. \nSo, we began to work together, to worship together in his church, the only \nchurch I’ve ever felt I truly belonged to. It was wonderful. And when he spoke \nto me of prophecy, of the movement of the heavens and the killing of the sun, \nI knew I would do everything in my power to help him. And I could, more than \nanyone else on Earth, he said, because of my expertise. That knowledge I had \ngained in defiance of the dark could finally be put to use. I was to create a \nfocus, a black star, a new centre point around which a universe of purest \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 135 – Dark Matter \n \n6 \n \ndarkness could turn. To take dark matter, dark energy, and harness it, bring it \nforward into a form that could be held, used ... worshipped. \nScientifically, it was nonsense, of course. Dark energy and the light don’t work \nlike that, not even remotely, but that wasn’t important. What mattered was \nthat it felt like science, and that was all I needed. To do my work, to create the \nblack star, would need a parody, an aping mockery of science. But it would also \nneed the deepest of darknesses. When I told Maxwell what I actually needed, \nhe told me such a thing was impossible, but I insisted. And so, he began his \nown work on the Daedalus. \nI don’t know how he convinced Fairchild and the Lukases to help finance the \nproject. A life as long as his is evidently very good for one’s finances, but even \nso, space exploration is a whole other magnitude of expenditure. I don’t \nentirely know if they were working on rituals of their own, or simply pushing \nthe boundaries of their own fears, their masters. Either way, it was clear my \ntwo fellow astronauts were patsies, sent up there to suffer. I almost felt bad \nfor them, but it was in most ways a relief, to know I wouldn’t need to worry \nabout them interfering with my own project. \nExactly how the launch was arranged, I couldn’t tell you, but I assume the \ncalculations must have been done by one of ours. Otherwise, well, weight is \nvery important when planning a launch, and it could hardly have escaped their \nnotice that there were four people in that rocket: three astronauts and one \nunlucky nyctophobe, sealed in a lightless box, silenced but not sedated, \napparently indistinguishable from the rest of the supplies.
