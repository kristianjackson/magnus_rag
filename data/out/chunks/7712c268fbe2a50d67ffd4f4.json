Perhaps... love? \n[Sounds of getting up and walking] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nYes, perhaps now, without the wrinkled threat that chuckled from his armchair \nat any thought of his happiness, perhaps now he could find someone to spend \nhis life with. \n[Old computer button noise, crackling monitor, then mouse an \nkeyboard use] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nMalcolm fired up his old computer, which groaned to life with a sputter, the \nmonitor cracked and broken, and the keyboard stiff to the touch. For a \nterrifying moment it seemed as though it might not work at all, but finally the \nscreen lit up in a dull, sickly green. Malcolm clicked through until he found \nwhat he was looking for. A dating site. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 194 – Parting \n \n13 \nThe name of the website was distorted beyond recognition, but he seemed to \nstill be logged in from all those years ago, and he began to click through \nprofiles. Mary, she seemed nice, but somehow too long. Jenny seemed to have \na good sense of humour, but… half of her was backwards. Hannah didn’t seem \nto have anything wrong with her at first glance, but her profile smelt of rotten \nmeat. Then he found Antonia, and he gasped. Her smile was so wide and so \nopen that all at once he felt a wave of warm infatuation pass down and over \nhis body, permeating everywhere... Except for his right shoulder, which \nremained ice cold. \n[Fabric movement sounds] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nSomething was wrong. Malcolm moved his fingers across and over the area, \nfeeling the space between his neck and arm. There was a lump there. Hard and \nround and smooth to the touch. He pressed it gently, and winced as pain \nradiated through him. Gingerly, he unbuttoned his shirt, sliding the rough \nfabric down his torso, and examined the shining protrusion. Some sort of \ncallous, maybe? A tumour? Malcolm’s mind began running frantically through \nall the worst-case possibilities. And then, it opened. \n[Fleshy wet sound of opening] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nThe iris was dull grey, surrounded by yellowed, bloodshot tissue, and the pupil \nwas dull, almost cloudy, but the eye that stared out from his shoulder seemed \nto focus well enough. \n[Watery sounds of vitreous sans humour] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 194 – Parting \n \n14 \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nIt swivelled wildly, looking all around the room as Malcolm desperately tried to \nhold back a scream. Then it settled on the dull glow of the computer monitor. \nOn Antonia. And the icy shock of bitter disapproval shot through his veins like \nlightning. His hand lunged out almost on reflex, snatching the power cable \nfrom the computer and pulling it free. \n[Sounds of computer cables sliding and monitor turning off; watery \neye sounds continue] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nThe screen went dark with a small pop, and Malcolm was left sitting there, \nshaking. The eye turned once towards his pale and terrified face, then closed in \nsatisfaction. \n[A sliding door opens and the sounds transition to that of a \nwaiting room with a distant phone ringing] \n[Footsteps, then sounds of sitting down] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nThe waiting room was almost empty when he got to Accident & Emergency. \nThe nurse sat at the desk gave him a weird look and told him to take a seat. He \ntried to settle down on one of the smooth, orange chairs, bolted to a long iron \nbar to form a crude bench, but he couldn’t get comfortable. From underneath \nhis coat, he could hear it; the tiny, whispering mouth that had opened up on \nthe long Tube-ride over. \n[Wet eye noises restart along with a strange, muffled internal \nbody sound]", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 3, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 3573}}
