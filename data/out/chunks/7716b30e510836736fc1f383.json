God \nknows what would’ve happened if that little prick Sebastian hadn’t given me \nthat book. \nI didn’t know what it was at first, not really. But it talked to me about bones \nand flesh and muscle and blood; the bits of myself I actually knew and liked. So \nI listened, and I read, and I learned. I fumbled through the lessons the book \nwanted to teach me, and my first try was clumsy. Stupid. Turns out, Dad didn’t \nlike being tall nearly as much as he thought he would. And Mum didn’t like her \nnew smile, either. So I left. \nI wandered around for a bit. Worked a lotta jobs where it didn’t matter what \nyou looked like. There’s always a spot for someone who can get rid of people. \n\nYou must have heard about me. I left plenty of people scared and crying, \nitching to tell someone what happened to ‘em. Some of them must have made \nit to you. \nThere were others. Others of skin and hunger; they tried to talk to me about \ngods. They’d go on and on about remaking the world; of a new day of blood \nand flesh. I told them to piss off. I like the world just as it is. I take what I want \nand I make myself more, and when people look at me… that fear – it feels \namazing. Some of my mates, the ones I helped find their proper bodies, they \nlistened, and went to feed the hunger. Not me though. I never was that \nambitious. \nThe letters started comin’ in about two years ago. Good white paper, large \nprint. Nice and simple. Dunno who sent them, they were never signed, and I \ndunno how they kept finding me. There was never much in them; normally just \na name and a place or a time. I ignored the first couple, but they kept coming, \nand eventually I got curious. So, I followed the instructions in one of ‘em. I \nfound Regan Hasnain of 70 Clairmont Gardens, and that got rid of most of my \ndoubts. \nI don’t blame people for thinking that all bones are the same, most people \ndon’t have much experience, but it’s not true. There are good bones, and there \nare bad bones, and Regan Hasnain had some very good bones in her. They \nwere solid, healthy, and they jumped at my touch. I didn’t doubt the letters \nagain. \nThey came pretty regular after that. And they always led to summat good. \nQuality bones, a new mate, or some unlucky fool who wouldn’t look at me for \nthe fear. It got so I trusted them. The letters, I mean. So I didn’t question them. \n\nThere’s a lotta stuff in this world I’ve never understood, and these were no \ndifferent. Then I got one about your lot, your Archives. Told me to go there and \nkill you. They even sent a picture. \nSo I did. Well, I tried. Didn’t know about those tunnels or wherever this place \nis, but the pipes… they were wide enough for me and a few friends to squeeze \nthrough, bit by bit, one bone at a time. \n[Demonstrative cracking accompanies this] \nJARED (Cont.) \nWhen we came up through the floor, it was wonderful. I don’t think I’ll ever \nforget the look on their faces. It was like their world had gone with the floor. \nThe weak one legged it, and I thought the skinny one did too. There was just \nthe copper. It weren’t dressed like one, but I know police when I smell it. They \ntried to run, but we were everywhere, and they couldn’t stop us undoing them \nfor parts. You weren’t there, which was sad, but it made it easier. \nAt least until the knife. I don’t know what the skinny one did, what she was, \nbut that knife hurt. \nShe screamed, and stabbed, and cut through all the others, ruining their \nperfect bodies. Then, she turned on me. Reached out with some of my hands, \nto get inside her, and pull her apart, and she cut them off. I got... scared. So I \nran. I ran through the first door I found. And now I don’t know where I am. \nI’m startin’ to think the letters were a trap. Was it you? Did you want me here? \n‘Coz if so, well played. Mind you, lot of trouble to go through just to lose a rib, \nso maybe not. \n\nThat’s it, then. \nDo you want to do this, or what? \nARCHIVIST \nThat’s it? (He snorts) Hardly worth a rib. \n[Jared looms forward] \nARCHIVIST (Cont.) \n(Placatingly) Alright! Alright. Is it, uh… Is is going to hurt? \nJARED \nDunno. Doesn't hurt me. \n(The Archivist makes noises of pain.) \n[Extended sounds of meat and bone movement] \nJARED (Cont.) \nThat’s yours. What’s it for? \n(The Archivist keeps making pained noises) \nARCHIVIST \n(Stumblingly) Um… A, A-An anchor \nJARED \nHuh. Right. Anyway, this one’s for me. \n[More mobile meat noises, this time of insertion]", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 3, "chunk_count": 5, "chars": 4444}}
