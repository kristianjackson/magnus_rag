The Magnus Archives. Episode one hundred and fifty-\nnine: \"The Last.\" \n[Theme finishes] \n[Tape clicks on] \n[Waves break on the shores of a windswept nowhere] \n[Faint continuous sound of the Lonely (Peter’s) static] \n[The Archivist walks, gravel crunching under his feet] \nARCHIVIST \n(Calling) Martin! \n(Calling) Martin! \n[Peter Lukas isn’t there] \n(Peter’s voice slowly shifts from side to side, trailing echoes) \n \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 159 – The Last \n \n2 \nPETER \nHe doesn’t want to see you. \n[The Archivist stops walking] \nARCHIVIST \nWhere are you? \nPETER \nI’m not here, Archivist. No-one is. It’s only you. \nARCHIVIST \nFine. Then maybe no-one can answer some questions. \nPETER \nYou’ve still got time, Archivist. Turn around and leave. You’ve played your part. \nNow go. \nARCHIVIST \nWhat’s wrong Lukas? Afraid of talking face to face? \n(Peter chuckles) \nPETER \nOf course. Or haven’t you been paying attention. \n(The Archivist makes an angry noise) \n[The Archivist restarts walking] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 159 – The Last \n \n3 \nARCHIVIST \n(Calling) Martin! \nPETER \nIt’s odd, really. You each think you’re so focused on the other. But how much \ndo you really know each other? How much time have you spent together when \nnot working, or bickering, or fleeing from that latest thing that wants to kill \nyou? So what are you seeking? The image you’ve each created of the other? \nThe people you think you love don’t exist, not really. And that’s a very lonely \nplace to be. \nARCHIVIST \n(Vicious) Shut up. (calling) Martin! \n[The Archivist stops walking] \nPETER \nHe doesn’t want to see you. \nARCHIVIST \nThen let me hear that from him. \nPETER \nJust go. \nARCHIVIST \n(Mean) Make me. (considering) Unless you can’t. The Lonely and the Eye \naren’t too far apart, are they? Not really. What good’s being alone if you don’t \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 159 – The Last \n \n4 \nknow how alone you truly are. Which means... Well, I think you’re worried. You \nknow I’ll find him eventually and you know I can find you. \n(Beat) \nHm. Thought so. \n[The Archivist restarts walking then stops] \n[Martin is there] \n(Martin’s voice slowly shifts from side to side, trailing echoes) \nARCHIVIST \nMartin. \nMARTIN \n(Flat) John? \nARCHIVIST \nI-I’m here. I-I came for you. \nMARTIN \nWhy? \nARCHIVIST \n…I thought you might be lost. \nMARTIN \nAre you real? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 159 – The Last \n \n5 \nARCHIVIST \nYes! Yes, I-I, I am. C-come on, we’ve got to get out of here. \nMARTIN \nN-no... No, I don’t think so. \nARCHIVIST \nWhy? \nMARTIN \nThis is where I should be. \nIt feels right. \nARCHIVIST \nMartin don’t say that. \nMARTIN \nNothing hurts here. It’s just quiet. Even the fear is gentle here. \nARCHIVIST \n(Concerned) This isn’t right — this isn’t you. \nMARTIN \nIt is, though. I really loved you, you know? \nARCHIVIST \nMartin, listen, he-he’s done something, Peter’s done something to mess with \nyour— \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 159 – The Last \n \n6 \n[Martin is no longer there] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nDammit! (Calling) Martin? Martin! \n[The Archivist restarts walking] \n[Peter is not there] \n(Peter’s voice slowly shifts from side to side, trailing echoes) \nPETER \nI tried to tell you. He’s gone. He made his choice. And it wasn’t you. \nARCHIVIST \nIt was for me, though. I’m the reason he— I did this to him as much as you. \nPETER \nYes. I suppose you did. \nWhere are your friends, Archivist? \nARCHIVIST \nTim and Sasha are dead. \nPETER \nYes? \nARCHIVIST \nDaisy and Basira are, probably dead. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 159 – The Last \n \n7 \nPETER \nBecause. Of. You. \nARCHIVIST \nGeorgie and Melanie have left me. \nPETER \nAnd? \nARCHIVIST \nMartin’s gone. \nPETER \nYou’re alone, Archivist. The last one standing. I did warn you. I did want you to \nleave but, perhaps it would be better if you stayed awhile. After all, you can’t \nhurt anyone in here. \nARCHIVIST \n…Yes… \nPETER \nYes. \n[The Archivist stops walking] \n(Beat) \n[Peter is there] \n[Hissing static starts]", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 0, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 4165}}
