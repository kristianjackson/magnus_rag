The Magnus Archives. Episode one hundred and sixty-\nnine: \"Fire Escape.\" \n[Theme finishes] \n[Tape clicks on] \n[In the distance, a building is ablaze; parts of the building regularly \ncollapse, people scream] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 169 – Fire Escape \n2 \nARCHIVIST \nMartin? Still with me? \nMARTIN \n(Shaky) Y-Y-Ye-Yeah, Yeah. Jus… Oh, Jesus! \nARCHIVIST \nSome fears don't need to be intensified. Only manifested. \nMARTIN \nAre we even going to be able to make it through all that? \n[Distant sounds of part of the building collapsing] \nARCHIVIST \nIt's a maze in there, deliberately so. People running, desperately struggling for \nfire escapes only to find them blocked. We won't get lost, though. I know the \nroute. \nMARTIN \nThat's... not really what I was getting at, John. \nARCHIVIST \nGo on. \nMARTIN \nSeriously? You don't— (pointed) It's on fire, John; it's— \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 169 – Fire Escape \n3 \nARCHIVIST \nMm— \nMARTIN \n—it's a burning. Building! \nARCHIVIST \nYes it is. \nMARTIN \nThat's on fire! \nARCHIVIST \nYes. \nMARTIN \nRight. You are aware that traditionally, wading into a flaming inferno is actually \nconsidered bad for your health! \nARCHIVIST \n(Slight annoyance) Yes, Martin. It'll be fine. \nMARTIN \nAlright, I just wanted to check. So. Okay. (nervous) We're planning to go \nthrough... all this, so I'm guessing the fire can't actually burn us! Right? John? \nARCHIVIST \nUm… \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 169 – Fire Escape \n4 \nMARTIN \nJohn? \nARCHIVIST \nUm... mm— \nMARTIN \nJohn. \nARCHIVIST \nI-It's complicated. \nMARTIN \nWell, if you want me to go in there with you, then I suggest you find a way to \nmake it simple! (firm) Yes or no, can that fire hurt us? \nARCHIVIST \nDefine ‘hurt’. \nMARTIN \n(Firm) Will the fire feel hot to me? \nARCHIVIST \nYes. \nMARTIN \nWill it cause me lots of pain if I touch it? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 169 – Fire Escape \n5 \nARCHIVIST \nYes, though not as much as— \nMARTIN \n(Distressed) Will it burn me alive and kill me dead? \nARCHIVIST \nNo. It can't do us any permanent harm, once we're out, we'll be fine. \nMARTIN \n(Quavering) You are aware that intense pain can do you loads of harm, even if \nthere's no, you know, physical injury— \nARCHIVIST \n(Snapping) Yes, I know, okay! (sigh) I'll take us through the parts that are \nmore... subdued. \n[Distant sounds of part of the building collapsing] \n(Martin takes a breath to start to say something) \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nIt goes in phases; sometimes there are whole apartments that aren't actively \non fire for... hours! \nMARTIN \n(Flat) How reassuring. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 169 – Fire Escape \n6 \nARCHIVIST \nWell, it's the best I can do! \nMARTIN \nYou're sure there isn't another way? \n(Martin sighs) \n(Beat) \nYeah, yeah I know, the journey will be the journey, blah blah ominous blah. \nARCHIVIST \nI'm sorry. \nMARTIN \nIt's fine. I know you wouldn't take us through if we didn't actually need to go \nthrough, so... \n(Beat) \nWhat? \nARCHIVIST \nWell… \nMARTIN \nJohn, is there another way? \nARCHIVIST \nI mean— sort of? Maybe? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 169 – Fire Escape \n7 \nMARTIN \nThat turn. You-you took a hard turn after the roots back there; I knew that was \na thing! Why are we here? \nARCHIVIST \nIt's just, when you said— \nMARTIN \n(Firm) John, why have you taken us here? \nARCHIVIST \nJude Perry. \nThis is where Jude Perry rules. \n(Beat) \nMARTIN \nThat's the one who burned your hand, isn't it? \nARCHIVIST \nYes. \nMARTIN \nRight. I just assumed this would be... who was that landlord guy? \nARCHIVIST \nArthur Nolan. He's here; he has a part of it, but it's... huge. Bigger than you \ncould believe. There's so much fear in there.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 0, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 4113}}
