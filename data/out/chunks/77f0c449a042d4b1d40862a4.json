All that is \nrequired is a little bit of willpower. \n[More rope creaks] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nYou have a little bit of willpower, don't you? \nFrancis begins to cry. They turn back towards the wings, keen to make their \nexit, but where they stood a moment before, there is now a dangling hook. \n[The sound of whipping rope that ends with stabbing flesh] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nIt lunges at Francis, digging into their leg, pushing through the flesh of their \nthigh. There is a thin trickle of blood. There is a thick shot of pain. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 172 – Strung Out \n5 \nFRANCIS’ FATHER, offstage: Useless piece of shit. You need to grow up! \n[The audience laughs] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nPause for laughter. \n[The laughter ends with some clapping] \n[Sounds of hops and rope creaks] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nThe hook lifts Francis’ leg off the ground. They hop painfully, trying to escape, \nbut the thread pulls tight, dragging them towards the table. \nTHE SPIDER, offstage: What a funny little dance, Francis. Such a funny dance. \nFrancis simply screams in response. It is a scream of anger as much as it is of \npain, and it cannot hide the dreadful inevitability they feel. The dull terror that \nthis act will end like all the others. \nIn their thrashing jig they stumble into another hanging hook. \n[The sound of whipping rope that ends with stabbing flesh] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nIt burrows into their wrist with a noise of triumph. \nFRANCIS’ MOTHER, offstage: I just worry about you, dear; that's all. We want \nwhat's best for you, even if you can't see it. I'm sure you'll grow out of it. \nBetween the two silk strings, Francis dangles, eyes darting wildly about. \nFRANCIS: Why are you doing this? \nThe Spider’s giggle echoes around the stage. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 172 – Strung Out \n6 \n[A chitinous laughing sound] \n[The audience laughs] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nPause for laughter. \n[Laughter ends] \n[Rope creaks] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nThe Spider twists the string, alternating which of the two lines is taut, causing \nFrancis to whirl and pivot towards the table. Its bulbous, distended abdomen \ncan now begin to be seen protruding from above the curtains that fringe the \nstage. Francis goes limp, briefly allowing The Spider to guide their movements \nsmoothly. \nTHE SPIDER: Good, Francis. Good. \nWithout warning, Francis kicks their free leg against the table. It does not \nmove. It is part of the tableau. \n[Kick and sounds of stagger] \n[The sound of whipping rope that ends with stabbing flesh] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nThe force of the motion sends them staggering backwards; another hook \nbrushes past their cheek and takes its chance, ripping through the corner of \ntheir mouth and pulling it up into a grimace. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 172 – Strung Out \n7 \nRYAN, A FRIEND, offstage: You never smile when you're clean, did you know \nthat? I mean, what have you got to be so sad about? Honestly. You do make it \nhard sometimes. I don't know. \nFrancis tries to respond, but the hook in their mouth pulls tight, and their lips \ncurve upwards, distorting the words. \nFRANCIS: Shut up! \n[The audience laughs] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nPause for laughter. \n[Laughter stops with a few clapped hands] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nFrancis tries to use their free hand to pull the razored metal barb from their \nmouth, but The Spider reaches down a leg and pulls, hoisting its victim up by \ntheir face. \nThe agonizing motion is too sudden to even give them time to scream, and \ntheir free leg kicks out, impotently into the air. \nIt hits against another hook— \n[The sound of whipping rope that ends with stabbing flesh] \n[Rope creaks] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \n—which penetrates their worn and weary boots with ease, digging up through \nthe sole and out through the back of the ankle.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 1, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 3941}}
