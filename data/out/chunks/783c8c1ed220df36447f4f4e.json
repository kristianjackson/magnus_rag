I still don’t, really. \nI don’t know what to think. Greg’s my best friend, but I might have to stop \nseeing him. He’s still working on that site, still updating the domain name, still \npasting gibberish into the code. I think he might be a part of something really \nawful, and I don’t know how to make him see that. If I had a little bit more \ncourage, I might just hang around a few message boards I know, waiting for a \nlink to The Chelicerae, waiting to post a name that might end it. I’ve got a story \nfor it, alright. \nBut I won’t. I’m just too much of a coward, I suppose, so I guess I’m telling it to \nyou instead. For all the good that’ll do. \nARCHIVIST \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 123 - Web Development \n18 \n \nStatement ends. \nThe Web does seem to have a preference for those who prefer not to assert \nthemselves. The investigation is tricky. I don’t want to impose on Basira, and \nobviously Melanie and… Martin aren’t available, but I did do some light \nsearching myself on Gregory Cox. Vanished, unsurprisingly, sometime in late \nJuly 2016, which is... two years ago. \nThat doesn’t seem right. It doesn’t feel like— There’s just this great gap of time \nwhere I wasn’t. No notes or follow-up here that I can see, just— It looks like \nthe statement came in just after Gertrude ‘disappeared’. Another gap, and \nwhoever took it didn’t do any follow-up, just filed it away. I may be the first \nperson to actually read it, so... sorry Angie, I suppose. \nThere’s a small supplemental document with it, though, that is a bit alarming. \nIt’s apparently a list of people whose names appeared in the various pieces of \ntext Mr Cox was pasting into the code. It’s unclear if they were meant to be \nusers or victims, but I cannot help but note that there seem to be the names of \nseveral statement givers who found their way to the Institute, including noted \narachnophobe Carlos Vittery. Perhaps a coincidence, just people shopping \ntheir traumatic event around? But I have to wonder how much their actions \nwere their own. \nI have no theories on this, no, no sudden insights. I wish I could talk it through \nwith Martin. Or Tim. Or Sasha. Though we never really did that, did we? \nEverything’s changed. \n(Sighs) Two days out of a coma, and I’m already tired. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 123 - Web Development \n19 \n \nEnd recording. \n[Tape clicks off] \n[The Magnus Archives Theme – Outro] \nThe Magnus Archives is a podcast distributed by Rusty Quill and licensed under \na Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Sharealike 4.0 International \nlicence. \nToday’s episode was written by Jonathan Sims and directed by Alexander J \nNewall. \nIt featured: Jonathan Sims as the Archivist, Frank Voss as Basira Hussain, and \nLydia Nicholas as Melanie King.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 5, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 2778}}
