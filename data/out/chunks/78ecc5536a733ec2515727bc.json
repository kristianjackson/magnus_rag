I do like this one! \n[Puts his drink down] \nMIKAELE (CONT’D) \nNow you mention it, you actually remind me of Jurgen a bit. In his younger \ndays of course. You’re sure you won’t have a drink? We definitely had some \ntea around here somewhere… \nMARTIN \nEr, I, I already had some, thank you. Some of us know how to be polite guests. \nARCHIVIST \n(Sharply) I don’t intend to accept anything offered by Annabelle Cane. \nMIKAELE \nOh, you know Annabelle? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 181 – Ignorance \n7 \nARCHIVIST \nSort of. You do know she’s part of The Web? \nMIKAELE \n(Sarcastically) No, I assumed the thread holding her head together was due to \na childhood knitting accident. \n(Chuckles) Of course I know she’s with The Web. \nARCHIVIST \nAnd that doesn’t bother you? \nMIKAELE \nNot especially. And even if it did, what good would it do? \nMARTIN \nSo what’s the deal with you two anyway? \nMIKAELE \nIt’s an odd situation, but not a complicated one. Shortly after I decided to stay \nhere, she arrived — wandered in from the chaos out there, and told me she \nwas going to stay with me. I didn’t get this far by pitting myself against The \nWeb, so I welcomed her in. \nARCHIVIST \nAnd...? \nMIKAELE \nAnd sometimes she cooks. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 181 – Ignorance \n8 \nARCHIVIST \nShe ‘cooks’? \nMIKAELE \nI don’t know what you want me to say. It’s a big house and I don’t see her \nmuch. Can’t even say which corner she’s made her nest in. Whatever she’s \ndoing, all I can do is hope it doesn't wreck my little oasis. And if it does then I \nhope that by keeping her in good graces she’ll at least do me the courtesy of \nkilling me first. \n(Discomforted noise from Martin) \nAnyway, let us talk of happier things. Or perhaps just take a moment to enjoy \nnot being out there. You are, of course, welcome to stay as long as you like. \nMARTIN \nAh- That’s… very generous. \nARCHIVIST \nWhat is this place — how did you find it? \nMIKAELE \n(Slightly curt) I didn’t find anything. I made it. \nARCHIVIST \n(Compellingly) Tell me what happened. \nMIKAELE \nNo. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 181 – Ignorance \n9 \nARCHIVIST \nI- uh... W-What? \n(Deep chuckles from Salesa) \nMIKAELE \n(Laughing) The look on your face! Look, he’s so confused! \n(Martin laughs a bit too) \nARCHIVIST \nMartin! \nMARTIN \n(Laughing) Sorry. Sorry. Y-You did look kind of funny. It was l-l-l-like you were \nflunking an exam or something. \n(More chuckling from Salesa) \nMIKAELE \nYes! Exactly that! Your powers won’t work here, Jonathan Sims, Head Archivist \nof the Magnus Institute, London. The Eye can’t see this place. \nARCHIVIST \nSo what now? \nMIKAELE \nAh, no need for the suspicion, I’m not going to hurt you. You’re quite safe. I’ll \ntell you soon enough. Like I said, I have no secrets. But it will be in my own \ntime. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 181 – Ignorance \n10 \nARCHIVIST \nRight. \nMIKAELE \nYou know, Gertrude once used that little trick to ask if I was trying to sell her a \nforgery. Admittedly I was, so I don’t hold a grudge, but I didn’t much care for \nthe experience. Anyway, for now, just relax, and no doubt I’ll get there \neventually — I haven’t had anyone to talk to properly in months. \nMARTIN \nI thought… what about Annabelle? \nMIKAELE \nShe keeps mostly to herself, and when she does talk, it’s usually more of the \nsinister monologue variety or cryptically telling me I’ve got ‘guests’. \nMARTIN \n(Crosstalk with ‘variety’) Ah. \nEr, yeah, that sounds familiar. \nARCHIVIST \nI’m trying to be less cryptic. \nMARTIN \nI-I know, I know.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 1, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 3738}}
