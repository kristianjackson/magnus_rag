We didn’t kill \nGertrude and no one wants to kill you, you pompous idiot! \n[Fist banging on table] \nARCHIVIST \nNow listen here, Tim... \nTIM \nNo! No, you listen for once. I was fine in research. Happy. Then you ask me to \nbe transferred here and suddenly it’s all monsters and killers and secret \npassages, oh my! And the worst thing, the actual worst thing, is that no one \nhere has my back. With any of it. Elias doesn’t care, Martin just wants a tea \nparty and Sasha... uh, and you, you’re treating me like I’m somehow to blame \nfor it all, like I didn’t suffer the worst, right alongside you. \nARCHIVIST \nWell excuse me if my experiences have made me– \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 065 – Binary \n17 \n \nTIM \nYour experiences? Fuck you! I got eaten by worms because of you. \nARCHIVIST \nWell, what do you want? You want sympathy? \nTIM \nYou know what, yeah! A little bit of basic sympathy would have been nice. \nARCHIVIST \nJane Prentiss was not my fault. I did not bring her to the Archives. \nTIM \nOh, but you went off the deep end afterwards, didn’t you? Everything went to \nhell and when you actually needed to be in charge, you just hid down here and \nplayed with your tape recorder. \nARCHIVIST \nWell, what would you have me do? \nTIM \nAnything! Anything that wasn’t turning into a paranoid lunatic would have \nbeen fine, anything that showed you could actually do your job. \nARCHIVIST \nWell, Elias clearly thinks that– \nTIM \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 065 – Binary \n18 \n \nElias should have fired you weeks ago. \nARCHIVIST \nWhat? \nTIM \nAfter everything you’ve pulled, you should be gone. But no, instead we all get \nto talk about how you’re feeling, because we’re worried about our stalker \nboss. I... I... I can’t do this anymore. \nARCHIVIST \nThen quit. (Pause) \nIf you hate it so much, leave your post in the Archives. Permanently. \nTIM \nAre you firing me? \nARCHIVIST \nI’m offering you a chance to quit. No notice period. I’ll even make sure you get \nthe rest of the month’s pay cheque. Just say the words. \nTIM \n(Sighs) I want to. \nARCHIVIST \nSo, do it. \n[Static rises] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 065 – Binary \n19 \n \nTIM \nI... can’t. \nARCHIVIST \nWhy not? \nTIM \nI... I... I can’t. I don’t know. Why can’t I quit? \nARCHIVIST \nI don’t know, but I don’t think I can fire you either. \nTIM \nWhat? \nARCHIVIST \nIt’s this place. \nTIM \nI don’t understand. \nARCHIVIST \nNeither do I. I’m trying to figure it out. I, I’ve got the shape of it, but... I’m \nsorry, Tim. Truly I am. But I cannot and will not trust you. This place isn’t right. \nYou see that now. I don’t know how or why, but there is something very wrong \nwith the Archives. And I don’t know who here is a victim of it and who is an \nagent. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 065 – Binary \n20 \n \n(Pause) \nTIM \nSo... what do we do? \nARCHIVIST \nFor now, I suppose we just... do our jobs. \nTIM \nI don’t want to. \nARCHIVIST \nNo, no. \nTIM \nI, uh, suppose I’ll see you later. \nARCHIVIST \nI suppose so. \n[Door closes] \nARCHIVIST \nEnd supplemental. \n[Tape clicks off.]", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 7, "chunk_count": 9, "chars": 3066}}
