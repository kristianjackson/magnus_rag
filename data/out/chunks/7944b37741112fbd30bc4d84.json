Perhaps I do have some pity for you. After all, I know \nyou, Trevor, you've had a tough life. Hardship from beginning to, huh, this \nstrange and twisted end. \nTREVOR \nNever complained. \nARCHIVIST \nNo. You haven't, have you? And maybe that's the greatest tragedy of all this. \nI'm sorry, Trevor. \n(Trevor's breathing goes from calmed to fast and heavy) \nTREVOR \n(Aggitated) For what? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 176 – Blood Ties \n21 \nARCHIVIST \nFor putting us all in this situation. I had hoped you'd go for me, but, well. I'm \nsorry I've reduced you lower even than prey. \nMARTIN \nJohn?... \nTREVOR \n(Snorts) No! \nARCHIVIST \n(Dark) To bait. \nMARTIN \n(Fast breathing) Don't- \n[Gunshot rings out] \n[As Trevor falls, the knife clatters to the ground] \n(Martin whimpers) \nMARTIN (CONT'D) \n(High) Oh-hoh. Hoh. Christ, you just, He jus— \nARCHIVIST \nRelax, Martin. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 176 – Blood Ties \n22 \nMARTIN \n(High) I’m I’m I'm not gonna, I'm not gonna relax; I'm sick of never knowing \nwhat's going on, and then, eh— \n[As he speaks, footsteps come through the bushes] \nARCHIVIST \nHello, Basira. \nMARTIN \nI- E- (some stutters) Basira? \nBASIRA \nDon't move. Either of you. \nMARTIN \nHey! Hey, hey. Whoa. Whoa, Basira, it's us. \nBASIRA \nI said don't move. This place plays tricks. \nARCHIVIST \nIt is us, Basira. \nBASIRA \n(Disbelieving) Mm-hmm? Sure. And you just happened to wander into Trevor's \npath while I was tracking him. What a fun coincidence for everybody. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 176 – Blood Ties \n23 \nARCHIVIST \nNot a coincidence. \n(Beat) \n[A trill from a bird of prey] \nMARTIN \n(Tentatively) Can I at least put my hands down? \nMy-my arms are kinda getting tired. \nBASIRA \nProve you're real. \nMARTIN \nI- Wha-what? Like, like, pinch... you, or? \nBASIRA \nProve you're really Martin Blackwood. \nMARTIN \n(Voice break) How? \nARCHIVIST \nYou could do a poem. \nBASIRA \nShut up. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 176 – Blood Ties \n24 \nMARTIN \n(Hissing) John, this is serious! \nBASIRA \nWhat's something only Martin would know? \nMARTIN \n…What? I don't know! \nBASIRA \nFine. Then— \n[She cocks the gun] \nMARTIN \nNo-no-no-no-no-no-no-no, wait, wait, uh- I- oh, god, I don't know, we've never \nhung out much! I've no idea what you know about me! \n(Beat) \nBASIRA \nWhat about you? \nARCHIVIST \nI mean— I can know (laughing) literally anything, so, ask away I guess. \nBASIRA \nYou understand how unhelpful that is for proving identities. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 176 – Blood Ties \n25 \nARCHIVIST \n(Amused) I'm sorry to be an inconvenience. \nBASIRA \nWell, you better think of something, or… \n[She waggles the gun] \nARCHIVIST \nBasira, I know you're not going to shoot us. There's already too much doubt in \nyour mind. \n(Beat) \nBASIRA \nI told you before not to look into my head. \nARCHIVIST \nSo you do believe it's me, then. \nBASIRA \n…Know-it-all prick. \n[She uncocks and holsters the gun] \nMARTIN \nS-s-so, can I…? \nBASIRA \nYeah, put them down, Martin. It's fine. You're you. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 176 – Blood Ties \n26 \n(Martin lets out a huge sigh of relief) \nARCHIVIST \nYou're sure? \nBASIRA \nIf you were monsters, that would mean I'd get to finally kill something with \nyour smug face. No way am I that lucky. \nARCHIVIST \nCan't fault your logic. \n[Rustles as she starts walking] \nBASIRA \nCome on. You've wasted enough time already. \nMARTIN \nWh… (sputtering) H-wh- hey, wait! \n[Basira pauses walking] \nBASIRA \nI said come on! \n[She restarts walking] \nMARTIN \n(Still shocked) Wh-! Wh-!
