Episode one hundred and forty-\nseven. Weaver. \n[Tape clicks on.] \nBASIRA \nHeads up. \n \nARCHIVIST \n \nThe tape? \nBASIRA \nSomething’s here. \nMELANIE \nNo shit. Look at this place. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 147 – Weaver \n \n2 \n \nARCHIVIST \nYeah. \nMELANIE \nWhen did you say they finished rebuilding? \nARCHIVIST \n2008. Doesn't look like anyone ever moved in though. \nBASIRA \nSo, this is ten years of cobwebs? \nDAISY \nMore than that. \nMELANIE \n(Sarcastic) No, I’m sure this is just the normal number of webs that grow up \norganically. \nBASIRA \nSo, where are all the spiders? \nMELANIE \nI mean, they hide. You know, it’s a thing they do, spiders. They hide. \nDAISY \n(Quietly) Perhaps they bugged out. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 147 – Weaver \n \n3 \n \nARCHIVIST \nWas that a joke? \nBASIRA \nJohn, focus. Are you getting any sense of anything? Can you See anything? \nARCHIVIST \nNo, I’m just seeing what you’re seeing. Still a bit weak from our trip North, to \nbe honest. \nMELANIE \nSorry we couldn’t stop for a snack. \n(Basira laughs.) \nBASIRA \nHere, Mel. \nMELANIE \nWhat even are these? \nDAISY \nMagnesium flares. Technically not legal anymore. If you need more, just shout. \nMELANIE \nI'm fine. Uh, a-and please don't call me Mel. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 147 – Weaver \n \n4 \n \nDAISY \nWhat? Since when? \nMELANIE \nAlways. I’m trying to be more open about this stuff. \nDAISY \nRoger wilco, Ms King. \nMELANIE \nBetter. \nBASIRA \nThese flares going to work? \nDAISY \nNo idea, but John said The Web doesn't get on great with fire, and we don't \nexactly have a flamethrower, so… \nBASIRA \nI mean, at least until we find the one Gertrude stockpiled, right next to the \nnukes. \nARCHIVIST \nI'm sure the flares will work fine. I mean, unless it's all some elaborate plot to \nhave us burn this place down again. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 147 – Weaver \n \n5 \n \nBASIRA \nSo what if it is? \nARCHIVIST \nI don’t follow. \nBASIRA \nI mean, anything we do could be part of the grand master plan. So, what, we \ndo nothing? Just sit on our hands and hope that's not what the spiders want? \nMELANIE \nRight, sure, but it wouldn’t hurt to have a bit more of a plan of our own, would \nit? \nARCHIVIST \nExactly. \nBASIRA \nYou want to come back later? \nMELANIE \nYes! That's what I said, isn't it? \nARCHIVIST \nWell, we're here now. Might as well push on. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 147 – Weaver \n \n6 \n \nMELANIE \nFamous last words. \n[Door opens] \nDAISY \nClear. Looks like nothing downstairs. \nBASIRA \nYou want to take a moment before we head up? \nARCHIVIST \nWhat about the basement? \nDAISY \nCan’t see one. \nARCHIVIST \nHuh. \nDAISY \nYou want me to take point? \nARCHIVIST \nNo. No, I-I’ve got it. \n[Footsteps on stairs. In the distance, a tape starts to play.] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 147 – Weaver \n \n7 \n \nARCHIVIST \nYou hear that? \nBASIRA \nNo, I— \nMELANIE \nShh! Yes, room on the left. \n[Muffled tape sounds of the Archivist’s opening monologue from MAG001 – \n“Anglerfish”, becoming clearer as they approach.] \nDAISY \nIs that ...? \nARCHIVIST \nYes. \nBASIRA \nDon’t touch it. \nARCHIVIST \nNo, it’s alright. \n[The tape clicks off.] \nDAISY \n Something underneath it. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 147 – Weaver \n \n8 \n \nARCHIVIST \nI see it. Hand me that brush. \nBASIRA \nIs that what I think it is? \nARCHIVIST \nYep. Official Institute paper and everything. \nBASIRA \nGoddamn it! \nARCHIVIST \nStatement of Annabelle Cane. She left it for us. \nMELANIE \nHonestly don’t know what else you guys were expecting. \nBASIRA \nWell, that’s it then. Come on, let's finish up and get out of here. \nARCHIVIST \nI-I mean, a-are we burning it? \nMELANIE \nThe statement or the building?", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 0, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 3813}}
