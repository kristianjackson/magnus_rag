I’ve asked him, plenty of times, but whenever I do, he gives me \nthis surprised look, insists he’s told me before, and then immediately forgets \nand changes the subject. I know that’s not exactly helpful, but honestly, I’m a \nbit lost here myself. I mean, none of this feels normal. Some of it doesn’t even \nfeel natural. Greg’s an odd one, sure, but until recently he’s always been very \nsharp. \nThis was all about six months ago. He’s been working on the website ever \nsince. The actual basic setup took him all of two days, maybe a bit more since \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 123 - Web Development \n14 \n \nthe client insisted on him coding from scratch. It was bare-bones, since he’d \nbeen given no copy or indication of how it was to be organised except for the \nname of the site – Chelicerae – which he made sure stood prominently at the \ntop in a tasteful sans-serif. The client had requested only a single area where \nthreads could be posted, labelled ‘Come In’. Of course, there was never \nanything in there. \nThe site was called Chelicerae, but the URL, the web address, was nothing like \nthe name, just a long string of letters and numbers with no pattern or reason \nto them, almost impossible to memorise. Once the site was live, Greg would \nget an email every few weeks with a new domain name, another long string of \ngibberish, and he would have to change it all over. \nThere were other things, though, that the client would email through. Things \nshe insisted were included not on the website itself, but in the code. I’m not \nreally a computer person, but according to Greg they had nothing to do with \nany coding language he’d ever seen. Meaningless strings of words, or weird \nlittle fragments of poetry, or a name, different every time, repeated over and \nover again, hundreds of times. He tried to explain to her more than once that \njust pasting these things into the code wouldn’t cause them to appear on the \npage, or have any effect at all, but she insisted, so he did it. \nAnd he’d been doing it ever since. He’s on some sort of retainer to \n‘administrate’ the site, and this amounts to changing the domain name every \nfew weeks, checking the statistics that, yes, still no-one has visited, and pasting \nwhatever the latest nonsense the client wants in the code. I’d have said it was \ngood money for doing basically nothing, except that over the last two months \nit’s all started to go really, really weird. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 123 - Web Development \n15 \n \nIt started with an email he got from a Hotmail address he didn’t recognise. The \nsubject line was simply, ‘ARE YOU THE CHELICERAE?’. At first, Greg thought his \nclient must have passed his details on, but opening the message, there were \njust four more words: ‘Please make it stop.’ \nNow, Greg being Greg, he just deleted the message and pretended it didn’t \nbother him, but after he told me about it, I pressed him further, and he \nadmitted that it wasn’t the first unsettling email he’d gotten from strangers \nabout the site. He wouldn’t tell me the others. He kept insisting I drop it, that it \nwas fine. That I shouldn’t worry. \nBut, of course, I did worry. I knew that secretly he was as well. I started to do a \nbit of searching online, just to see if there was anything we were missing. And \nthere was. A lot, as it turns out. It didn’t take more than an hour or so to \ndiscover that Greg had apparently found himself the web administrator for an \nurban legend. The Chelicerae popped up on the occasional paranormal site or \nedgy message board, each time accompanied by a now-defunct link. According \nto those who follow such things, all you had to do was start a new thread as a \nguest – something that Greg had been instructed to make sure was possible – \nand the title of that thread should be the name of someone you want dead. \nAs the stories went, you would receive a reply almost immediately and it \nwould simply ask you for a story. You would have to write out and post, in full, \na horrible event that had happened to you or someone that you loved. All the \ninstructions were very clear that the target would only die if the account \nsatisfied the “story-spinner”. None of them made any mention of what \nhappened if it did not.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 3, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 4371}}
