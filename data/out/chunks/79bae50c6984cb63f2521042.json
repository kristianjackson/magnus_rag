Don’t \nget me wrong, it was something I’d been itching to do for five goddamn years, \nbut I wasn’t in a rush. I had plenty of time to arrange something nasty for him, \nand I wanted him hurt more than I felt I had to do the deed myself. So when I \ngot out in June last year, I bided my time and kept my ear to the ground. Tried \nto get in touch with him, but was told by the few friends we had in common \nthat he wasn’t interested in talking to me. He’d clearly done ok for himself in \nthe years I’d been away, and could afford some muscle to make sure that I \ndidn’t bother him. I ended up with a couple of bruised ribs when I finally got \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG014 – Piecemeal \n3 \n \ntired of the run-around and tried to have it out with him properly. It was laying \nthere, some grim side street in Lewisham of all places that I came to the \ndecision that if I was going to hurt this asshole, and I mean properly hurt him, I \nwas going to have to think outside the box a bit. \nI decided to pay McMullen a visit. Before Noriega had gone to work on him, \nToby McMullen was just some street punk. These days he was just a street \npunk who had trouble turning his neck. I’ve met plenty of born losers in my \ntime, I mean it’s kind of a given in this business, but I’ve never met someone so \nintent on being a screw-up as McMullen. When I saw him he was high as a kite \nand barely knew I was there, but you bet his eyes lit up when I mentioned Paul \nNoriega. It took hours to get anything useful out of that waste of skin, but \neventually I pieced together his side of this sorry tale. Noriega had paid him a \nvisit in the hospital, apparently, before the police had picked us up, and \npromised that if he fingered me for the assault, then he’d have all of the \nnarcotics his little junkie heart could dream of. Only once he was out of \nhospital and my conviction had gone through, it wasn’t two days before \nMcMullen was out on his arse again, and Noriega didn’t want to know. Any \nidiot could have seen it would play out that way, but not poor, stupid Toby. \nStill, he’d been itching to get the knife in for almost as long as I had, and he had \nhad the freedom to plan it, so I asked him if he had anything I could use. \nI shouldn’t have been surprised when he suggested magic. Toby had always \nbeen into all of that mystical crap, even before the drugs, and if there was \nsome half-baked New Age fad going round you could bet you’d find it dribbling \nout of his mouth whenever he was coherent enough to actually talk. I punched \nhim in the gut and turned to leave. He followed me, doubled over and \nstruggling for breath, begging me to help him. He said he was serious, said it", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 1, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 2740}}
