Almost three thousand of them. Of course, when they finally \narrived to this fabled town, there was absolutely nothing there at all. Just \nempty, waiting earth. They didn’t even own the plots of land they’d been sold. \nBut they stayed, and they built a town. Not a great town, by any stretch. Not \neven a good town, truth be told, but there it was, in defiance of all good sense. \nOne of the men who settled in the newly formed Boise City was Stefan \nBrotchen’s father. He was long-dead by the time we met his son. My \nphotographer, a small man named Harry Eisenhard, had been told about the \nBrotchen farm when asking about places around the area hit bad by the \n\nstorms. Stefan’s fields had nothing left but dry earth, they told us. Farmhouse \nstripped almost bare by the harsh winds, his livestock dead and already half-\nburied, his family gone. Never found out more than that. Just… gone. \nWhen we pulled up that Sunday, the place was everything we’d been told and \nmore. We’d see the top of wheels and farm equipment poking up through the \nground, until we realised it wasn’t the ground, just a good three feet of newly \nfallen dirt half-burying the ploughs and wagon. I saw what must once have \nbeen a cow, covered from the neck up in coarse and clinging dust. Harry and I \nhad wrapped our handkerchiefs over our faces, as the men back in town had \ntold us, but the air was already thick, and I could hear Harry coughing beside \nme. I’d seen a few victims of the dust pneumonia by this point, and the sound \nof his breathing made me press the cloth close to my face, and offer up a silent \nprayer. \nStefan did not wear a cloth across his face when he came out to meet us, and I \ncould see the fine particles collecting in his hair, in the corners of his eyes. He \nsmiled warmly, and waved us over. \nI’ve tried in the years since to remember if there was anything behind that \nsmile, anything dark or secret that I might have overlooked; there was nothing. \nThe soft, friendly voice was, as far as I can tell, genuine, and as Stefan Brotchen \nsat there in his small, dusty kitchen, telling us his misfortunes, there was no \nclue in his face as to what must have been going on inside him. \nHis story was not unusual, and I’m sure that if you hunted down a copy of the \nLubbock Evening Journal from that week there’d be most of it in there. Crops \ndying, soil parched and a farm on the brink of ruin, all ruled over by that \ndesperate, empty hope of rain. He never mentioned his \n\nfamily, and I never thought to ask, though the house clearly was far too big for \nStefan to live there alone. He offered us a drink at one point, just water, but I \ncouldn’t bring myself to accept. \nI just had this image playing through my mind over and over again. He stands \nup, walks over, pulls out a bottle of thick, flowing mud, opens it, and pours it \ndown his throat with a smile on his face. Just my imagination, I told myself. Just \nletting the dust get to me. \nIt only took an hour or two before I decided I had enough material for the \nstory, and I stood up, and thanked him for his time. Harry did the same, and I \nshook Stefan by the hand. As I touched his skin, I almost pulled my hand away \nit was so hot. It was a dry, feverish heat and I looked at his face and saw for the \nfirst time the fierce, flushed redness, the forehead slick with sweat. His chest \nstarted to convulse, and he doubled over, spluttering out a clod of pulpy, \nbrown sludge onto the wooden floor. I started to ask if he was okay, but Harry \ntugged on my arm, gesturing outside with an almost wild urgency. It all \nseemed to be happening so fast I could barely register what was going on. At \nleast, until I got outside and looked west. \nThe vast, roling black clouds stretched before us, as far as we could see. It was \ncoming for us with such a speed that there was a part of me that immediately \nknew, despite all logic, that it was trying to kill me, and me alone. It was the \nworst dust storm I had ever seen, and it promised to blot out everything. I ran \nback inside to warn Stefan, and ask if he had anywhere we could wait it out, \nbut I found him lying on the ground. He was face down, a thin trickle of dirt \noozing slowly from his mouth and nose. I called to Harry, told him Stefan \nneeded help, but he could barely hear me over the wind, which was now so \nfierce that it seemed to drown everything else", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 1, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 4499}}
