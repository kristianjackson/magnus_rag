Then he moved and I realised I \nmust be watching a video file. The man was crying. There was no sound, but I \ncould see great, heaving sobs that sent his whole body shuddering. He stared \ninto a computer monitor, the edge of which I could just about see. He seemed \nto be sat in the dark and his face was solely illuminated by the screen in front \nof him. I watched with mounting dread as the video continued. \nHe reached down to what I assumed would have been the keyboard, but he \ndidn’t seem to be typing. Instead, there was a sudden jerking motion and he \nraised his hand to reveal one of the keys that he had apparently torn off. He \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 065 – Binary \n11 \n \nbrought it to his mouth and began to eat it. I could just about make out the \nsnap of his jaw as the hard plastic shattered between his teeth and, as he \nreached for the next one, I could see a trickle of blood from his lips. \nWell, that was more than enough for me. I slammed the laptop shut and \npushed it away. I decided that whatever was happening could wait until \ndaylight. I turned on all the lights in my room and sat in an armchair drinking \nuntil I passed out, trying not to think about Sergei Yushanka. \nI don’t know how long I slept for, but it can’t have been more than an hour or \ntwo, since it was still fully dark when I was woken by a snapping, crunching \nnoise. I opened my eyes to see my TV screen on. It was showing that same \nvideo, the washed out, grainy blue making details almost impossible to \ndistinguish, but there was noise now, coming through my speakers. I heard him \ncrunching and eating the keys as he snapped them off one by one. I tried to \nfigure out how the program could have jumped from my laptop to my TV, \nwhich wasn’t plugged in or networked to it. The only thing they had in \ncommon was the router and … and that didn’t make any sense, not unless \nsomeone was playing a really elaborate, really horrible prank on me \nspecifically. And I’m not the nicest person, but I’ve never pissed anyone off \nthat much. \nAll the time I was trying to figure this out, the video kept playing. The man’s \nbreathing was laboured and painful. He was talking, muttering to himself, or \nmaybe to me. There was no way to tell. I couldn’t make out much through the \nmess he’d made of his mouth and what I could hear, I didn’t understand. He \nwas talking about how, “It feels like thinking through cheese wire” and, \n“There’s no feeling, but the no feeling hurts” and that “It’s cold without \nblood”. He said that a lot: “It’s cold and it hurts.” He spoke with a Russian \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 065 – Binary \n12 \n \naccent. At one point, he stopped pulling at the keyboard and reached out in \nfront of him to where the monitor would be. There was the sound of breaking \nand he pulled back a shard of glass. I don’t need to tell you what he did with it. \nThe worst thing was, even though this meant the screen must have been \nshattered, somehow it was still illuminating his face. \nI unplugged everything: the TV, the router, the speakers, everything. Well, that \nseemed to stop it, at least... at least for a while. I was in a bad way by this point \nand I just left and wandered the streets until the sun came up. I didn’t take my \nphone, just... well, just in case. \nThat video was 17 hours long. I know this, because it followed me until I \nwatched all of it. Well, any time I used a computer, watched TV or looked too \nlong at a screen, there it was. Didn’t matter if it was my own or someone \nelse’s. After a few minutes, whatever I was looking at would melt away and \nhe’d be back, continuing to slowly, painfully eat his computer. I tried to show it \nto a friend once, but he just looked at me like I was playing some weird joke. \nOnly I could see it, apparently. I don’t want to be mad. I don’t think I am, but \nthere’s no way really to know, is there? \nAfter a month of this, I finally sat down and watched it through to the end. It \nwas the longest day of my life and by the end I felt so very sick. I almost threw \nup when he smiled. Finally, he lay down in front of the camera and said, “The \nmaze is sharp on my mind. The angles cut me when I try to think.” Then he \nstopped moving. I could see the top of his head then and the back of it seemed \nto be missing. The picture stayed like that for about half an hour and then the \nvideo ended. I haven’t seen it since.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 5, "chunk_count": 9, "chars": 4455}}
