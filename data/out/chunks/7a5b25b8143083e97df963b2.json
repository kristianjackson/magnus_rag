There is every chance \nthat I am the only one left, and the whole world has fallen to a soulless horde, \ndevoid of life and feeling. Even so, thank you for pretending to care. \nARCHIVIST \nStatement ends. \n(The Archivist exhales; his voice is sounding stronger) Well, that certainly \nhelped, I think. No notes or follow-up in the statement and obviously no \nresearch done into it by myself or, uh... my team. I think we can safely say that \nMs. St John is not the only real person left in the world, though, whatever she \nmight be doing now. And whatever might be with her. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 122 – Zombie \n \n17 \n \nIt can be hard, though, sometimes, other, other people. Feelings. I-I’m trying to \nfocus, trying to make sure I’m the same me as before, but how can anyone \nreally remember that? How do you know you’re the same person that went to \nsleep? (The Archivist sighs) \n[Knocking on door] \nYes, I’m... I’m done. \n[Door opens] \nARCHIVIST \n(Sighs) Georgie, is she, uh...? \nBASIRA \nShe’s gone. Didn’t see where. \nARCHIVIST \nNo, I, I wouldn’t’ve, uh... Probably for the best. \nBASIRA \nYeah. \n… \nBetter? \nARCHIVIST \nYes. Yes, thank you. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 122 – Zombie \n \n18 \n \nBASIRA \nRight. Then I’ve got questions. \nARCHIVIST \nSo do I. \nBASIRA \nMe first. What are you? \nARCHIVIST \nHonestly, I don’t know. I don’t feel... inhuman, or… I want to say I’m the same, \nbut I don’t really know if that’s true. I know I’m different. I feel... more real, \nsomehow. \nBASIRA \nSo, what does that actually mean? \nARCHIVIST \nProbably nothing good. \nMy turn. What… what happened to me? \nBASIRA \nHow much do remember? \nARCHIVIST \nI don’t... \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 122 – Zombie \n \n19 \n \nMusic. Everything was wrong. Gertrude was there and then... dancing? I think? \nThen… pain, and I was somewhere else. Dreaming. \nBASIRA \nDreaming? \nARCHIVIST \nYes. \nYou’re sure about Tim? \nBASIRA \nYeah, they, um… they found his remains a few days later. \nARCHIVIST \nAnd Daisy? \nBASIRA \nThey still haven’t found her body. Probably never will. I thought for a while she \nmight, um... But it’s been months. She’s gone. \nARCHIVIST \nJust you and me. And Melanie and Martin, I-I guess. Honestly, I’m surprised \nMartin isn’t... \n(Basira sighs) \nWhat? Oh, go— The, the plan. Did— Martin, is, is he okay? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 122 – Zombie \n \n20 \n \nWhat did Elias do? \nBASIRA \nNo, nothing. Elias isn’t the problem. \nARCHIVIST \nSo— What? \nBASIRA \nElias is locked up. \nARCHIVIST \nWait, Martin’s plan worked? \nBASIRA \nYeah, a bunch of sectioned officers took him in. He made some sort of deal, I \nthink, but he’s not getting out any time soon. \nARCHIVIST \nOh. Wow, okay. Great. So, what’s the problem? \nBASIRA \nHe appointed an interim director. Guy named Peter Lukas. \nARCHIVIST \nOh. \nBASIRA \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 122 – Zombie \n \n21 \n \nYeah. \nARCHIVIST \nRead about him. \nBASIRA \nYeah, I hunted down some of those old statements and... yeah. \nARCHIVIST \n(Darkly) What did he do to Martin? \nBASIRA \nI... don’t know. We don’t see him around the Archives much these days. Best I \ncan figure, he’s working on something with Lukas. \nARCHIVIST \nNo. No that, that... No. There must be something else. \nBASIRA \nMaybe. I don’t know. \nARCHIVIST \nAnd Melanie? \nBASIRA \nA lot’s happened, while you’ve been gone. \nARCHIVIST \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 122 – Zombie \n \n22 \n \nRight. \nWell, I guess we should probably let one of the nurses know I’m awake. I’m \nsure they have all sorts of tests to do, make sure I’m not a zombie or a… \n… \nI don’t suppose you brought in any clothes? \nBASIRA \nNo, I just, you know, grabbed that statement on my way out. \nARCHIVIST \nRight, well uh, I kept some in the Archives, uh, in my office. \nBASIRA \nYeah, those got, um... We had to throw those out. \nARCHIVIST \nWhat? \nBASIRA \nLike I said, a lot’s happened. \nARCHIVIST \nS-Since I’ve been… Fine. \nBASIRA \nI’ll get you some new ones.
