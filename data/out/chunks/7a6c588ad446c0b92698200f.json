Can we begin? \nARCHIVIST \nWas there anything I could have done? Could I have… \n[The sounds of the cassette tape] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG078 – Distant Cousin \n11 \n \nSASHA (RECORDING) \nHello? I see you. Show yourself. \n[The sounds of the cassette tape] \nNOT!SASHA (RECORDING) \nHello? \n[The sounds of the cassette tape] \nI see you. \n[The sounds of the cassette tape] \nI see you. \nARCHIVIST \nAnd now I see you. \n[Tape clicks off. Tape clicks on.] \nTIM \nYou wanted to see us. \nMARTIN \nAre you ok? You look awful. \nARCHIVIST \nI’m… I’m coming down with something, I think. Listen, you should take the rest \nof the day off. Tomorrow as well. \nMARTIN \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG078 – Distant Cousin \n12 \n \nAre you sure you – \nARCHIVIST \nDon’t want to infect anyone else. Best you stay home. \nTIM \nWouldn’t it make more sense if you went home, then? \nMARTIN \nAre you feverish? We should probably get you to a doctor. Look, there’s a \nwalk-in centre nearby I can – \nARCHIVIST \nNo. No, I have things I still need to take care of here. And, besides, I know \nyou’ve both been under a lot of… pressure lately. I think we could all do with a \nbit of break. \nMARTIN \nWell… well, yeah but… \nARCHIVIST \nI know, I know, a lot of it’s been because of me. Most of it. I’m sorry. Tim, I \nknow things have been… fraught. \nTIM \nI guess that’s a word for it. \nARCHIVIST \nYes, well, I think some time off could only help. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG078 – Distant Cousin \n13 \n \nTIM \nBecause you’re ill. \nARCHIVIST \nYes…. Yes. And I’m… I’m sorry. About everything. \nMARTIN \nJ-John… look, are you – \nTIM \nOk. Right you are, John. We’ll be going. \nMARTIN \nWait, what? \nTIM \nCome on, Martin. We could do with a break. Er… do you need us to tell Sasha? \nARCHIVIST \nOh, no, no. I’ll be seeing her later. \nMARTIN \nTim… Wait… \nTIM \nGreat. See you Monday. \nMARTIN \nNo, no… \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG078 – Distant Cousin \n14 \n \nARCHIVIST \nYes, see you then. \nMARTIN \nHang on, Tim, we should probably – \n[The office door closes. The tape clicks off. The tape clicks on.] \nARCHIVIST \n(Whispered) It is remarkably easy to buy an axe in Central London. Harder to \nsneak it into Artefact Storage, but not impossible. I don’t know if destroying \nthis is going to kill that thing… but I am damn sure it’s going to hurt. \n[The axe hits the wood of the table. The Archivist grunts with the effort as \nthe wood splinters.] \nHollow. Just cobwebs and dust. \n(Michael laughs) \nMICHAEL \nThat was very stupid. \nARCHIVIST \nWhat do you want? \nMICHAEL \nThere’s no other way out of this room, you know. \nARCHIVIST \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG078 – Distant Cousin \n15 \n \nWhat? \nMICHAEL \nYou don’t have time to escape before they get here. \nARCHIVIST \nThe… the… the “Not Sasha”? No, but the table… \nMICHAEL \nWas binding it quite effectively. \nARCHIVIST \nOh. Oh no. \nMICHAEL \nEven with all the protections you have on, I doubt you can survive them now. \nARCHIVIST \n(Quietly) No, no, no \nNOT!SASHA \n(Quietly as if far away. Her voice sounds even stranger than usual) \nJooooohhhnnnn…. \nARCHIVIST \nEr… I… \n[A door opens] \nMICHAEL", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 5, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 3124}}
