It made dressing gowns. Most of the time I was left to \nmy own devices. If she'd had any sense, my mother would have chucked your \nlot and gone to work at the factory full time. She would have earned a damn \nsight more. Still, she believed in the work and the one thing she was never \nneglectful of was what she called my ‘true studies’. I am grateful to her, of \ncourse. I just wish that she'd got over her slavish devotion to you and your \npatron. \nGERTRUDE \nYou make a lot of assumptions, Mary. And I thought we were supposed to be \non the same side? \nMARY \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 062 – First Edition \n \n6 \n \nMm, yeah, I suppose you're right. I just like to diversify my portfolio a bit, as it \nwere. Often during my studies, my mother would talk to me of the amazing \narcane relics that filled the Institute. I'm sure you can imagine my \ndisappointment when I finally got a look at the collection of mediocrity that \nyou call your 'Artefact Storage’. But long before that the idea of dark and \nfearful items of power had taken root in my young mind. I used to spend \nafternoons hunting through antique and junk shops. There were plenty to \nchoose from back then, searching for anything strange, hunting for that thing \nthat would call to me in a dark, secret voice. I never found it, of course, not \nback then. But when I saw Dr Margaret Tillerson moving in across the street, I \nknew immediately that there was something different about her. \nShe was tall and thin, with long, dark hair pulled into a severe bun. She wore a \ndeep blue woollen dress and carried an old leather briefcase that seemed \nconstantly on the verge of buckling, although she carried it with ease. I don't \nknow what it was exactly about her that stuck out to me, but as soon as I saw \nher, I knew she was what my mother had always talked about. She was \ntouched by powers like those that watched over our family. \nShe had a small GP practice on Nelson Street, not far from the Royal London \nHospital. Back then, Whitechapel was a heavily Jewish neighbourhood and \nthere weren't many gentile doctors around, so it didn't take Dr Tillerson long \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 062 – First Edition \n \n7 \n \nto build up a healthy client list. I started to watch her. Whenever my mother \nwas at work, I would sit myself on the steps opposite her practice and watch \nthe steady stream of patients. \nOver the weeks, I started to notice something. The first time an ambulance was \ncalled to take one of her patients to the hospital, I didn't think much of it. But \nwhen another one came the day afterwards, and another three days later, it \nstarted to occur to me that there was something more within those walls than \nI knew. I decided that I had to see for myself. \nIt had not gone unnoticed to me that many of Dr Tillerson's clients did not \nbother to knock on her front door, simply entering with a soft call to announce \nthemselves. Leaving the front door of her practice unlocked was no doubt \ngood for her clients, but also provided me with easy access when I finally \novercame my trepidation. \nI had paid great attention to how loud the door was and timed my entry to the \npassing of a butcher's truck, the roar of the engine covering the sound of the \ndoor. And then, just like that, I was inside. I cursed myself for not having spent \nmore time trying to get a sense of the interior of the building, as I had not \nexpected the waiting room to be so sparse.
