The cries and pleading of \nthe wounded and dying rose up like an awful chorus where before the air had \nbeen filled with the piping of metal birds. And God may damn me for a coward, \nbut I ran. \n \nGERTRUDE \nFinal comments. \n \nThe Stranger and its ritual have proved remarkably hardy in many ways, \nresistant to most of the standard interferences and flexible in such a way that, \nwhile the Unknowing is relatively easy to delay, full disruption seems \nborderline impossible. And yet here we see what I assume to be an avatar of \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG116 – The Show Must Go On \n \n13 \n \nThe Slaughter end an almost fully realised ritual with, if not ease, then at the \nvery least a direct simplicity. \n \nPerhaps... that’s it? Could it be that the closer The Stranger comes to \nemerging, the more damaging a physical disruption to its focus becomes? \nMore research is needed, but if that’s true, then the task becomes at once less \ncomplicated and significantly harder. Disrupting the others has been successful \nlargely because I was able to do so before they had reached any form of \nculmination, and from the description of Abraham Jannsen, I would not be \nconfident enough in my senses to attempt something similar once the \nUnknowing has become in earnest. It could probably stand as a solid plan B, at \nthe very least, and I might make inquiries about getting my hands on some... \n‘appropriate ordnance’. \n \nThis also confirms that they’re still using that ancient skin as a focus item. If it \nwasn’t destroyed by cannon fire, I imagine it will take some effort on my part \nto do so. But I am now sure I know where they’re keeping it, and if I am able to \ntake care of it, that may buy me a reasonable amount of time to research \nalternate methods. All I can say for sure is that when the Unknowing begins, I \ncertainly don’t want to be inside it. \n \n(Click) \n \n(Click) \n \nARCHIVIST \nRight. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG116 – The Show Must Go On \n \n14 \n \n \nDAISY \nThat’s it, then? \n \nELIAS \nIt’s unlikely to be identical. The Stranger is not known for its consistency. \n \nBASIRA \nBut something like that? We can’t trust what we see? \n \nELIAS \nThe familiar may seem strange, the strange, familiar. \n \nARCHIVIST \nOne long category error. \n \nMARTIN \nIsn’t, but isn’t... I thought that’s what The Stranger wants? For us to doubt \neverything? \n \nELIAS \nNo-one said it would be easy. \n \nARCHIVIST \nBrilliant. \n \nELIAS \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG116 – The Show Must Go On \n \n15 \n \nI have been doing my best to prepare you, John, to See. You should hopefully \nhave it a bit easier than the others. \n \nARCHIVIST \nAnother of my... powers? \n \nELIAS \nMore... an aspect of your becoming. \n \nDAISY \nYou don’t say. \n \nARCHIVIST \nUh... Right? \n \nELIAS \nRegardless, it should, I hope, give you an edge. Otherwise I would never \nsuggest you go yourself. \n \n(Archivist sighs) \n \nARCHIVIST \nWhat about Martin? \n \nMARTIN \nWhat about me? \n \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG116 – The Show Must Go On \n \n16 \n \nARCHIVIST \nHe should stay behind. \n \nMARTIN \nWhat? \n \nELIAS \nReally? \n \nMARTIN \nWhy? \n \nARCHIVIST \nToo many people might attract attention. \n \nMARTIN \nNo, no, I can help; I’ve been reading the statements. \n \nELIAS \nQuite right... Probably best he does stay behind. \n \nBASIRA \nWhat, so you have a back-up if John doesn’t make it? \n \nELIAS \nI’m sure that won’t be necessary. \n \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG116 – The Show Must Go On \n \n17 \n \nMARTIN \nWhat? No! \n \nARCHIVIST \nMartin, just... You can do more good here. \n \nMARTIN \nWhat, sat around drinking tea until the world ends? Or, you know, it doesn’t. \n \nBASIRA \nWe hope. \n \nARCHIVIST \nMelanie’s not coming either. I think... I think she’ll need you here. \n \nMARTIN \nFine. \n \nELIAS \nGlad that’s sorted. Now, unless there’s anything else? \n \nARCHIVIST \nNot if, uh... No. \n \nELIAS \nExcellent. Well, it’s a three hour trip up to Great Yarmouth.
