The world seemed \nbright and normal. The sun was high and shining, though none of it passed \nthough the bars, and if she tried to reach through, the light seemed to shrink \nfrom her skin. Cars passed by on the road. Somewhere, a bird was singing. The \nworld didn’t miss her, didn’t know or care about what was happening beyond \nthese walls. \nA child passed by, a girl with plaited blonde hair and a bright orange bicycle. \nTina called quietly, suddenly afraid of who might be listening on the other side \nof her cell door. The child’s eyes met hers, the first moment of human \nconnection that she had really felt since she’d arrived… but hadn’t she only just \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 185 – Locked In \n \n6 \ngot here?... and Tina felt herself begin to smile. Then the child’s eyes narrowed \nin sudden hatred as the little girl bent down, picked up a rock and hurled it at \nthe window. It passed cleanly through the bars and hit Tina square in the \nforehead. \n[Impact sounds of a rock hitting head, followed by falling back with \na crunchy landing] \n[Outdoors sounds are mostly gone; the prison sounds dominate] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nHer vision flashed white with pain as she fell back, slamming against the bench \nwith a crunch. \nPart of her wanted to lie there and weep, overcome with what was happening \nto her. But faster than that came the anger, the indignation. How dare they? \nShe did not deserve this. She was better than this. This did not happen to \npeople like her. \n[Movement to the window, and the outdoors can be heard again] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nShe clawed her way back up to the window and looked out, trying to see the \nspiteful little brat, but the girl was now behind her father, who shooed her \naway with a terror in his eyes, a terror aimed at Tina. And for the briefest of \nmoments, she was certain that the man’s fear was mocking her. \n[Footsteps and the outdoor sounds fade; followed by a door \nunlocking] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 185 – Locked In \n \n7 \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nBehind her she heard the sound of a key sliding into the filthy iron lock of her \ncell door. She tried to tell herself that sound was a good thing, that it meant \nsomeone was coming to check on her, to clear this all up, to tell her what was \nhappening. But this was not the place for such lies. \n[The door creaks open, chains jangle, the dull roar of the prison \npopulation is louder] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nThe door opened and there they stood, identical in their uniforms, their skin \nfish-belly white and their eyes gleaming with malice. \n[Heavy footsteps, chains; the door closes and sounds are fainter \nonce again] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nAnd then she was back in her cell. She didn’t remember the interview, not \nproperly. Or had it been a trial? \n[Footsteps, then sounds of sitting on the metal bench] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nThere had been a man, she was certain of it, and he had smiled as he sat across \nfrom her. And there had been a file, a thick manila envelope stained with \ngrease and coffee, which held the pages of her life typed out in a small, no-\nnonsense font. She remembered that she had read those pages with increasing \nalarm. It had all been there, all of it. Her life, her loves, her choices, her \nmistakes.
