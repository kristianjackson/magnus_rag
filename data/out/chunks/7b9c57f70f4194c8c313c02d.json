Shade constructed from \nsatin, original colour impossible to discern due to assorted stains, likely blood, \noil, and paraffin wax. The bulb is imprinted with the words \"Long life\" despite \nappearing to contain a standard tungsten filament. There is a long, thin crack \nthat runs the length of the bulb, and it is remarkably easy to cut yourself on \nthe thin glass. With the vacuum compromised, it should be impossible for the \nlight to turn on. The power cable is severed about three inches from the base \nof the stand and writhes like a beheaded snake. There is nothing in this place \nto power it. \nDespite all of this, a thin and sickly glow can be seen from underneath the \nlampshade, an irregular, pulsing light that casts rotten shadows on the piles of \ndetritus and clusters of ash and bone that surround it. Where its sputtering \nillumination falls, the colour drains from everything, leaving nothing but a \nfaded grey. It cannot survive, but still it clings to its existence, destroying \neverything around it. It smells like death. \nLeah's fingers are worn and dry, their colour painfully faded, save for a streak \nof scarlet that drip-drops from her cut fingers as she furiously scribbles her \nfindings into the notebook. The pages tear with the frenzy of her writing as she \ndesperately tries to keep her thoughts alive. \n[Distant distorted crows start cawing] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 175 – Epoch \n3 \n \n[Flickering ends; the sound of nearby metal and debris being \nshaken and tossed about starts] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nFauna: A mouldering seagull. \nLarger than any related specimen to be found before the Anthropocene age, \nthis bird has been rendered flightless by the tightly woven plastic netting that \nwinds around and around its torso, digging into the skin beneath the feathers \nand bulging over the strange lumps and tumours that cover it. Its feathers have \nturned an oily black, and its vestigial eyes are pale and sightless, relying instead \non the sounds its prey makes as they traverse the noisy junkpiles of the \ndiscarded landscape. Its beak has become hard and its edges are serrated, \nallowing it to tear apart the tin cans and hard plastics that shield its food with \nease. \nIts legs are long and many jointed, allowing it to move across the uneven \nground, and its throat is blocked with concrete, preventing it from crying and \nletting it move among the ruins in complete silence. It nests in the rusted-out \nhollows of fleeing cars, constructing intricate shelters for its young out of \ncorpse-hair and wiring. Its eggs are rusty, covered in slime, and its chicks are \nborn with plastic rings around their necks. They smell like ammonia and salt, \nand their name is meaningless, as there is no longer such a thing as the sea. \nLeah hides behind a cracked vending machine, waiting for the thing to pass. \nShe knows it can hear the rapid scratch of her broken pencil, but it is all she \ncan do to get it down, get it all down on paper, another futile warning of a \nfuture that is already here.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 0, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 4069}}
