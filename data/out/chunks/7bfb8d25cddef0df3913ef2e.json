I’ve listened to the \ntapes – I know what they talk about behind my back. How much they’ve... \nsuffered, because of this place. Because of me. God, poor Melanie... And aside \nfrom some, uh, office gossip, which, I’m not sure is... necessary, uh, or \nconducive to a workplace that... hm. It’s natural. It’s normal. There’s no... \nsinister hidden motives, or... It’s fine. It’s fine. \n \nSo, I guess... Sometime in the next few days, I go on a commando mission to \nblow up a wax museum. It’s not exactly what I was expecting from an archiving \njob. I do worry about Martin and Melanie, leaving them behind, but I suppose \nthat’s part of trusting someone, isn’t it? Letting them help how they can. \n \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG117 – Testament \n \n3 \n \n(Bitter laugh) Oh, yeah. I found something on the other body the circus stole, \nthis “George Icarus”. Apparently he was interred earlier this year. I did a bit of, \nuh, digging, and it looks like the plot and the headstone were paid for by... the \nMagnus Institute. And I can think of only one man who died within the last few \nmonths who the institute would want buried under a pseudonym, only one \nwho spent his life so close to fear that his skin would be useful in a ritual like \nthis. I don’t know what to actually do with this information, but... God. Jurgen \nLeitner. I just can’t be rid of him. \n \n(Click) \n \n(Click) \n \nBASIRA \nStatement of Basira Hussein, 2nd August 2017, at the request of Jonathan \nSims. \n \nI don’t … I don’t really know why I’m here. I mean, I know how I got here, all \nthe decisions I made until suddenly, yup, this is my life. But not the why, not \nreally. Does that make sense? [Sighing] I don’t want to be here, but by the end \nI didn’t want to be police either, so … Guess I don’t really know what I do want, \nwhich— Maybe that’s just as well. My options, they’ve gotten a lot narrower \nover the last year. I don’t know; I feel kind of bad. Everyone seems to be having \na much worse time of it than me, but I was meant to be the hostage. It’s \namazing how much you can ignore when you keep your head in a book. \n \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG117 – Testament \n \n4 \n \nMy dad would hate me talking like this. He couldn’t stand people who just \npassively moaned about their problems. He always said, “If you don’t like \nsomething, you accept it and you adapt, or you fight and you change it. \nWhining doesn’t help.” I always tried to live like that, but I think sometimes \nyou feel like you’re accepting, but it’s just denial. Well, not anymore. I’m going \nto fight and change it. I just hope I’m not heading into the wrong battle. I \nsuppose if John screws up, it wouldn’t hurt the others to have a trained pair of \nhands to help, so waxworks it is. I just wish it didn’t feel so much like \nabandoning Melanie … and Martin. \n \nBut at least Daisy’s coming along. I mean, I know she’s... difficult. Everything \nthey say about her, it’s true, it’s fair, but she’s solid. She’s a … a fixed point, \nand if she’s there, I know exactly where I stand, exactly what I’m doing, relative \nto her. She has no doubts. We go in, we plant bombs, we leave, we blow it all \nto hell. Or we die. I don’t think I’ll ever have clarity like that. Despite everything \nshe’s done, she’s still the best partner I ever had. \n \nI just hope John can keep it together. And Tim. God, Tim... I know they’ve been \nthrough a lot, but they’ve never taken something like this on before, and if it’s \nanything like when we went after Rayner... It’s going to get bad, the sort of bad \nyou can only get through if you stay focused and keep a clear head. You choke \ndown the fear, and not because its feeding some weird, horrible god like John \nthinks, but because that’s how you keep going. \n \nI guess … I guess we’re all just going to have to do what we can and see what \ncomes out the other side. How the hell did I end up having to save the world?", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 1, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 3892}}
