It may seem like a good idea, especially if, like \nme, you just spent a decade dragging shopping up three flights of stairs every \nweek, but it’s noisier, always has a worse view and is far more prone to break-\n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG018 – The Man Upstairs \n2 \n \nins and other… problems. And then there is the matter of upstairs neighbours. \nI know that higher floors will, more often than not, also have people living \nabove you, and moving from living in a top floor flat to the ground floor like I \ndid is not a common thing, but it's still true. I never had any real concerns \nabout it until I moved to the ground floor of Welbeck House. These days I keep \na much closer eye on those I live near. \nWelbeck House is a five-storey block of flats in Wandsworth town centre, a \ngreat area to live, actually. It’s close enough to London proper that you can \ncommute in easily, and enough amenities that you don't often need to, \nespecially if, like me, you're self-employed. It wasn't cheap, but I've always \nbeen good with money, so when I decided to try and actually buy a place at \nage thirty four, I was able to afford a nice flat. After almost a year of searching, \nI settled on the ground floor at Welbeck. At the time I hadn't really given much \nthought to my neighbours – those I had encountered in the course of buying \nthe place had seemed nice enough, and the previous owners of my flat hadn't \nmentioned anything. \nOn the day I moved in – this would have been late 2002 – I saw a man smoking, \nleaning out of the window just above my own. It was a grey, overcast day and \nthe forecast had said there would be rain later, so I was keen to move the last \nof my boxes inside and start unpacking, and didn't really pay him much \nattention. I remember that he was wearing a hooded jacket, though, pulled up \ntight and obscuring most of his face. We locked eyes briefly – at least I assume \nwe did – I couldn't see his eyes but I felt him looking at me – and I could swear \nI smelled the weirdest odour. It's hard to describe, halfway between the smell \nof a pavement after rain on a hot day and chicken that's starting to turn. It was \nunpleasant, to say the least, but the wind changed and it was gone as quickly", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 0, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 3110}}
