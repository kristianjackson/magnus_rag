Mmm, that’s nice. \n[Approaching footsteps, and door creak] \nLAVERNE \nCareful, she’s very possessive of that chair. \nMARTIN \nOh sorry! Didn’t mean to sit on the prophet’s throne. \n(Laverne chuckles) \nLAVERNE \nI just wanted to check if you were joining us for dinner? \nMARTIN \nOh, food! Huh! What’s on the menu? \nLAVERNE \nCold baked beans. \nMARTIN \n…Maybe later. \nLAVERNE \nIt’s there if you want it. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 190 – Scavengers \n \n32 \nMARTIN \nDo you actually believe all that stuff? \nLAVERNE \nAbout them being chosen? \nMARTIN \nYeah, the whole ‘prophet’ thing. \nLAVERNE \nAre you asking me personally, or do you want me to speak for the group? \nMARTIN \nEither. Both. \nLAVERNE \nHmm. Personally, I don’t know what I believe. I saw Melanie every week for \nmonths, and if you’d asked if I thought she was a ‘holy person’, I’d have \nlaughed. She always behaved understandably, even if her problems were \nsometimes… odd. \nMARTIN \nBut...? \nLAVERNE \nBut. The world is... w-well, I mean, it’s hell, isn’t it? Whether it’s a capital H hell \nor not, I don’t know but, that’s where we are. And Melanie and Georgie, they \ncan walk through it completely untouched. They can… rescue people, even if \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 190 – Scavengers \n \n33 \nthey can’t always protect them. I’ve listened to their own explanation of it, and \nI’ve listened to Danielle call them “prophets” or “angels” or “the chosen”. \nNeither of them really makes any sense. But... you’ve got to have hope in \nsomething, otherwise there’s no point to anything. So, I choose to have hope \nin them. \nMARTIN \nI guess that makes sense. \nLAVERNE \nIt doesn’t need to. Times like these, it just helps to believe. I’m not sure it really \nmatters what. \n[Tape clicks off] \n[Tape clicks on] \n[Voices reverberate in a different, larger tunnel space than \nprevious; chairs creak as people fidget] \nARUN \n(Earnest) So what do you think? \nGEORGIE \n(Awkward) Um… \nMELANIE \n(Awkward) Oh, okay, um... Right ah, so… Arun, I just think that the... \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 190 – Scavengers \n \n34 \nGEORGIE \nI don’t think either of us is particularly comfortable with your use of the word \n“redeemers”. \nMELANIE \nRight. \nARCHIVIST \nI thought it was quite a good rhyme. \nMELANIE \n(Aside) Shut up, John! \nARUN \nI-I, I realise you dislike that k-kind of thing, your humility is… humbling. \n(The fragile line of Melanie’s irritation is audible) \nBut… I’ve been considering your words last week, when you talked about how \nthe world we’re in… feeds on fear, how— \nGEORGIE \nMm-hmm… \nARUN \n—how it, how it’s powered and shaped and moulded by it. \nMELANIE \nAhh. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 190 – Scavengers \n \n35 \nGEORGIE \nRight... \nARUN \nAnd, well, maybe your powers feed on hope? On trust and faith and... and \nhope. I want to inspire that. So, I’m sorry if it’s maybe a little... florid, but I \nthink it’s right. \nMELANIE \nThat’s…th-that’s not how it works. Ah, is it? John? \nARCHIVIST \nHmm? Oh? No. (smugly) That’s not how it works. \nARUN \n(Sharply) And what would you know about poetry? \n(Georgie giggles) \nARCHIVIST \nOh, well, uh... I, um… \nARUN \nWh-who even is this? Are you a new follower? \nGEORGIE \nUm… \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 190 – Scavengers \n \n36 \nARUN \nI thought you said it was dangerous for the flock to get any bigger? \nGEORGIE \nAh, no. He’s... like us. Able to travel through the world. \nARUN \nAnother nightmare strider? \nARCHIVIST \nI do not want a poem. \n(More soft giggles) \nARUN \nBut… Are, are, are you sure, Prophet? \nMELANIE \nUh… yes. Yes he is. \nARUN \nHe doesn’t seem holy... \nARCHIVIST \n(Archly) And what would you know? \nGEORGIE \nJohn.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 5, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 3913}}
