There was this strange electric crackling and once I \neven got a shock when I turned a lamp on. I never brought it up with Mike \nthough. I don’t even know how I would have gone about bringing it up. \nIt was February when I got the Leitner book. I’d heard of him before, of course, \nthough I’d never met the man. The rare book trade is a comparatively small \nworld, at least within the UK, and his name would often come up whenever I \nwas gossiping with my peers. Sometimes it was about which valuable piece \nhe’d snatched for a fraction of its true value, or the ridiculous amounts he’d \npaid for a book that everyone else was sure was a fake. Occasionally there \nwere more unsavoury rumours about his personal life. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG046 – Literary Heights \n5 \n \nSo, even though I’d never personally made his acquaintance, I was well aware \nof Jurgen Leitner and his collection and, when he disappeared in 1994, I was \none of the many that heard whispers on the grapevine that a few of his books \nwere back in circulation. I never thought I’d actually get my hands on one \nthough, not until I heard about Kirsten’s death. \nKirsten Baumann was a book dealer friend of mine down in Salisbury. I suppose \nyou could call her a rival in some ways, but we’d always been very friendly. In \nfact, there were a few years back in the ‘80s when we were very friendly \nindeed. But we hadn’t spoken much in the last year or two. \nWell, in January of this year she passed away. Lost balance on the stairs and \nbroke her neck. To be honest, I wasn’t as surprised by her death as I might \nhave been, though it was rather alarming. Over the last few years the \nlandscape of the UK rare books trade has changed significantly. A lot of the big \nnames in the old guard have gone missing or retired or sometimes even been \nfound dead. The police even got involved for a while as there was talk of \nmaybe someone out there targeting booksellers, but they never found \nanything to indicate it was anything other than a coincidence. I suppose it’s \njust an example of how one generation inevitably makes way for the next, but \nKirsten was the first time it had affected someone I knew well. What surprised \nme more than her death, however, was that she had made me her literary \nexecutor and left me the vast majority of her stock. \nSo it was I came into the possession of a Leitner. It was a strange one, all right. \nEx Altiora or From the Heights was the name. It was custom bound in the late \n1800s from what I could see, though the pages looked to be significantly older \nthan that, 17th century, I would have said. It was written in Latin and seemed \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG046 – Literary Heights \n6 \n \nto be a long poem in the style of Virgil, illustrated with some quite striking \nwoodcuts. \nIt told the tale of a small, unnamed town, high on a cliff top that sees a \nmonstrous creature begin to approach. The poem is unclear whether it is a \nbeast, a demon or a god, as it uses the word interchangeably, but it is seen far \noff, its head and body lost among the clouds. The majority of the story details \nthe villagers’ attempts to prepare to do battle against this creature. But each \ntime they devise a counter-measure, the thing gets closer and is shown to be \nfar larger than previously suspected, rendering their preparations insignificant. \nAt last, when it’s almost upon them, its impossible vastness undeniable, the \nvillagers surrender to despair and hurl themselves from the cliff top onto the \nrocks far below. \nIt was a strange book and made all the stranger by the fact that it appeared to \nbe utterly unique. I could find no record of it in any catalogue I had available \nand, after a few calls to a couple of museums and archives I knew dealt with \nsimilar texts, I was convinced that this may well have been a completely unique \nbook. This didn’t please me as much as you might imagine, because what it \nmeant was that I had an artifact on my hands, one that belonged far more in a \nmuseum than it did in a library. I’d only had a museum worthy book come once \nbefore and the process of authentication and the work involved in selling it \nhad, quite frankly, not been worth the amount that I sold it for. Museums are \n... not as well funded as private collectors. \nBeyond that, there was something about the book itself that unsettled me. \nReading it was disorientating in a way that I can’t easily put into words, \nespecially the wood cuts, although they were just the village o", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 2, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 4500}}
