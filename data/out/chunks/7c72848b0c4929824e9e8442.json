I don’t know how long I walked for. It must \nhave been hours, but it felt right, like \nit was all I could do. Walking felt as natural as falling. It was only when a man \nshouted at me for \nalmost walking into him that I stopped and took stock of my surroundings. I \nhad no idea where I was. I took out my phone to find the nearest station and \nsaw that I was only a street away from Morden. I felt dizzy all of a sudden, and \nwhen I looked at the building I was stood in front of, I was not in the least bit \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG004 – Page Turner \n8 \n \nsurprised to see a brass plaque reading “Pinhole Books – By Appointment \nOnly” next to an unmarked door of dark-stained wood. I rang the doorbell and \nwaited. The woman who opened the door wasn’t at all what I was expecting. \nShe was very old and painfully thin but her head was completely clean shaven \nand every square inch of skin I could see was tattooed over with closely-\nwritten words in a script I didn’t recognise. She stood at the bottom of a flight \nof stairs, and from the top I could hear the sound of death metal blaring out of \nsome powerful speakers. I wondered for a moment if she got complaints from \nthe neighbours, playing it so loudly at two o’clock in the morning, and realised \nwith a start that it was actually two o’clock in the morning. I apologised for \ndisturbing her so late and asked if she was Mary Keay. She just snorted and \nasked in a decidedly unfriendly manner if I had an appointment. \nI reached into my bag and pulled out Ex Altiora, opening it to show Leitner’s \nname on the bookplate. At this her eyes seemed to light up, and she turned \naround to walk up the stairs. She didn’t shut the door behind her, so I took this \nas an invitation and followed her up. \nWe entered a cramped set of rooms, with books piled high in every \nconceivable corner, almost to a point where I had to be careful following her \nthrough the labyrinth, so as not to take a wrong turn. She was talking, I \nrealised, and didn’t seem to care if I heard her over the music or not. She said \nit had been a long time since she’d found a Leitner, although “her Gerard” kept \nan eye out. She gave no elaboration as to who her Gerard might have been. \nThis strange old woman didn’t seem interested in actually reading or looking at \nmy book in depth, but asked instead if I wanted to see hers. I just nodded. I \nwas out of my depth here, but I had no idea what in. I just knew that I hadn’t \nsmelled ozone since I arrived. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG004 – Page Turner \n9 \n \nI followed Mary Keay into a dingy study. It was small to begin with, but every \nwall was completely covered with packed bookshelves, crowding even further \ninto the space. Immediately my host began to scan them intently, muttering to \nherself about where “he” would have put it. I stood there awkwardly, not \nwanting to stare at the old woman, but also hesitant to do anything \nelse. Aside from the bookshelves, there was little in the room other than a \nworn desk with a very old-looking chair behind it. The desk was covered with \npapers, as well as fishing wire and a safety razor. I think it says something \nabout my state of mind at this point that I didn’t even give those items a \nsecond thought at the time. Instead, my attention was fixed on a picture \nattached to the one small area of wall not covered by bookshelves. It was a \npainting of an eye. Very detailed, and at first I almost would have said almost \nphotorealistic, but the more I looked at it, the more I saw the patterns and \nsymmetries that formed into a single image, until I was so focused on them \nthat I started to have difficulty seeing the eye itself. Written below it were \nthree lines, in fine green calligraphy: “Grant us the sight that we may not \nknow. Grant us the scent that we may not catch. Grant us the sound that we \nmay not call.” \nAt this point Mary Keay returned with two cups of tea. I hadn’t even noticed \nher leave nor had I requested the cup of black tea she pressed into my hand. \nShe asked if I liked the painting and told me that her Gerard had done it. Said \nhe was a very talented artist. I mumbled something approving, I don’t \nremember exactly what, and looked at the cup of tea in my hand. She hadn’t \noffered me any milk, and was now busily searching the shelves", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 4, "chunk_count": 10, "chars": 4499}}
