Y-Y-Yes. Of, of course.

Old fear. Primal fear. A fear of blood and \npounding feet, a fear of that sudden burst of pain and then nothing. And that \nfear was nothing. Went nowhere. Knew not what it was. \nThen it became. Or perhaps it always was and simply entered. But fear was \nhere and true and was itself, and it hungered. It wished to know more. It \nwished to feel more. It wished to be more. And to those things that hurried \nthrough the grass, that shivered through the night in their burrows and their \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 200 – Last Words \n10 \ncaves, because they knew the dark held flashing talons and shining eyes, they \nfed the fear. It was blunt and it was simple, but still it was solid enough to \nsatisfy. And the thing that was fear was sated and content. \nThen came minds that knew it differently. They grew slowly, over the \nmillennia; inch by inch they found new things to dread. The fear of their own \nend, of the things that lived in the darkness, became a fear of the darkness \nitself. And as they grew to know what it is that they saw, to give it names, and \nstruggle at learning, so too did they learn to fear that their eyes might deceive \nthem, or show them too much. \n[More familiar night insects start to fade in] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nAnd as they learned to know their friends and kin, so too did they learn to fear \nthe unknown figure, the coming of the stranger, and the silence when they \nwere alone. \n[The primordial animals fade out] \n[A thunderclap; then the fizzing of igniting fire] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nAnd when they found fire, that bright ignition of home and hope and progress, \nthe thing that was fear gorged itself on a newfound terror once again. \n[The fires gain size, while thunder echoes in the background] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nAnd as these tiny, strange minds grew and learned, they did something new. \nThey began to take their thoughts, their instincts and their horrors, and they \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 200 – Last Words \n11 \ncrystallised them. They gave them sound and form and shape to share them. \nAnd as they did the thing that was fear felt itself began to tear, to crack and \nfracture along a thousand unseen fault lines. \n[Cracking and breaking; turning into writhing, squirming] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nIt bled and warped and multiplied, and could no longer see itself as once it did. \nIt could never be whole again. \nBut within these forms were freedoms, new and wonderful dreads to push and \nexplore, new muscles to flex. The joy of oozing, crawling pestilence as minds \ndistrusted their own corrupted bodies. The satisfaction of surrounding them, \nsuffocating them, reaching down into them and drinking in their panic as \nbreath failed them. \n[Thunder and night insects fade away; squirming remains] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nAnd as they grew to learn their place within the world, the pathetic \nmeagreness of their own existence, they could not spin a story rich or grand \nenough to fully hide their own awful insignificance, lost and alone in the \nterrible greatness of the universe. And by the time these minds had reached a \npoint of intricacy to lie and scheme and puppet one other, they had also \nlearned to conceive of war. \n[Drumbeats pound a sinister call]", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 2, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 4447}}
