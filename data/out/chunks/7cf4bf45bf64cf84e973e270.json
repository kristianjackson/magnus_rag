Do you want me to tell you what she’s been up to while you were \n‘resting’? Where she is right now? \nARCHIVIST \nYou don’t need to. I already know. \nMARTIN \nI don’t. \n[Faint hissing static starts] \nARCHIVIST \nShe’s currently moving through the, “The Void.” Hungry shadows drifting in the \ndark. \n[Faint hissing static ends] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nShe’s been there a long time, now, struggling to find the path. \nMARTIN \nBut she will. \nARCHIVIST \nI think so. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 183 – Monument \n8 \nHELEN \nYeah, she does always seem to manage, doesn’t she? It’s impressive, although \na little bit… tempting at times. \nMARTIN \nLook, Helen, what do you even want? Okay you keep turning up like a bad \npenny, and, honestly it, it seems like it’s... it’s just to be a dick! \nHELEN \nGasp! I am trying to be friends, Martin. Forever is a long time. And I \noccasionally like to have some company that isn’t screaming. \nMARTIN \nWhat do you even think friendship is? \nHELEN \nI dunno, do I? The only personhood I have is from someone I ate. \nMARTIN \nYou always said you were Helen. \nHELEN \nI am. I also ate her. It’s very simple, as long as you don’t think about it. \nMARTIN \nLook. Listen okay I’m getting really sick of all of th— \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 183 – Monument \n9 \nARCHIVIST \nLeave it, Martin. She’s just trying to get under your skin. \nMARTIN \nYeah? Well, she’s really good at it! \nHELEN \nAww. Thanks sweetie. But to be honest, I’m mainly just here to see which path \nyou choose. \nMARTIN \nWhat do you mean? \nHELEN \nWell, you know, I need to know how much of a welcome mat to roll out. \nMARTIN \nHang on… \nARCHIVIST \nMartin, I’d prefer we talk about this alone. \nHELEN \nOh, I bet you would. You were probably just going to bypass it entirely, weren’t \nyou? I can’t believe you would deny him the choice to see his own domain. \nMARTIN \nMy… my wha— John, my what? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 183 – Monument \n10 \nARCHIVIST \n(Sighing) I was going to bring it up at the crossroads. Inside. I only just realised \nwe would be going this way. \nMARTIN \nI have a domain? \nARCHIVIST \nYes. \n(Helen makes a cringing noise) \nHELEN \nAwkward! Right, well. Well this seems very much like a conversation the two of \nyou should be having alone. So I’ll, I’ll be off, then. \nARCHIVIST \nWatching from a distance? \nHELEN \nThe Eye rules everything, Archivist. We’re all snoops now! \n[Helen walks to her door and opens it] \nHELEN (CONT’D) \nCiao! \n[Her footsteps echo in a corridor as she leaves, closing the door \nbehind her] \n[The high-pitched tone ends] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 183 – Monument \n11 \n(Beat) \nARCHIVIST \n(Apologetically) Martin… \nMARTIN \nAre there people, John? \nARCHIVIST \nWhat? \nMARTIN \nAre there people in my domain? \nARCHIVIST \nNot many. \n(Inhale from Martin) \n(Beat) \nMARTIN \nDo you need to do your… your thing? Make a statement about whatever’s \ngoing on in there? \nI could use a moment to think. \nARCHIVIST \nSure thing. Yeah.
