I was about to reply \nwhen a muffled scream of pain came from somewhere deep inside the house. \nIt sounded ragged, like whoever was crying out had been gagged. I looked to \nJan Novak, who showed no indication she had heard it, still staring at where I \nhad taught her my liver would be. I ran, and she watched me go without \nmoving. \nI did call the police, but they just told me that the house was currently \nunoccupied, and they’d found no evidence that there had been anyone \npresent. I took great pains never to see the class again. I avoided all tutorials, \nand simply waited until the end of term. I haven’t seen them since. \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nThat’s it? \n \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG034 – Anatomy Class \n13 \n \nDR. ELLIOTT \nNot quite. There was one other thing. When I went to the classroom shortly \nafter what should have been their final tutorial, I found something on the desk. \nIt was an apple. Next to it was a handwritten note that said “Thank you for \nteaching us the insides”. I burned the note, just in case. \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nAnd the apple, did you… eat it? \n \nDR. ELLIOTT \nDo I look like an idiot? Of course not! I cut it in half, first, to check if it was... \noff. \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nAnd? \n \nDR. ELLIOTT \nHuman teeth. Inside were human teeth arranged in a smile. Here, I brought \nyou the two halves to see for yourselves. \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nOh good lord! That’s... \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG034 – Anatomy Class \n14 \n \n \nDR. ELLIOTT \nDeeply unpleasant, yes. You can keep it, if you want. As proof. \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nWe do not want it. I’m afraid it isn’t really proof. Someone could have stuck \nthose teeth in after the apple had been cut. \n \nDR. ELLIOTT \nYou think I would do that?! \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nI didn’t say you would, I just said it was enough of a possibility that I don’t think \nyour... tooth apple has a place in our artefact storage. Also, it is technically \nmedical waste. \n \nDR. ELLIOTT \nFine. I’ll dispose of it myself. Now, is there anything else you want me? \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nNo, this should do. We’ll investigate and get back to you if we find anything. \nStatement ends. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG034 – Anatomy Class \n15 \n \n[CLICK] \nThe first thing about this statement that makes me dubious is that it comes \nfrom a fellow academic. Historic and prestigious as the Magnus Institute is, \nthere are still many within the sphere of higher education that do not grant it \nthe respect it deserves, and some have been known to make false statements \nas ill-conceived jokes. \nAnother mark against the veracity of the statement is the names of the \nstudents. A quick Internet search reveals ‘Erika Mustermann’ as the official \nGerman placeholder name, similar to the English, well, the English name ‘John \nDoe’. The same is true the other names, ‘Juan Pérez’ is the generic name of \nchoice in most Spanish speaking countries, ‘Fulan al-Fulani’ in the Middle East, \net cetera. It seems strange to me that Dr. Elliott would fail to take note of this. \nStill, Tim made contact with Elena Bower in the King’s administration office, \nand while she couldn’t find any actual records of them in the system, she does \nremember them being there, and confirms that she assigned them to Dr. Elliott \nlast year. She could be in on it, of course, but Tim seems to believe her. \nThere’s also the matter of the teeth. I stand by my assessment that there is no \nevidence they were placed there by supernatural means, but it does seem an \nawfully long way to go for a bad joke. In the end we did send them off to a \ndental specialist, but they weren’t able to tell us much beyond the fact that \nthey all seemed like healthy adult teeth, and most of them appeared to come \nfrom different people. \nThere’s not much more we can do to follow this up, without dedicating \nadditional time we can’t afford. The only other lead was Sasha’s discovery that, \nearly last year, Dr. Rashid Sadana took his own life. There’s no direct", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 6, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 3968}}
