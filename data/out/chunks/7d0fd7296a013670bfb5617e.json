I’d tell you what the nearest notable \ntown was, but there really wasn’t one. Nothing much near us at all. It was open \nand rural and, the way I saw it, absolutely filthy. I was used to the dirt and \ngrime of a city, so all that manure and rot that gave the countryside it’s \nparticular odour made me feel like I could never quite get clean. \nStill, I was happy enough to be living there. My school in Ipswich had been very \ndifficult, for reasons I’d rather not discuss, and I had no friends to speak of that \nI was leaving behind. For all the isolation and muck out there, I still felt like I \nappreciated the fresh start. \nThe village kids were an insular lot, but they accepted me much quicker than I \nhad expected. I guess they couldn’t really be picky – a place that small, you end \nup hanging out with all sorts of kids that you wouldn’t normally look twice at. \nThat’s how I met Gordon. Gordon Goodman. He never really felt like he fit the \nname. He was about fourteen, a bit older than most of the other kids by a \ncouple of years, but still one of the smallest, barely five foot two and scrawny \nas anything. His hair fell over his eyes, and you always had to ask him to repeat \nhimself, because whenever he started talking it was so quiet that you’d miss \nthe first part. I liked him, though. He wasn’t someone who’d judge you; he just \ntook everything in stride. \nNow, near the edge of Cratfield, at least as much as it had a clear edge, was a \nfield of about three acres that pretty much everyone avoided. It wasn’t the \nsort of place that gets named on a map, so everyone around just called it ‘The \nDump’, or occasionally ‘Maggie’s Dump’ on account of an old woman called \nMargaret Carnegie, who owned the place and lived in a small bungalow right in \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG084 – Possessive \n3 \n \nthe middle of it. Now Maggie was a classic recluse: hardly anyone had seen her \nfor years, and those that had would only spot her in and around her little \nhouse, carefully piling up newspapers or stacking bottles. \nMaggie was a hoarder, you see. No-one really knew where she got most of it, \nyou didn’t get much home delivery in those days, but she seemed to have a \nnever-ending supply of food wrappers and magazines and old clothes. At some \npoint she’d clearly run out of space in her bungalow, and started to store stuff \noutside. She never weighed it down or tied it up or anything, so when the wind \npicked up it got spread all over the place, and so, gradually, the area became \nMaggie’s dump. \nCratfield was a good ways away from the nearest actual rubbish tip, so it \nwasn’t long before local families started to use it as well. Anything too big for \nnormal collection got thrown out there: fridges, sofas, broken electrics. By the \ntime I moved there, the area around Old Maggie’s house was covered in junk, \nwith stained white, broken appliances, dotted all over like blisters on grimy \nskin. \nI learned all this from the other kids when they made fun of Gordon, who they \ncalled Maggie’s ‘little pet’ or sometimes her ‘rat butler’. You see, he was the \none who delivered her food. I’ve no idea why his parents had taken on the \nresponsibility of providing for her, she was probably a distant relation of some \nsort, but it was Gordon’s job to bring her groceries every few days, winding his \nway through the filth that surrounded her isolated home. \nNow Old Maggie fascinated me. Or rather, the stories about her did, because \nobviously there were stories. The two most common were that she was a \nwitch, or that she’d killed her husband and chopped him up, keeping the land", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 0, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 4473}}
