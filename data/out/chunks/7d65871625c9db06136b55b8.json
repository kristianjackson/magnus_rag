There were dozens that I could see, which meant \nthere must be hundreds more I could not. \nThere was no way I could live there after that. How could I sleep knowing how \nmany crawling horrors moved and twitched and spun their filth just a wall \naway? I’m not a fool; I know that all gardens contain spiders. Every single one \nis filled with them, nestled in any crevice or hiding spot they can find. But now I \nknew. I had seen them in their spindly multitudes and I could not unknow how \nmany were there. And I could not stop thinking of when winter would come, \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG016 – Arachnophobia \n3 \n \nand they would seek to find a way into the warmth of my home. So I had to \nmove. \nRenting in London moves very quickly, which is a pain if you’re looking to find \nexactly the right place to live, but if you just need to get out and into a place as \nfar away from a garden as possible and you aren’t choosy, it can be sorted out \nvery fast indeed. I found a place in Boothby Road in Archway. While nearby \nElthorne Road was full of houses and gardens – no doubt infested with spiders \n– my building was surrounded by concrete driveways and parking spaces, and \nthe only vegetation were a few window boxes the other residents kept. The \nplace was old, but had been kept clean enough that I didn’t need to worry \nabout hidden webs, and the rooms, though small, were open enough that I \ncould keep an eye on all corners. I was on the second floor, so any eight-legged \nintruder would have something of a climb to access it; although I was acutely \naware of the distance a spider can shoot its web when it wants to get \nsomewhere. The building was also quite happy with pets, so I got a cat. I had \nheard from a friend who had a pair of them that they have a habit of catching \nspiders and eating them – slowly and torturously. This sounded good to me, so \nI invested in an older tabby, from a local shelter called Major Tom \nThis is all a lot of superfluous information, I know, but you have to understand \nthe lengths I went to; how little I would tolerate a spider to live in my \npresence, to fully grasp how unnatural it was, what happened to me. What still \nis happening to me. \nI saw a spider about three months ago. Not unusual. Certainly not as unusual \nas I would like – even with all my precautions they still manage to get into my \nhome once a month or so. My normal course of action is to immediately flee \nthe room and leave Major Tom inside to deal with it, returning after a few \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG016 – Arachnophobia \n4 \n \nhours. In all previous cases this had worked fine – I believe Major Tom \ndefinitely ate the majority of them, and those spiders that had simply fled back \ninto the shadows, well, I can trick myself into believing they also suffered such \na fate. It may be that my grey feline companion never actually ate any of them, \nbut he was a fine enough placebo that such a thought didn’t concern me as \nmuch as it might. \nI remember that month there had been a few of them. Our building had \nacquired something of an infestation of some sort of insect I didn’t recognise – \nsmall, silvery worms, almost like maggots but slightly longer – and I assume \nthat they provided a good meal for the eight-legged little monsters. \nThis spider was different. I felt it the moment I laid eyes on the thing, standing \nin the middle of kitchen wall, displaying itself boldly, as though it wanted to be \nas visible as possible. I felt that familiar rushing fear, as though the floor had \ndropped away and a thousand tiny legs are crawling upon every inch of my \nskin. But there was something else there. I was aware of this spider in a way I \nhad never had been of others that preceded it. It wasn’t the biggest, maybe an \ninch wide, but its abdomen was swelled grotesquely. I could feel every one of \nits void-black eyes focused upon me, see each hair on its fat, bulbous body, \nand smell the venom I knew dripped from its fangs. I hate spiders, as I have \nsaid, but I would have sworn that this one hated me back. \nNone of this was enough to make me think twice about gingerly pushing Major \nTom towards the thing with my foot and fleeing the room. I made my way into \nthe living room and closed the door behind me, leaving cat and spider to deal \nwith each other.
