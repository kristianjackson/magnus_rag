It was just a dark yellow door that couldn’t be there. The man \nasked me again what was inside and I just stood there staring at it with my \nmouth hanging open in shock. \nI honestly don’t know how long I stood there looking at it. My strange client \nsaid nothing and I’d almost forgotten he was there by the time I finally made \nup my mind. I reached out and gripped the handle. It was warm. I turned it and \nas soon as I did so, the door swung open. I didn’t need to pull it at all. It \nopened slowly, but deliberately, like it was keen for me to go inside. And \nbeyond that threshold, where there should have been empty air over the \ngarden, there was a long windowless corridor. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG047 – The New Door \n7 \n \nIt was lit by electric lamps attached to the walls every ten feet or so and the \nwalls were papered over in a swirling green pattern. Running down the middle \nof the faded yellow carpet was a rug, black and thick, that disappeared off as \nthe path very gradually curved to the left. On the walls were what at first \nlooked like mirrors, but I soon realised that while a few of them were mirrors, \nmost of them were paintings or photographs of that same corridor from \nvarious odd angles. \nHere’s the thing: I don’t remember going through that door. I remember \nstanding there, looking down it with this feeling of dread and then I remember \nfeeling a surge of terror as I heard the door close behind me with a click. I spun \nround, but there was no handle on this side, just a huge, smooth mirror. I saw \nmyself stood in that strange corridor and it looked like I’d been crying for \nhours. I hammered, shouted, I threw myself against that uncaring face of that \nmirror, but nothing happened. It didn’t even crack. \nI took out my phone. My mind was muddy, but I don’t know exactly what I was \nhoping to do. Call the police, maybe? My colleagues? I think I might have \nwanted just to check the time. I had no idea how long I’d been in there. When I \nopened the phone, all that was on the screen was another picture of the \ncorridor, just like the paintings on the walls. So I started walking down the \ncorridor. I, I mean there was... there was nothing else I could do. \nIt dragged on and on, bending almost imperceptibly to the left, while every \nonce in a while there would be another corridor turning off to the right at a \nsharp angle. At first, I, I’d avoided these branching paths, thinking if I walked \nalong the corridor far enough, it would have to lead somewhere. But after \nwhat felt like miles, I finally decided that taking one of the turns, it... it couldn’t \nmake things worse. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG047 – The New Door \n8 \n \nThe branching corridors were identical. Mirrors and paintings that mirrored \nthem were everywhere and when I turned back, I think I must have gotten \nturned around because the left turn that would have led back towards the \ndoor wasn’t... it wasn’t there anymore. It was another long corridor with paths \noff to the right. The wallpaper was a different colour though, I think. It \ndefinitely changed, but I never noticed it switching. I’d simply realise that it \nhadn’t been red when I’d been walking, or blue, or purple, or whatever colour \nit was at the time. All the colours seemed to shift in that place. Even the yellow \nof the carpet and the black of the rug. It felt like I couldn’t trust my eyes. \nBased on the date of my appointment and the newspaper I found later, I think I \nwas in there for three days. It was... it was impossible to tell from inside \nthough. I don’t remember sleeping, or even feeling tired? I did spend a lot of \ntime just slumped in despair though, so maybe I slept then. I had no food or \nwater. I got very delirious by the end. It didn’t help it was so warm in there, \nalthough often it seemed like I couldn’t stop shivering, like I was cold. \nI was almost passed out from misery when I saw it. It was stood way off in the \ndistance, a long way down the corridor. It seemed almost human from a \ndistance, but as it got closer, I saw that it was anything but. Its body was thin \nand limp and when it moved, it shifted like I was watching it through rippling \nwater. Its hands were swollen and bits of them jutted out at annoying angles. It \nwas... it was moving towards me fast and as I looked, I saw that all the pictures \non the wall now showed this thing, although each distorted it differently, like a \nselection of funhouse mirrors. But all of them... all of them sho", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 2, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 4500}}
