It was \nthere, sleeping on my friend Anahita’s sofa, in the depths of my misery, that I \nfirst started to have the dreams. I found myself standing atop the very peak of \nCanary Wharf and overlooking the Barclays building where I had spent so many \nhateful hours. Behind me I could feel the pulsing beat of the light that stands \natop that looming tower; it thrummed through me and I could see the glow \npass across my skin like oil but, try as I might, I could not turn around to look at \nit. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG011 – Dreamer \n3 \n \nIt was then that I noticed that there was something wrong with the city below \nme. It was dark, lit by the sickly orange glow of the streetlamps and there too \nsomething pulsed oddly. Looking down I could see a web of dark tendrils criss-\ncrossing the streets and crawling up the buildings. They were like blood \nvessels, thick and dark, some as wide as roads and some as thin as a telephone \nwire, and they all throbbed in time with the beat of light behind me. \nI needed to get closer. Lucid dreaming has never been a skill I’ve possessed and \nI generally get swept along in the current of whatever runs though my sleeping \nconsciousness. \nSo it came as something of a surprise when my wordless desire to get closer \nbecame manifest and I moved forward. Even more surprising was that my \nforward motion brought me over the edge of Canary Wharf’s roof and I fell. I \nplummeted, I don’t know how far, until I hit the ground with a crack. I would \nhave expected this to wake me but instead I simply lay there, spasmed by \ndream-pain, you know, the knowledge of pain without the white heat of \nnerves. After some while, who can say how long in sleep, I became standing \nagain and started to move through that veined orange hellscape that I knew to \nbe the City. \nAs I moved, I will not say walked, for that would not be quite correct. I saw \npeople. Not many, and not moving, but they were there. They leered like \nphotographs, overexposed and washed out, caught and immortalised in a \nsingle instant. Each had those tendrils wrapped around them, pulsing against \ntheir stillness. One had a thin black vein that snaked around her arms and \nappeared to vanish into where her heart would sit. \nAnother, an older gentleman in a dark blue suit, laid on the ground with a \nbeating mass the size of a tree trunk crushing his legs. On the face of each and \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG011 – Dreamer \n4 \n \nevery person I saw was that same rictus of surprise, pain and terrified \nconfusion. I had never dreamed like this before, and I knew there was \nsomething in it beyond my own reeling consciousness. \nEventually my wandered drifting led me back to the Barclays building. \nSomething inside me wanted to go inside, to see what it was like in this \nrhythmic, fleshy dreamscape. The lights were on, but like they were a sodium-\nvapour orange like those outside, and as with all the other lights their \nbrightness pulsed in and out in that beating world, which seemed to rule over \nall this place. \nThe desks were set up as I knew them to be but there were no people that I \ncould see. I took the stairs, as something about the thought of riding the lift \nfilled me with a cold dread. \nIt was 23 floors to the office where I worked but if I even had legs in this place \nthey were not what carried me up that stairwell. It was there I found my own \ndesk, clear and empty as I had left it some weeks before. I then knew all at \nonce that there was something in the small office next to me. I felt it in the \nrhythm of my dream, and I carried myself across to see. It had been the office \nof my old line manager, John Uzel, and he was inside. One of the dark black \nveins had snaked in through the window and seemed to have suspended John \ntwo feet from the floor, wrapped lightly around his throat. Like all the others \nhe was still, an image held in place, dangling and hanged by this pulsing mass \nof otherness. \nI awoke at that point. Normally, a nightmare would leave me a sweating, wide-\neyed mess, but that morning I felt invigorated. It came to me that, while the \ndream had in all ways appeared as nightmarish, I had never felt any true \ndiscomfort.
