Good. \n \n(Paper rustling) \n \nMARTIN \nCase, uh, 0071304, statement of Ivo Lensik. \n \n(Martin flicks open lighter) \n \nAlright. \n \n(Martin sparks lighter and sets the file alight) \n \n(Martin sighs) \n \nStatement ends, I guess. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG118 – The Masquerade \n \n2 \n \n \nUh... Harold Silvana, number 0020406, you’ll probably do. \n \n(Martin sets the file alight and again listens to it burn) \n \nAlright, then. \n \n0140207, Dylan Anderson. \n \nYeah? \n \n… \n \nOkay. \n \n(Martin sets the file alight) \n \nThere’s plenty more on the pile. \n \n(Knock on the door and someone rattles the handle) \n \nELIAS \n(Muffled) Martin? Martin, open the door. \n \nMARTIN \nSorry, Elias, I can’t hear you. There’s a door in the way. \n \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG118 – The Masquerade \n \n3 \n \n(Impatient banging on the door) \n \nELIAS \n(Muffled) Martin, I do not have time for this. \n \nMARTIN \nThen maybe you should make time. \n \nELIAS \nUnlock the door. Now. \n \nMARTIN \nI thought you had a key? \n \nELIAS \nMartin... \n \nMARTIN \nI’m not going anywhere. \n \n(Elias kicks the door in frustration and then leaves. Martin flicks open the \nzippo again) \n \nI would hurry, though, if I were you. \n \n(Click) \n \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG118 – The Masquerade \n \n4 \n \n(Click) \n \n(Splintering wood as a door is forced open, sound of rain increases slightly, \nand footsteps heard as Daisy enters) \n \nDAISY \nCome on. \n \nTIM \nRight. \n \nARCHIVIST \n(Spluttering) Ah. \n \nDAISY \n(Hisses) Shut up! \n \nBASIRA \nJust cobwebs. \n \nARCHIVIST \nThere’s no such thing as “just cobwebs”. I don’t like it. \n \nTIM \nTough. Is this it? \n \nDAISY \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG118 – The Masquerade \n \n5 \n \nYeah, we plant the last of it here, and this place’ll go up nice. \n \nARCHIVIST \nWhat’s the range on the detonator? \n \nTIM \n(Testy) Same as the last time you asked. \n \nBASIRA \nWhere is everybody? \n \nARCHIVIST \nPreparing, I guess. Haven’t seen any of them since the last of, uh, well, \nwhatever the hell that was went inside. \n \nBASIRA \nIt’s too quiet. \n \nARCHIVIST \nCould be a trap. \n \nDAISY \nAnd? If it is, I give this a squeeze… no more trap. \n \nBASIRA \nAnd no more us. \n \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG118 – The Masquerade \n \n6 \n \nDAISY \nHmm. \n \nTIM \nDon’t fret it. And anyway, it’s not like we’re alone in here. Look, there’s Prince \nCharles! \n \nBASIRA \nEugh. \n \nTIM \nWell, if he’d been in an accident. Or the Beatles, if they’d all been in separate \naccidents. Like, like, Ringo was in a horrible fire, or, or Paul was a car crash– \nthat’s a classic. \n \nARCHIVIST \nYes, Tim, I remember them. The waxworks are... bad. Just keep an eye on them \nand if they start moving— \n \nTIM \nHit them with an axe? \n \nARCHIVIST \nSure. \n \nBASIRA \nJohn? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG118 – The Masquerade \n \n7 \n \n \nARCHIVIST \nYes? \n \nBASIRA \nWhen you were, uh, kidnapped, did you leave a tape recorder here? \n \nARCHIVIST \nWhat? I don’t think so. Why? Is there— Oh. \n \nBASIRA \nYeah. \n \nARCHIVIST \nFor God’s sake. \n \nBASIRA \nSo, where did it come from? \n \nARCHIVIST \nNot important right now. \n \nTIM \nTurn it off. \n \nARCHIVIST \nYes, I’m way ahead of you. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG118 – The Masquerade \n \n8 \n \n \n(Click) \n \n(Click) \n \n(Paper burns softly. There’s a click at the foor as Elias unlocks it and pushes it \nopen.) \n \nMARTIN \nHello. \n \nELIAS \nWhat are you doing? \n \nMARTIN \nThat one? That one was Benjamin Hatendi. You weren’t fast enough with the \nkey. \n \nELIAS \nWhat. Are. You. Doing? \n \nMARTIN \nOh, I’m sorry, can you not just look into my head? Read my mind? \n \n… \n \nWhat’s wrong?
