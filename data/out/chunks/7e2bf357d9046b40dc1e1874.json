The Magnus Archives. Episode one hundred and \nseventy-nine: \"Accomplice.\" \n[Theme finishes] \n[Tape clicks on] \n[Wind swirls, while in the distance there is a chorus of industrial \nfurnace noise] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 179 – Accomplice \n \n2 \n[Footsteps crunching on gravel; pause for a moment; then continue \nuntil finding a shelter] \n(Deep breath) \n[Hissing static starts] \nARCHIVIST \nRight. \n[Machinery noise, like conveyors, carts and scoops, and the fiery \nprocessing of waste] \n[A person shovels into a nearby furnace] \n[Hissing static ends] \nARCHIVIST \nThe heat of the furnace curls the hair on Derek’s arm. It burns in a way that is \nas familiar as it is stomach churning, like the end of a cigarette, or the flush of a \nchildhood face as it tries to block out the noises, the shame of being told to \nstop lying by the policeman who plays poker with his dad. He tries not to touch \nthe metal parts of his small workspace, as it is hot enough to raise blisters. But \neverything is metal here. His spade is metal. His hammer is metal. The tracks \nare metal that lead the rusted metal carts towards his furnace. \nThis load is full of children’s toys. Not the sad and mouldy wooden ones he \nthrew at his sister as a boy, but bright, colourful plastic that he recognises from \nhis own daughter’s birthdays, Christmases… happier times. The sight fills him \nwith dread. Where did they get these? What has happened to Tilly? He wants \nto run, disappear into the night calling her name, but he remembers what \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 179 – Accomplice \n \n3 \nhappened the last time he left his post, what the overseer took from him. His \nshovel digs into the pile of happy memories, and he tosses it into the flames, \none gruelling motion after another. The burning plastic fumes hit him, and for \na moment he staggers, reaching out a hand to steady himself. His palm sizzles \nas it comes to rest on the furnace, and he draws it back with a stifled yelp. He \nknows what happens in this place if you draw attention to yourself by \nscreaming. \nHis shovel goes back into the pile, and meets an unexpected resistance. \nSomething soft and almost spongy. He knows the texture well, and as he pulls \nthe spade away, the bright blood on it confirms his fears. Another sharp sting \nof panic washes over him, electric pulses of fear causing his muscles to lock in \nplace for a moment. Then he begins to load the furnace faster, frantically \nhurling away anything blocking the view of the body, desperately hoping to \nsee— \nIt’s not her. It’s someone else. Derek doesn’t know the man who lies in the \ncart, lifeless eyes staring at him from a head split in two by a careless shovel-\nblow. He pauses for a moment, then goes to his task, hacking up the corpse, \nand loading it into the hungry flames. The smell hits him, sickening him as it \nalways does, tinged with that cloying, greasy nostalgia. \n‘I got you.’ That’s what Colin had always said to him when they were kids. And \nhe had always meant it. When Derek needed somewhere to stay when his dad \nwas on the warpath. ‘I got you.’ When Derek needed a little something to take \nthe edge off. ‘I got you.’ When the lifeless body of Derek’s father lay at the \nbottom of the stairs, limbs folded around the cricket bat he had hit him with. ‘I \ngot you.’", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 0, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 3794}}
