And when the faceless puppet peeled its \ncreator and moved itself with their tendon-strings, he looked at me and \nlaughed and laughed. \nWe followed her a while, but she was unpredictable, while we are things of \npoint and purpose. When she lost the ancient skin, we went our separate \nways, and found ourselves a lorry, long and dirty grey. We drove the \nmotorways and country roads and took great crates of nothing to and fro, \ndriving towards a different sort of terror. It wasn’t our cargo that brought fear \nthen. We brought fear to our cargo. Smiling, waiting, patient by the road, with \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 128 – Heavy Goods \n11 \n \ncardboard signs of gentle hopes. In they went to the back, that silent heavy \nplace with boxes that seemed too big or too warm. They usually screamed as \nwe drove and drove, fear thick in the air, and sometimes they died. Some tried \nto leap from the back into the road, and one even made it through. Most \nstayed, getting weaker and weaker, their cries fading away as hunger and thirst \nand despair took their final hold. \nBut we were not content. He didn’t laugh like he used to. Driving aimless, \nwaiting for the call, sat badly with us, who were meant to know our \ndestination. We were meant to have a cargo and an address. So it was, we \nfound a man named Breekon, and we took everything they were until there \nwas nothing left but the sweet taste of a broken soul’s disquiet and confusion. \nWe took the van and started to deliver once again, but we were reckless, \ndesperate for the surety we had not felt since leaving the circus. \nAnd so, we took the Casket, a hungry thing of the earth, a crushing, choking \ntomb that will not let you die because it is too much what it is for death to find \nyou there, within its mocking shape. Buried alive. \nIt was one like us that found it, a thing of shifting names and déjà vu. A fool \nthat believed that because it found the coffin in chains it was an easy thing to \ncontrol, to bargain with. But there was no remorse when the test finally failed \nand it fed on the thing that considered itself the master. No face to change in \nthe cold, dark earth; no eye to fool where it is now. But there was no mention \nof us in the deal, no thought to what might happen should a victim pass the \ntest. And what happened was we were stuck with it. It was still our cargo. \nNowhere to take it, no address or destination, so back in the van it went. A \nlong time we’ve carried it, keeping it as close as it wants, not listening to it sing \nin the rain. Even when the mannequin that now called itself Orsinov came back \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 128 – Heavy Goods \n12 \n \nfor us, told us we could help the world unknow and fear again the coming of \nstrangers, still we had to drag it with us. An unclaimed package. \nBut I suppose it was worth it in the end. When that Hunter killed him, when \nshe took her violence of mindless instinct and unleashed it on us, it was there. \nIt was waiting. I fed her to it. She took him from me, made us a me, and she \ndoesn’t get to die for that. She gets to live, trapped and helpless and \nentombed forever. No prey. No hunt. No movement. \nWe failed, but I have at least that comfort. I am without him now. I am. I can \nfeel myself fading, weak, no reason to move, nothing to deliver. But I am no \nlonger tied to the Casket. So, you can have it. You can stare at it, knowing how \nyour feral friend suffers, knowing how powerless you are to help. And when \nyou can’t bear it any longer, knowing that you can climb in and join her. \nI have never known hate before. I have never known loss. But now they are \nwith me always, and I desire nothing but to share them with you. \nARCHIVIST \n(Weakly) Statement… ends. \n[The Archivist collapses. Tape clicks off. Tape clicks on.
