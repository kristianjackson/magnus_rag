Who does the book come \nfrom? \nMARY \nThe End, of course. I could never truly serve it. I just don't find death that \ninteresting, but I've always found a singular devotion far too restrictive. Just \nask Eric. Or what's left of him. \nGERTRUDE \nWhat about the other book? The smaller one? \nMARY \nOh, just a bit of Vissera. Poems about dying animals, also in Sanskrit. Drops a \nlot of bones. I, I don't even think it has a real title. Pointless really. I eventually \nsold it to Leitner, though it came back to me after the attack. \nGERTRUDE \nI should really tell Elias about this. \nMARY \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 062 – First Edition \n \n15 \n \nBy all means. He's not exactly big on action though, is he? He'll just be happy I \ngave a statement. \nGERTRUDE \nAnd do you have any proof of this? Your magic book. \nMARY \nHere. \n[Paper rustles.] \nYou can keep this page. I made sure it was in English. \nGERTRUDE \nOh, wh-who is it? \nMARY \nA surprise, dear. Just make sure you’re alone when you read it. Goodbye, \nGertrude. \n[The chair scrapes as she gets up.] \nWish me luck. \n[The door closes.] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 062 – First Edition \n \n16 \n \nGERTRUDE \nWell, I, I don't really know what to add to that. If what she says is true, I should \nthink carefully before reading this page aloud. I should probably destroy it. \n(Sigh) I do rather hate the smell of burning skin. Anyway, that's a decision for \nanother day. \n[A floorboard creaks.] \nI could rather do with a cup of tea, I think. \n[Tape clicks off. Tape clicks on.] \nARCHIVIST \nThere's a lot here. In many ways the context this gives Mary Keay's odd \nrelationship with death is the least interesting part of it. I knew that her family \nwas connected to Jonah Magnus and the Institute somehow, but I had no idea \nthat Gertrude was involved, even if they didn't like each other. Maybe I should \nhave known. Elias might not have killed her, but there is a lot he's not telling \nme. I'm afraid to ask though. The Magnus Institute is not what it appears to be \nand, until I know what it is and what it's for, there’s no way I'm letting Elias \nknow how much I'm aware of. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 062 – First Edition \n \n17 \n \nBut in spite of all that, I'm strangely excited, because what sticks out to me \nmore than anything else in that tape is the very distinctive floorboard at the \nend. \n[A floorboard creaks. It’s the same one as in the recording.] \nOne that hasn't changed in the eight years since this statement was given. \nThere's never been any reason to look closely at a random section of floor. This \nbit wasn't even breached by any of the worms. \n[Floorboards are moved.] \nBecause it had Gertrude's hidden compartment beneath it. Mmm. No strange \nskin page. But there is a laptop. And a key. I wonder what it opens? \nEnd supplement. \n[Tape clicks off.] \nThe Magnus Archives is a podcast distributed by Rusty Quill and licensed under \na Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Sharealike 4.0 International \nlicence. \nToday’s episode was written by Jonathan Sims and directed by Alexander J \nNewall.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 5, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 3191}}
