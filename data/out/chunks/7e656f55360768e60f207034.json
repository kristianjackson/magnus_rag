The Magnus Archives. Episode one hundred and fifty-\nseven: \"Rotten Core.\" \n[The tape clicks on. The following exchange is repeated from the end of the \nprevious episode (MAG156, Reflection) and sounds a little more muffled than \nstandard dialogue.] \n(Over the top of the recording, we can hear The Archivist’s breathing as he \nlistens.) \nMARTIN \nWill I be coming back? \nPETER \nYou’re not going to die, if that’s what you’re asking, but – no. If all goes well, \nyou won’t be. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 157 – Rotten Core \n(Martin takes a long inhale, then exhales.) \nPETER \nHow does that make you feel? \nMARTIN \nNothing. (Short laugh) Nothing at all. \nPETER \nExcellent. I’m so proud of you, Martin. \nMARTIN \nI really don’t care. \nPETER \nPerfect. \n[Tape clicks off.] \nARCHIVIST \n(A stressed sigh.) This tape was left on my desk. I don’t know by who, but to \nmy mind, there are three options. Martin has left it here to let me know that \nwhatever the situation is with Peter Lukas, it is entering its final act, and he \nneeds my help.

It looks pretty recent. Hm. First time in a while I’ve \nbeen... wary of reading one. \nStill, I guess… (He sighs.) \nStatement of Adelard Dekker, regarding a potential pandemic originating in the \ntown of Klanxbüll, Germany. Original statement given 14th August 2013. Audio \nrecording by Jonathan Sims, the Archivist. \nStatement begins. \nARCHIVIST (STATEMENT) \nYou must forgive me, Gertrude, for any typing and spelling errors that might be \nin this message. My hands are shaking quite badly and my fingers… aren’t what \nthey were. Even so, just knowing where this is going, this statement… I can feel \nthe Eye’s power on me, be it ever so slight. Steadying me. Helping the words \nflow. \nIs it strange that here, now, that seems almost a comfort? This is the last time \nyou will hear from me. You must trust me on that and not come looking. Not \nthat you would – I know you’re too smart for sentimentality, especially after \nwhat I have to tell you – but I feel it worth saying, nonetheless. Perhaps I’m \nsimply prevaricating. Trying to cling on to a few more precious minutes of life. \nBut that’s not me. I know what awaits me and must have no hesitation in going \nto my reward.
