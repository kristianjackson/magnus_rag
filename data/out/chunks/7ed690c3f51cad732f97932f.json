But I could, perhaps, identify the cause. \nAnd identify it I did. I began by checking houses, looking for anything that \nmight have been an unusual artefact or one of those dreadful books. Few \ndoors were locked, and many seemed to be swinging open in the breeze that I \nwas deeply thankful I could not smell. Still, for all the quaint homes with their \nslanted roofs that I combed through, I found nothing that might qualify as an \norigin for the small town’s gruesome demise. But neither did I find many other \nvictims. There were a few: a woman melted into her now crimson bed; an old \nman whose bright eyes still stared out of his skull, watching the television, \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 157 – Rotten Core \nthough the rest of him lay pooled on the floor. And in all of them, the frantic \nbeating of their decomposing hearts. \nThe state of these homes, however, would seem to indicate that many had \nbegun to develop symptoms while still inside. Countertops in otherwise empty \nhouses would be coated with blood; wooden floorboards peppered with flecks \nof gristle. Yet of these individuals, there seemed to be no obvious sign except a \nline of viscera leading towards the front door. \nIt was then I realized that I had been following the trails entirely the wrong \nway. They were not people returning home to die. The sick were pulling \nthemselves out of their houses, crawling, dragging themselves towards some \nother place, leaving bits behind on the rough pavement as they did so. So, I \nbegan to walk, slowly, both because of my bulky suit and the rising sense of \ndread in my stomach. I wonder, Gertrude, whether you are truly as fearless as \nyou seem, or if you are simply a master of disguising your terror. I suppose I’ll \nnever have a chance to find out. I rather hope it was the former. However, \nmuch I disagree with some of your methods, it feels good to believe there are \npeople in this world who can stare down the Devil without flinching. \nI found the source of this sickness in the parkplatz opposite the train station. \nThe cars had been pushed to the side, clearly at great cost to the bodies of \nthose that pushed them, and in the center was a figure from whom the rot \nclearly flowed. \nHe was sat upon a most dreadful throne, formed from a dozen, two dozen \nbodies mixed together like putty. Eyes staring out like horror-stricken stars \ntwinkling in the night, and their hearts beating for all to see. A moaning came \nfrom that awful seat: voices trying to scream through things that weren’t their \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 157 – Rotten Core \nthroat. And it is a sound I shall be glad to leave behind me when I go to my \nrest. \nI will confess to being perversely disappointed when I saw the figure sat upon \nit – no pale specter in a lab coat, or twisted golem of petri dishes and test \ntubes. No, he was lanky, wearing an ill-fitting brown suit and a smile. I’d never \npreviously had the misfortune to meet him, but I knew the description well \nenough to recognize John Amherst. So, it seemed it was not the Extinction, as I \nhad anticipated, but simply a new and awful strain of Corruption. \nStill, it was not something I felt I could leave to run its course unopposed. At \nfirst, I was struck almost with despair, having nothing to hand with which I \nmight attempt a confrontation with this creature, but upon retreating some \nways and considering my options, I realized I actually had almost the exact \nresources to hand that I might need. A few minutes spent scouting the \nsurrounding streets even revealed a small construction site almost precisely \nsuited to my requirements. I returned to the cordon and took what I needed: a \nstretcher, as many quarantine sleeves as I could carry, and a syringe. The \nmedical staff appeared to have retreated to the large tent that served as their \nbase of operations, and if anyone noticed me, they didn’t interfere. I loaded \nthe gear into a wheelbarrow I had taken from the building site along with a \nthick metal chain, and began to head back towards the parkplatz, stopping \nonly to fill the syringe from a can of garden pesticide I had noticed during my \nearlier sweep of the houses. \nFinally, I revealed myself. He approached me coyly, clearly believing me to be a \nfoolish or lost ECDC medic. Perhaps he assumed I was frozen in terror at the \nsight of his work, and luckily my hazmat suit did much to hide my expression.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 2, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 4441}}
