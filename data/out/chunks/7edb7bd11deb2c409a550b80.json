Each time I told him so, his face would \ntighten in momentary anger and his lips would go white. Then I would watch as \nhe took that rage and discarded it, once again becoming the genial, if \nsomewhat serious, young man I had first met. It was an odd sight. \nWhen his father died in 1834, it came as no great surprise to me that he chose \nto resign from my service. He told me he considered it necessary to become \nthe provider for his family, though I have my suspicions he was also eager to \nno longer have his designs subject to my scrutiny. I wished him well, naturally, \nbut could not honestly say I was not somewhat relieved by his departure. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG050 – Foundations \n5 \n \nIt was shortly after this I received an invitation to a small social gathering \nhosted by Henry Roberts. It was there that I met Sir Robert Smirke. He was a \ntall man, with sharp, almost saturnine features and eyes that seemed to regard \nyou in ratios and pounds of raw material. He was polite and gregarious, but I \nfound him difficult to talk to at length, as he seemed to be forever further \nahead in the conversation than I was, and I could never be sure whether or not \nI was boring him. When I realised that George was not present and there was \nno sign of his imminent arrival, I resolved to raise the matter with Sir Robert, \nregarding what exactly his tutelage had entailed. \nAt the mention of the name ‘George Gilbert Scott’, Sir Robert’s face flushed \nsuddenly with anger in a manner not entirely unlike that of his protege. He \nasked me what my interest was in Mr Scott and I told him that he had, until \nrecently, been engaged as my assistant. At this, Sir Robert gave a small laugh of \nsatisfaction and told me I did not realise exactly how lucky an escape I may \nhave had. I asked again what exactly his training had entailed, and Sir Robert \nstared at me for a silent minute, before he finally nodded his head. ‘Balance,’ \nhe told me. ‘Equilibrium – the hardest thing for an architect to achieve. \nSymmetry is easy, but does not in and of itself result in balance. To stir the \nfeelings of man, to create a small place of being, divorced from the rest of the \nworld, while still retaining that balance is the true goal of the architect.’ \nI had never heard my profession talked of with such conviction and fire before \nand I will not lie to you, Jonah, the look in his eyes when he spoke scared me. \nWithout prompting, his tirade continued and he began to talk about George, \nabout shortcuts and symmetry and a patron that the young fool did not \nunderstand. I could follow very little of it and it seemed to be decidedly \nremoved from anything that I would consider architecture, but whatever it was", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 2, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 2880}}
