As far as anyone could tell that’s all she ever seemed to do – stare at \npeople from the windows. It was unsettling but no-one had any real problem \nwith it. \nOver the next few years, the kids at the halfway house stopped causing \nproblems in the area around Hill Top Road. It wasn’t an obvious change, but \ngradually the people living there were seen less and less. Raymond was still \nthere and still seemed perfectly cheery. If anyone asked him about a resident \nwho hadn’t been around for a while, he’d explain that they’d moved on or \nfound a place of their own, and no-one really cared enough to follow up on his \ninformation. Soon the only people living in that old house were Agnes and \nRaymond. Then Raymond disappeared as well. Agnes must have been 18 or 19 \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG008 – Burned Out \n8 \n \nby this point, and still hardly ever talked. When she was questioned about \nwhat happened to Raymond she simply said he had gone away and that the \nhouse was hers. People got a bit worried at that, and the police conducted a \nsmall investigation, but the house had been legally signed over to Agnes and \nthere was no sign of any foul play. No sign of Raymond either, for that matter. \nAnd so the years passed and Agnes lived on in that old house. Hardly ever \nseemed to leave it, just watched from the windows. Folks in Hill Top Road \nlearned it was best not to keep pets, as they tended to vanish. Then, in 1974, \nHenry White goes missing. Five years old and the search turned up nothing. \nPeople have always whispered about Agnes but now the whispers got nasty. \nNasty enough that when smoke is seen pouring out of the old Fielding house a \nweek after little Henry disappeared, no-one did a thing. No-one phoned the \nfire brigade or tried to help. They just watched. Agnes must not have phoned \nfor assistance either, as by the time the fire trucks arrived there was nothing \nleft to save. Through it all, nobody saw any sign of life from within the building. \nNo screaming, no movement, nothing but the roaring of the flames. When the \nfire was finally put out, they did find human remains but it wasn’t Agnes nor \nwas it Henry White. The only body they found was that of Raymond Fielding. \nAll that was left was a badly-charred skeleton, missing its right hand. \nThat was the history of the place, as the nurse told it to me. Once the rubble \nhad been cleared away, the land had become tied up in legal complications \nrelating to the ownership and had remained so until earlier last year. She asked \nme not to let anyone else know she’d been talking about it, as she didn’t want \npeople to think she had been spreading stories. I told her I’d keep quiet and \nshe left. I didn’t see her again and was discharged soon afterwards.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 4, "chunk_count": 9, "chars": 2823}}
