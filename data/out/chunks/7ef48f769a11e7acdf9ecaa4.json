I don’t know what time the others are leaving. Might be tomorrow \nmorning, I guess. They don’t really tell me that sort of thing. They’re going to \nlet me and Martin know when they’re ready, when everything’s about to \nactually kick off. I should probably wish them luck and hope that there isn’t \ngoing to be some kind of horrifying apocalypse but... it’s rather hard to hope \nfor anything at the moment. Hope isn’t really good for anything. It’s always \nbeen action with me, it’s been doing things that helps. Never really seen the \npoint of hope. I know why I’m not a part of this action. I do. I have my own \nstuff to take care of. They think they’re giving me a chance to face my demons \nby helping to take down Elias. They don’t get that the only way to deal with \nsomething like him is to watch his eyes go dead with your hands around his \nthroat. I’ll play it their way for now, but when it comes down to it, I want to \nsee him dead. \n \n(Sighing) I … I’m so angry. Sometimes, when John’s going off on one about his \nlatest “insight”, it’s all I can do not to punch him in the teeth. I feel like I’ve \nalways been fighting. No-one makes space for people like me. You’ve got to \nelbow the comfortable idiots out of the way and then claw your way up with \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG117 – Testament \n \n6 \n \ngritted teeth. I’ve had to struggle for everything. I know it sounds stupid, to call \nstarting a ghost hunting show a fight, but it was. Tooth and nail. And I won. \nAnd then I went to that hospital and I met John and it all fell apart. But I’m still \nfighting. \n \nFor all the good it’s done me: still stuck; still miserable; still angry. New \ntraumas, but they hurt just like the old ones. Elias thinks he’s got this ingenious \nway to hurt people, but it’s just the same old bullshit in a creepy new package. \nAsshole. God, I want just want to rip his— \n(Deep breath) \n \nWhen did I start to lose the parts of me that weren’t just anger? \n \nHm. So, if you listen to this, John, if you survive, I know you wanted a \nstatement about my trip to India. So... Well... \n \nIn 1919, British troops massacred almost a thousand unarmed civilians in \nAmritsar. You know I was looking into spectres of war and violence, and I \nfound reports that these soldiers’ ghosts were still manifesting. I did my \nresearch and I figured out where and when I thought it was going to happen \nnext. I told you what I was doing, and then I went to see for myself. I was right, \nthey did manifest, but they weren’t what I thought they’d be, they were... \nfused somehow, all... mixed together. A huge angry mass of dead flesh. And \nguns. I ran away, obviously I ran away. It wasn’t like it could chase me, but... It \nturned out their bullets were more solid than I’d have guessed for ghostly \nantiques and one of them got me.
