They sat \naround on old chairs, comfortable chairs in the warm. The taste of wine was on \nher tongue, and her mouth was curled into a smile. The carefree chatter of her \nfriends surrounded her and soothed her. Or did it? \nShe wasn’t talking, wasn’t engaged with any of the bright and happy people. \nHer smile was fixed and deliberate, and it didn’t quite match her eyes. She was \namong this joy, yes, these sparkling friends, but she was not a part of it, not \nreally. She tried to be, wanted so desperately to be a part of their easy \nwarmth, and maybe they thought she was. But they hadn’t known her, not \nreally. They hadn’t seen the empty ice that filled her, that kept her apart from \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 186 – Quiet \n \n25 \nthem, that she desperately tried to thaw with each and every friendly face that \nsmiled at her. \nThe memory fades, and she shivers as her mind returns to the rain and the \nwind, tinged with the sting of salt and the slight stench of rotten seaweed, \nthough there was never an ocean here. She feels the ice within her still, and \nknows she never found anyone to melt it. And now? She never will. Those who \ntried she gripped so tightly that they couldn’t breathe, and so she lost them \nanyway. Now nobody remembers her name. If they should stumble upon an \nold photograph, some half-remembered birthday party that still brings up a \nsmile, and then see her face, sat there amongst the revellers, they will frown, \njust for a moment, as they try to remember her name. Then they will shrug, \nand forget they were even curious. They will not think to wonder about her. \nAnd it is this that she is so deeply afraid of. Not the ache of her flesh from the \nbitter cold, not the cloying dampness of the rain or the crushing fatigue from \nuncounted days or weeks or years without sleep. It is the sure knowledge that \nnobody remembers her existence enough to even wonder idly where she \nmight be, or ponder at her suffering. \nShe screams her fear to the open air, but none beside her hear it. \n(Long beat) \nMARTIN \nThank you. \nALSO MARTIN \nI’m sorry. I know it’s hard. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 186 – Quiet \n \n26 \nMARTIN \nYeah. \n(Beat) \nALSO MARTIN \nSo? What are we thinking? \nMARTIN \nI’m thinking that I didn’t ask for this. It’s not my fault they’re here. \nALSO MARTIN \nTrue. \nMARTIN \nBut I can’t keep existing like this at their expense. It’s not… it’s not right. \nWhatever happens with Elias, W-with the rest of the world... I can’t live on the \nmisery of others. \nALSO MARTIN \nThey’ll suffer either way. \nMARTIN \nI get it, okay? I-I can’t decide what happens to them. But… I just might be able \nto decide what happens to me. And… And if it comes down to it... \nI’ll get John to destroy me like the others. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 186 – Quiet \n \n27 \nALSO MARTIN \nYou don’t really believe he’d do it? \nMARTIN \nI don’t know. Maybe? \nALSO MARTIN \n…This took a dark turn. \nMARTIN \nYeah. But... this time it doesn’t feel like despair. \nIt feels like resolve. \nALSO MARTIN \nWell, hopefully it won’t come to that. \nMARTIN \nHopefully. \n[Martin takes a last sip of tea then passes the cup back] \nMARTIN (CONT’D) \nThanks for the tea. \nALSO MARTIN \nHa. We’re welcome. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 186 – Quiet \n \n28 \nMARTIN \nHa. \n[Remaining tea is splashed out; the cup is screwed back onto the \nflask and packed away] \n[Martin stands up] \nSo, how do I leave? \nALSO MARTIN \nI think we just keep walking. \nMARTIN \nAnd John? \n[Bag is zipped up] \nALSO MARTIN \nI kind of expected him to have interrupted already. \n[Also Martin stands up] \nMARTIN \nI’m sure he’ll find us eventually. \n[Footsteps head off] \n[Tape clicks off] \n[The Magnus Archives Theme – Outro]", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 5, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 3743}}
