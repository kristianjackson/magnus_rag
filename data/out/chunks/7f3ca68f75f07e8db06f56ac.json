The thought of them politely filing into every \ntutorial, just sat there, blank and staring, whether I was there or not, just \nwaiting... To be quite frank I think that bothered me almost more than being \nsat there with them. \nStill, I managed to largely avoid them until the 21st of March, when they had \ntheir second lab dissection. Hearts. I’m not an idiot. I was well aware of the \nsort of sinister nonsense that was likely to happen if I went, but I also knew by \nnow that they would attend whether or not I was there. And to leave them in \nthe lab unsupervised would be the sort of thing that would get me actually \nfired from my position. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG034 – Anatomy Class \n10 \n \nIt was a rainy morning. I remember that, because I deliberately didn’t put up \nan umbrella. Something inside me was so dreading what was going to happen \nthat the very act of opening umbrellas seemed pointless, as though my being \ndry couldn’t stop what was coming, then there was no reason not to get \nsoaked. So I was dripping wet when I entered the lab, and my glasses had \nsteamed up to the point where I could no longer see through them. When I \nwiped them clean, they revealed those seven blank faces, utterly unconcerned \nwith my sodden state. Each had somehow got the heart laid out in from them \non the dissection tray. I decided not to prolong it, and waved them to start. \nI don’t know what I expected. Maybe I thought they’d descend into some sort \nof feeding frenzy, but they didn’t. They just began to dissect the hearts, as any \nother class would, occasionally asking me polite questions. I was so taken \naback at how normal the whole situation seemed to be that it took me some \ntime to actually answer them. I did, though, and the first hour of the class \nalmost put me at least a little bit at ease. The more I thought about it, the \nmore it made sense. Maybe they were doing weird things to their insides, but \nif it was the heart, then I couldn’t see it and I couldn’t hear it. And I’d long \nsince decided with this class, that if I couldn’t see or hear it, I didn’t care. \nThen Erika Mustermann held up her heart and looked at me. I began to get \nthat sinking feeling in the pit of my stomach as she asked me “How does the \nheart pump blood?” I started to explain the biological mechanisms of the heart \npumping, when she shook her head slowly and said, “What does it look like?” \nAnd then, when I didn’t answer, “Is it like this?” \nThe heart in her hand began to spasm. Not like the regular, rhythmic pulse of a \nheartbeat, but like a balloon being rapidly squeezed at one end.
