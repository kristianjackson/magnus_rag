That everyone is trapped in, like, \nnever-ending torment, forever... I had to tell them something. \nMARTIN \nI guess. \nMELANIE \nI hate it. They just keep trying to interpret everything I do. And they keep \ncalling me “The Blind Prophet”, which is a whole other thing! \nMARTIN \nEr, yikes. \nMELANIE \nYeah, uh-huh! \n(Sigh) It’s why we head out so much. Sometimes we actually are scouting or \ngathering, but half the time... I just need to get away. \n[Several clinks from Melanie’s folded cane] \nMELANIE (CONT’D) \nIf I didn’t have Georgie, I think I might just snap and beat them all to death. \nMARTIN \nSounds like they’d probably just thank you for your wisdom, if you did that. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 190 – Scavengers \n \n26 \nMELANIE \n(Chuckle) Stop! We shouldn’t talk about them like this. They, they are good \npeople. \nMARTIN \nSure. \nMELANIE \nIt’s just… hard not to look down on people when they put you up on a pedestal \nlike that. \nMARTIN \nSo how are you and Georgie doing? \nMELANIE \nHuh, honestly? Er, well, these were not the early relationship hurdles I \nexpected. \nMARTIN \nGod, tell me about it. \nMELANIE \nBut don’t get me wrong… Georgie’s incredible. And-and she’s far, far too good \nfor me. And I, I only hope she doesn’t realise that while there’s an apocalypse \non. \n(Heavy sigh) \nYeah. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 190 – Scavengers \n \n27 \nAnd what about John? \nMARTIN \nOh, you know John. He’s a complete mess. But, so am I and... I think we’re \nmaking it work. Communication can be… difficult when you’re on an unholy \npilgrimage. (short chuckle) \nMELANIE \nModern dating, eh? \nMARTIN \nNightmare. \n(Melanie chuckles, then exhales loudly) \nMELANIE \nUm… Did you meet anyone else out there? \nMARTIN \nYeah, l-loads actually. In fact we… we saw Basira and Daisy. \nMELANIE \nAre-Are they alright? \nMARTIN \nNo. Not really. \nMELANIE \nOh. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 190 – Scavengers \n \n28 \nMARTIN \nDaisy had kind of gone full monster. \nMELANIE \nAh. \nMARTIN \nAnd Basira kind of... had to kill her. \nMELANIE \nOh. Oh… Oh that’s, ah… \nMARTIN \nYeah. (Sighing) So, now Basira’s on her way, but she’s taking her own route. I \nthink she needed some time to process. \nMELANIE \nWell, I mean that, that makes sense, though I’m, I’m not sure how much \n‘processing’ she’ll manage out there surrounded by ah… \n(Martin makes an agreeing sound) \nOh— oh, I nearly forgot! Careful of Helen, if you see her. \n(Martin makes a questioning sound) \nAh, she turned up a while back and tried to eat Celia. \nMARTIN \nShe was here? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 190 – Scavengers \n \n29 \nMELANIE \nYes… a few times. \n(Sighing) Looking back, I was stupid! \nMARTIN \nBecause you kind of liked her? \n[Several clinks from Melanie’s folded cane] \nMELANIE \nYes. Yes… \nHonestly I had started to think she was on our side. \nMARTIN \nYeah. \n(Melanie sighs) \nJohn killed her. \nMELANIE \nUh, sorry, what?! \nMARTIN \nYeah, she tried to— I wasn’t there, but they got into a standoff and he... he \ndestroyed her. \nMELANIE \nHe can do that? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 190 – Scavengers \n \n30 \n(Sound of assent from Martin) \nWell. I mean that’s... that’s interesting to know. Ah— \n[Approaching footsteps] \nMARTIN \nOh yeah, it’s a who— ah. \n[Wooden knocking] \nMELANIE \nOh, oh god, I forgot. I-I promised I’d listen to some of Arun’s latest stuff. \nMARTIN \nNo worries, do you want some company? \nMELANIE \n(Quietly) I wouldn’t put you through that. \n(Martin snorts) \n[Melanie gets up and opens the door] \nMELANIE \n(Quietly) I swear, if it’s another hymn I am going to break something! \n[Footsteps fading away as Melanie leaves] \n(Martin pauses, sighs) \n [Martin makes himself comfortable on Melanie’s chair] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 190 – Scavengers \n \n31 \nMARTIN \nOoooooh. Mmm, that’s nice. \n[Approaching footsteps, and door creak] \nLAVERNE \nCareful, she’s very possessive of that chair. \nMARTIN \nOh sorry! Didn’t mean to sit on the prophet’s throne. \n(Laverne chuckles) \nLAVERNE \nI just wanted to check if you were joining us for dinner? \nMARTIN \nOh, food! Huh! What’s on the menu? \nLAVERNE \nCold baked beans. \nMARTIN \n…Maybe later. \nLAVERNE \nIt’s there if you want it.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 4, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 4145}}
