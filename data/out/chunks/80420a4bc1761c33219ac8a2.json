Well? \nJUDE \nAren’t you going to say your words? \nARCHIVIST \n(Sigh) Statement of Jude Perry, regarding… some advice. Recorded direct from \nsubject, April 24th, 2017. Statement begins. \nJUDE (STATEMENT) \nWell, if you smother a flame, it dies. The only way it grows and flourishes is if \nyou feed it. It’s about making sure you find enough fuel for it, and… not caring \nwhere it comes from. If you spend your time hiding and fretting about who you \nhurt, you’ll sputter, and you’ll die as surely as any candle. Don’t be afraid to \nburn. \nThe pain is sensational. You feel your flesh cooking, your nerves screaming out \nas they die exquisitely. Your whole body changes texture as you become that \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG089 – Twice as Bright \n10 \n \nwhich feeds the fire. In that agonising, beautiful transformation, you can feel it \nignite again and again and again. \nAt least, that’s how it feels for me. I don’t know how it would feel for you. \nMaybe you get an itchy eye? I don’t care. The point is, whatever form it takes, \nyou have to feed it for it to grow strong. Otherwise you’re the one that gets \nconsumed. \nI never hid my flame. Not once. Even before I found my god, I burned as bright \nas I liked, and those who ventured too close simply ended up fuelling my \nbrilliance. At the time, the closest thing I had to god was cocaine, though I also \nspent my evenings as an acolyte to alcohol. \nBut my true thrill was money. Not mine, of course, though I had plenty, but the \nmoney of others I could fling upon the pyre of the stock market. Whether it \nignited into something more or simply burned down to ash meant nothing to \nme, it was the thrill that I craved. \nThis is decades ago now; I was one of the top bankers for… eh, it doesn’t \nmatter, they’re not important. Not to mention that a series of severe fires has \nlong since put them out of business. The point was, that I burned through too \nmuch of myself, because I didn’t know what else I could burn. My girlfriend \nsaw it, though she had no idea how to help with the deep depression that had \nsettled over me. \nI never slept much to begin with, but… now even the choice seemed denied to \nme. I was sluggish and listless at work, and people began to notice. My rating \nbegan to drop. My colleagues would whisper, and not-so-subtly leave me off \ninvitations for what little socialising there was. I was burned out in every sense \nbut one. And that was the one that saved me. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG089 – Twice as Bright \n11 \n \nIt was Agnes, of course. I don’t know where she found me, I only remember \nsitting in a booth with a beautiful young woman who smelled like matches and \nincense. I was drinking coffee so hot it peeled the skin from the roof of my \nmouth, but I didn’t care, because looking at her filled me with every kind of \nheat. We were talking about sacrifice, about power, about… things that even \nnow I struggle to fully understand. \nShe was soft-spoken and shy, and… I gradually became aware of other people \nstood around us. There seemed nothing remarkable about them at first: \ndifferent clothes, different ages, just a dozen or so unremarkable strangers. \nThere was something in their faces, though, a vicious hunger that I knew \nmirrored my own. And they all looked at Agnes with such devotion. \nOne of them, a round-faced black woman I’d later know as Sandy, squatted \ndown next to me, and stared into my face. She made a noise of dismissal, and \nleaned in close to stare at me. She said, “I don’t think so,” and her breath hit \nme like a furnace. I instinctively thrust out a hand to push her away. But as I \ntouched her face, she remained still, and instead my hand sank into it like \nsoftened candle wax. \nI screamed, but if anyone heard me, they didn’t do anything. I could only stare \nas thick rivulets of molten flesh flowed down my arm and onto the ground, and \nSandy’s body shook as though with laughter, even as my hand stayed encased \nin her warped and yielding head. I probably don’t need to describe how much \nit hurt. It would be a long time before I was able to use the hand again. \nAt last, I calmed down enough to pull my scalded, wax-encrusted hand from \nher head. She stood up, pressed her fingers to her face and calmly squeezed it \nback into shape.
