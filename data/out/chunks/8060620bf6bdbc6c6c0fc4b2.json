But it is not the fall that terrifies him, not the pain of the impacts, but \nthe fact that none of them should be there. That it doesn’t make sense. And it \nmust make sense. There must be a system. There must be, because if there \nisn’t... \n[The body lands wetly and solidly] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nHe lands with a heavy smack onto rough limestone and lies still, his body \ntwisted and broken. He knows it will knit itself back together, slowly, painfully, \nas it always has before. But the thought of starting over, of composing yet \nanother theory, fills him with a deep dread. \n[Sounds of the body continuing to knit itself together] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 183 – Monument \n16 \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nThe broken doctor is not along in the room where he now lies. Another figure, \nstooped and mumbling, staining bloody notes into a torn and discoloured robe \nglances over at him. A sneer passes across the cracked face of the doctor — he \nknows this man, a ‘professor’, at least he puffs himself up to be. His curled lip \nis reflected in the face of this pretender who scampers over to where he fell, \nchunks of stone clutched tight in pink and bloody hands. \n‘I told you,’ the professor gloats, ‘that your precious compass-point rubric is \nnonsense. It’s all about the stone, the rocks that make up this place. \n[Rocks scraping] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nYou see, here we have the limestone, here the granite. Taste it. No? Your loss. I \nhave also identified basalt and slate in various qualities shot through the \nstaircases in veins. Now, if we ascribe a hierarchy of spiritual purity to these \nstones with the hypothetical, but inevitable, marble at the top, then it will be a \nsimple matter of following the current of these stones through the—’ \nThe doctor that lies on the floor has recovered just enough to laugh. \n‘You’re still working on mineral theory? How painfully outdated.’ \nA flash of genuine fear crosses the face of the professor at this dismissal, \nbefore he picks up his chunk of granite, and begins to smash the doctor’s head \nin, yet again. \n[Sounds of brutal peer review via three thwacks with a granite slab] \n[Hissing static starts] \n[Sounds of the wasteland return; footsteps as Martin returns] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 183 – Monument \n17 \nMARTIN \nFinished? \nARCHIVIST \nYes. \n[Hissing static ends] \nMARTIN \nGood. \n(Beat) \nI need you to explain something to me. \nARCHIVIST \nAlright. \nMARTIN \nHow do I have a domain? That doesn’t make any sense. \nARCHIVIST \nIt’s like I said. Everything here is either watcher or watched. \nMARTIN \nSubject or object, yes, I know, we’ve been over this. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 183 – Monument \n18 \nARCHIVIST \nWell, you’re a watcher, Martin. You worked for the Institute, you read \nstatements. The Eye is… fond of you. You’re not getting thrown into your own \npersonal hell, which means... \nMARTIN \n(Quietly) That one of them belongs to me. But that’s… H-How can I be a \n‘Watcher’? I didn’t even know it existed! \nARCHIVIST \nBut you’ve suspected for a while now, haven’t you? \nMARTIN \nMaybe. But that’s not ‘watching’! \nARCHIVIST \nDo you want me to tell you about it? \nMARTIN \nNo. \nYes. \nN-No. No. I don’t know. I dunno. \n[Hissing static starts] \nARCHIVIST \nIt’s a small domain. A swirling mix of The Eye and The Lonely. Inhabited by a \nfew lost souls whose fear is not of their isolation or their agonies, but that no-\n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 183 – Monument \n19 \none will ever know of them. That they shall suffer in silence, and be mourned \nby nobody. \n[Hissing static ends] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nThat’s why you can’t really see it. It’s why even if we do travel through it, you \nwon’t be able to see any of the people trapped there. \nMARTIN \nBut I’m not an avatar. \nARCHIVIST \n(Heated) Avatar isn’t a thing, Martin! It’s not— \nIt’s just a word. A word used by… fools like Smirke to try and sort everything \ninto neat little boxes, to reduce the messy spray of human fear into a checklist: \nHuman, avatar, monster, victim. Only now, now there’s a binary. There’s finally \na clear dividing line and, well, I’m sorry you’re not happy with which side \nyou’ve ended up on. \n(Beat) \nMARTIN \nWhat about Daisy? Or Basira? \nARCHIVIST \nDaisy carved through the domains of others. Basira, well... in a very real way \nshe was a sufferer in Daisy’s domain. Maybe the only one.
