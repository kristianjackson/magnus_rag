New romance is hard. And \nArmageddon makes it even harder, never mind the fact that you’re \nmetaphorically joined at the hip thanks to the whole ‘eye-lord’ thing. It’s okay \nto want some space. \nMARTIN \n(Suspicious) Ohhhhh, I see. \nALSO MARTIN \nSee what? \nMARTIN \nI get it. So that’s your deal. You tell me what I want to hear to try and get me to \nstay. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 186 – Quiet \n \n8 \nALSO MARTIN \n(Wearily) Seriously? Fine. If you don’t want to engage, if-if you want to \npretend I’m just some... temptation ghost, you go ahead. Knock yourself out. \nLike I said, I’m not your enemy. \nMARTIN \n(Archly) Oh really? I thought you said you were me? \nALSO MARTIN \nRight, yes. Very clever. \nMARTIN \nWe have our moments, I guess. \nALSO MARTIN \n(Half chuckle) \nLook, if you want to leave, you can. It’s not a problem. \nMARTIN \nYou won’t try stop me? \nALSO MARTIN \nI mean, it really doesn’t matter to me. You leave and I’m just you again. It’s all \nthe same to me really. \nMARTIN \nSo why do you want me to stay then? Hmm? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 186 – Quiet \n \n9 \nALSO MARTIN \nBecause you want to stay. Because you want to have a real rest. To just \nbreathe and… (sigh) be quietly sad I guess. \n[The rain gets a little heavier] \n(Long beat) \nMARTIN \nIt’s not healthy. \nALSO MARTIN \nMaybe not, but I’m not entirely sure what healthy options are even left at this \npoint. \nMARTIN \nWe could talk to John about it. \nALSO MARTIN \nWe could. But we both know that loved ones make the worst therapists. \nThey’re too wrapped up in trying to stop you hurting, to actually help. But hey, \nwe know all about that, am I right? \nMARTIN \nThere’s nothing wrong with comforting people. \nALSO MARTIN \nA cup of tea isn’t a resolution. At best it’s a... a plaster. At worst... a muzzle. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 186 – Quiet \n \n10 \nMARTIN \nYeah, yeah. \nEven so, I could murder a cuppa. I doubt you’ve got a kettle out here though. \nALSO MARTIN \nAs a matter of fact, I do have a thermos. \n[Also Martin unzips his backpack] \nMARTIN \nYou’re joking? \nALSO MARTIN \nThis is our domain. You’re not supposed to suffer here. Well, not like the \nothers… you know what I mean. \n[A metal flask is unscrewed] \n[Elongated sound of tea pouring] \nALSO MARTIN (CONT’D) \nHere. \n[Flask is resealed] \n(Martin sighs deeply as he sips) \nMARTIN \nWait that’s… wait, is that…? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 186 – Quiet \n \n11 \nALSO MARTIN \nYeah, sorry about that. There’s only so much we can do, what with the new \nworld and everything. Even the good things get tinged with memory. \nMARTIN \nEurgh. Oolong. Of course. Of course! Whenever I asked a question she didn’t \nlike or she wanted to stop the conversation— \nALSO MARTIN \nOff you’d go to put the kettle on. \nMARTIN \nAnd it always had to be that bloody oolong. Eurgh. \n(Another sip) \nBlergh. \n(Beat) \nALSO MARTIN \nIt wasn’t your fault. \nMARTIN \nYes it was. \nALSO MARTIN \nThat’s just the guilt talking. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 186 – Quiet \n \n12 \nMARTIN \nOh, you think? \nALSO MARTIN \nShe was awful. \nMARTIN \nShe wasn’t well. \nALSO MARTIN \nBoth things can be true. \nMARTIN \nShe was still my mum! Op-our mum. Whatever! \nALSO MARTIN \n(Emphatically) And we’re glad she’s dead. \nMARTIN \nJesus... \nALSO MARTIN \nToo much? Like I said, I’m a bit more open. \nMARTIN \nI— \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 186 – Quiet \n \n13 \nALSO MARTIN \nDon’t lie. You don’t need to. Not here. It’s just us. \n(Heavy sigh from Martin) \nMARTIN \nIf we’re glad, why do I feel so... \nALSO MARTIN \nGuilty? \nBecause you feel guilty about everything. \nMARTIN \nThat’s… That’s not— \nALSO MARTIN \nYour mother. \nMARTIN \nStress is a proper factor in a stroke— \nALSO MARTIN \nEverything that’s happened to John. \nMARTIN \nI brought Jane Prentiss to the Institute!", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 1, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 4080}}
