I-I mean, you \nwould have agreed, right? \nMARTIN \nThat’s not the point, John. \nARCHIVIST \nI’m sorry. \nMARTIN \n(Sighs)…It’s okay. I understand. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 177 – Wonderland \n12 \n[Fabric rustles as they embrace] \nBASIRA \nYou done? \nARCHIVIST \nCan we not have a moment? \nBASIRA \nNo, John, we can’t. This is a chase, remember? Time is a factor. \nARCHIVIST \nLess than you might think. \nSo what happens next? \nBASIRA \nWhat do you think? You just cost me my only lead to Daisy. All I have now is \nyou, and you owe me. \nARCHIVIST \nSo I guide you to Daisy. \nBASIRA \nIs she close? \nARCHIVIST \nWhen did I become everybody’s satnav? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 177 – Wonderland \n13 \nBASIRA/MARTIN \nJohn. \nARCHIVIST \nYeah, alright. \n[Faint hissing static rises and fades] \nNo, not really. She was here, but the corridors of this place are... Rushing isn’t \ngoing to close the distance faster. It’s more about how we choose to move \nthrough these domains rather than our speed. \nBASIRA \nWhat does that mean? \nMARTIN \nI’ve been with him the whole way and I still don’t know. \nARCHIVIST \nIt means we’ll reach her quicker if you stop tearing off, and let me concentrate \non finding a proper path through this place. \nMARTIN \nYeah, speaking of, where actually are we, anyway? I mean, I’m happy to be out \nof the woods, but— \nARCHIVIST \nWonderland House. A, uh... mental ‘health’ facility. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 177 – Wonderland \n14 \nMARTIN \nOh. Oh dear. \nARCHIVIST \nMm-hmm. \nRight. Daisy. Give me moment. \n[Hissing static starts] \nBASIRA \nSo... Did you actually walk all the way down here from Scotland? \nMARTIN \nKind of. Scotland’s not really a thing anymore. \n[Indistinct tannoy announcement] \nBASIRA \nHuh. London’s still there. Sort of. \nMARTIN \nYeah, that’s where we’re heading. Eventually. \nHe’s been destroying other avatars on the way. \nBASIRA \nOh. That’s… good, I guess. \nHow’s he doing it? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 177 – Wonderland \n15 \nMARTIN \nHe’s getting the Eye to, like… like, look at them? H-He just kind of drinks up all \ntheir fear and they, uh, they just sort of… implode? \nBASIRA \nSounds satisfying. \nMARTIN \nYeah. Not sure how much good it does, though. And one of them was a kid. \nBASIRA \n(Strong) John killed a kid? \nMARTIN \nWhat? No. No! No, I just mean, one of the avatars we saw was, like, thirteen or \nso. \nBASIRA \nThat’s messed up. \nMARTIN \nYeah. We had to let him go, ‘cause... well, I mean... \nBASIRA \nYeah. \nMARTIN \nYeah. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 177 – Wonderland \n16 \n(Beat) \nBASIRA \nWhat’s it like? Being with someone who can see the inside of your head? \nMARTIN \nHm? Oh. Oh no, he doesn’t. I told him not to, and so he tries to… look away. \nBASIRA \nAnd you trust him to do that. \nMARTIN \n(Certain) Yes. I do. \n(Beat) \nBASIRA \nSo what’s your plan? \nMARTIN \nLong term? Elias. He’s up in that… Panopticon tower thing. \nBASIRA \nFigured as much. What’s he up to? \nMARTIN \nJohn doesn’t know. He says it’s a ‘blind spot’. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 177 – Wonderland \n17 \nBASIRA \nA blind spot. \nMARTIN \nA-Apparently. \nBASIRA \nConvenient. What about Melanie? \nMARTIN \nHe’s... not sure about her either. He can’t see her or Georgie. \nBASIRA \nDead, then. \n[Hissing static ends] \nARCHIVIST \nNo. Not dead. Just hidden somehow. \nBASIRA \nBack with us, then? \nARCHIVIST \nI know the route. \n[Bag zipper jangles as the Archivist repositions it] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nCome on. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 177 – Wonderland \n18 \n[Footsteps start again] \nIt… will take us past Daisy’s victim, though. \nMARTIN \nVictim? \nBASIRA \nShe’s been killing. \nMARTIN \nWhat? No, no, that can’t be right. I thought people weren’t even allowed to die \nany more. \nARCHIVIST \nNot permanently, but… Ah. \n[They abruptly stop walking] \nBASIRA \nWhat is it? \nMARTIN \nReally? Now? \nARCHIVIST \nI’ll try to be quick. \nBASIRA \nWhat’s going on? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 177 – Wonderland \n19 \nMARTIN \nIt’s, it... he needs to make a statement. \nBASIRA \nIs that like a euphemism or…? \nMARTIN \nEw, no! It’s... um, he sort of describes the place he’s in to the recorder and… \nLook it’s, it’s magic Eye stuff. He can’t help it. He needs to do it and if he \ndoesn’t… \nBASIRA \nHe gets constipated? \nARCHIVIST \nHardly! \nMARTIN \nActually, yeah, basically. \nBASIRA \nRight. \nARCHIVIST \n(Annoyed) Look if you can both just give me some space, I’d appreciate it. \nMARTIN \nFine.
