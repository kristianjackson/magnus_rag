Original statement given on 2nd April, 2012. Audio recording by \nJonathan Sims, the Archivist. \nStatement begins. \nARCHIVIST (STATEMENT) \nEveryone thinks they’re too smart to get involved in a cult. I’m sure you do. \nYou think that, of the first mention of aliens, or the end of the world, or the lost \nbook of the Bible where Jesus buried his holy staff in the foothills of the \nHimalayas, you’d go running. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 153 – Love Bombing \n2 \n \nTrouble is, that misunderstands how it works. I mean, when I was with the Divine \nChain, some of the smartest people there were also the most committed. \nIntelligence doesn’t make you less prone to taking on bad ideas, it just makes you \nbetter at defending them to other people and to yourself. Smart people can \nbelieve some truly ridiculous things, and then deploy all the reason and logic at \ntheir disposal to justify them, because a belief doesn’t begin in your mind. It \nbegins in your feelings. Cults are very good at finding you when you’re at your \nlowest point, when you’re your most emotionally vulnerable. And when you’re at \nthat point it’s astounding what can crawl into your heart and start to fester there. \nI hit my lowest point when I turned 41. That’s when my life came crashing down, \nat least on the inside. From the outside I’m sure everything looked pretty much \nokay. I was getting gigs, I had a job, I had plenty of friends and a supportive \nfamily. But that was when I started to properly look at my life, and I really didn’t \nlike what was looking back. I was a stand-up comedian you see, and a really good \none. That’s not boasting, that’s just the truth. And I’d always assumed that that \nwas enough to eventually have real success, and for the first 10 years it seemed \nlike I was right. I worked my way up, performed for basically nothing basically \nevery night and got to be pretty successful. \nAnd then I stayed that way for the next 10 years. Trouble is - do you know how \nmuch a “pretty successful” comedian makes? Let’s just say I had a full-time office \njob and was still barely making rent. But between working full-time and gigging \nfull-time I just kept putting off everything else in my life, always so sure the big \ntime was just around the corner. This is the TV spot that gets me noticed, this is \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 153 – Love Bombing \n3 \n \nthe sell-out fringe show that makes me mainstream, this is the deal that actually \ngoes somewhere. \nI made it through turning 40 with my self-image intact, but for some reason at 41, \nI just cracked. I realized I’ve spent most of my life with nothing to show for it, but \na few awards no one cares about, a string of awful comedian exes who broke up \nwith me for being funnier than them, and a dreadful office job I was going to be \nworking until I died because I’d never bothered to build a stable career. I was \nnever going to own a home, I was never going to have kids, never going to have \nthe life I’d spent my entire youth sacrificing for. And yes, I know that 41 isn’t \nactually too late for most of that, but try telling that to someone who’d just \ndecided they’ve wasted their life. I felt like I couldn’t talk to anyone about it. My \nfriends were all comedians who really didn’t want to hear it, my family were \nblandly supportive to the point of uselessness. Oh, they had plenty of soothing \nplatitudes, but platitudes wouldn’t get me back 20 years. I was in a really bad \nplace. \nThen a friend recommended a meditation course to me. I thought I’d give it a \nshot. Obviously the meditation course didn’t mention anything about the \norganization behind it. I had no idea it was anything other than a standard \nevening class, and it had exactly the right level of pseudo-mystical nonsense to it \nto get me comfortable. A little bit of tarot imagery here, some misinterpretation \nof chakras there, a touch of sweet-smelling incense to tie it all together and you \nhave a meditation class that is exactly my level. I mean, let’s put it like this - I \ndon’t believe in the power of crystals but I still have plenty dotted around my \nbedroom. I do", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 0, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 4500}}
