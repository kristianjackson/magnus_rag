It was almost meditative. I’ll always be grateful to Lana for \nletting my do that – a lot of the higher-ups were kind of arseholes about it, \nhiding behind faux-concern that “my condition made closing up on my own \npotentially dangerous”, but Lana, to her credit, ignored them and we never \nhad an issue. Well, not that sort of issue, at least. \nSo obviously, once the ‘Nights at the Circus’ display went up, I spent several \nevenings drawing and redrawing it, copying every curve of the almost \nfeatureless face, the line of the limbs, the poise of the feet, over and over until \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG083 – Drawing a Blank \n7 \n \nI got it right. So when I came in one day to find that the ringmistress \nmannequin had been replaced, I knew instantly. It was wearing the same \nclothes, certainly, and was posed the same way, but I could see the difference. \nIf I hadn’t known it in such detail, I never would have noticed. Certainly no-one \nelse mentioned it, and when I asked Lana if there’d been a change, she just \ngave me a blank look. I was sure, though. The arms were just a little bit longer, \nthe neck ever-so-slightly twisted,and the face, where before there had just \nbeen the faintest hint of a nose and a slight smile, was almost completely \nblank, save for a small patch of broken plastic near its forehead. \nSometime after I had left the previous night, someone must have snuck in, \nundressed and removed the mannequin already there, and put the clothes on \nthis new one before replacing it in the exact same position. It didn’t make any \nsense. \nI thought about trying to bring more attention to it, but nothing had been \nstolen, and the changes were so small that, even if I could convince them, what \nwere they going to do about it? So I kept quiet. I was working in the soft \nfurnishings department that week, and the mannequin was down in \nWomenswear, so I didn’t see it that much. Even so, any time I had an excuse to \ngo past it, I made sure I did. There was something about this new one, \nsomething in the way it didn’t quite fit with all the other figures on display, the \nway it held the whip in cruel, sharp fingers. And the way its head never moved, \nbut somehow I couldn’t shake the feeling that it was watching me right back. \nDisconcerting as it was, there wasn’t really anything I could do about it, and \nafter a few days I was starting to get used to the replacement. I had almost \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG083 – Drawing a Blank \n8 \n \nconvinced myself I was overreacting, if not actually mistaken, when I was \ncalled in to Lana’s office, just as I got into work. \nHer expression was stern, and she told me to close the door behind me when I \ncame in. She asked me if I’d stayed late the night before, after closing time, \nand I told her yes I had. I started to talk about what I’d been drawing, but she \nheld up her hand to stop me. She asked if I had done anything other than that, \nwhether I had tried out “any other artistic pursuits”. I was confused and told \nher as much, and she asked me if I’d seen anyone else there last night and I \nsaid no I hadn’t. Then she asked if I’d messed with any of the displays and once \nagain I said no. \nShe sighed, and I couldn’t tell whether it was in relief or exasperation, but she \nopened her desk drawer and retrieved some printouts. They were photos of \none of the autumn displays. I had noticed on the way in, when I’d gone past \nthat particular window, which had previously been showing off raincoats, I \nbelieve, it had been empty. In the picture, however, it was not. \nThe raincoat mannequin had, it seemed, been… disassembled, then rebuilt into \na tangled bunch of limbs and joints. The torso was upside down and the two \narms jutted out from the front and back of the pelvis, bending up to hold the \nmannequin’s head aloft. It had been dressed in an assortment of lurid red and \npurple shirts from our pyjama range, and someone had clearly stolen some \npaints from the craft department and daubed a colourful, smiling face on top \nof the blank space that had previously been there. They had finished it with a \nred pompom crudely glued onto the top of the head. The effect was alarming \nand put me in mind of a clown.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 2, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 4322}}
