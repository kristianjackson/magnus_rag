O Negative and infected with malaria. Not just malaria \nthough, but yellow fever, hepatitis B and signs of cholera. There were other \nsubstances in the sample as well, that they were unable to identify. We were \nall told that we were to be quarantined immediately, and that our project was \nshut down until further notice. I remember standing there in the lab as they \nsaid this. I heard a strangled cry from behind me, and turned around to see \nNeil, shaking his head over and over, his face a mask of rage and hatred. He \nwasn’t looking at the people who had come to quarantine us though. No, he \nwas looking at the room full of mosquitoes, as though they had planned this, \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG045 – Blood Bag \n7 \n \nas though it was purely through their malicious intent that he was watching his \ncareer burn to nothing. \nBefore anyone could stop him, he grabbed a fire extinguisher and ran into the \nmosquito room. God knows what he was hoping to achieve. Spray a few cages \nto death in some petty act of revenge, maybe? He never got the chance. \nAs he fumbled with the release mechanism, a tremendous buzzing filled the \nair, and suddenly I realised what they had been doing clustered around the \ngauze those nights. There was no time to pull Neil out, so I did the only thing I \ncould. I shut the door. \nThousands of mosquitoes erupted from those cages, far more, I thought, that \nwe could possibly have had on site. There was no way to count them though as \nthey swarmed onto poor Neil; first his hands and his face, then beneath his \nclothes, until there was no part of him not covered with the things. He swatted \nat them, killing some, but there were just too many, and after a few seconds it \nwas clear he was going into shock. He tried to scream, but that just gave them \nmore places to drink from. \nThat was when I turned away. There hadn’t been a single drop of blood spilled, \nbut we all knew that Dr. Neil Thompson was dead. I don’t remember much \nafter that. There was a lot of shouting and a lot of noise, then tests. Confused \nand worried academics asking me questions that, of course, I couldn’t answer. \nIt was almost a month before the world was in focus again. \nThe faculty have been all right to me actually, so I should probably be thankful. \nThey were so keen to get this swept neatly under the rug that they just let me \ngo, with such a glowing reference I just walked into a lab tech position at King’s \nCollege.

Any solution to the issue of malaria \nthat doesn’t concentrate on wiping them out is not one that I have much time \nfor.
