You see, he was the \none who delivered her food. I’ve no idea why his parents had taken on the \nresponsibility of providing for her, she was probably a distant relation of some \nsort, but it was Gordon’s job to bring her groceries every few days, winding his \nway through the filth that surrounded her isolated home. \nNow Old Maggie fascinated me. Or rather, the stories about her did, because \nobviously there were stories. The two most common were that she was a \nwitch, or that she’d killed her husband and chopped him up, keeping the land \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG084 – Possessive \n4 \n \nas messy as possible so nobody would think to dig him up. I never met anyone \nin town who remembered her actually having a husband, or course, but there \nwere plenty of kids who claimed to have seen her creeping past their houses at \nnight, or staring into their windows. Davey Morgan even said that she’d chased \nhim through the woods with a knife, but we all knew he was a liar. Even so, the \nstories terrified me, and I loved them. \nI never wanted to actually meet Maggie. I was far too scared of her for that. \nBut, I used to love walking with Gordon while he took groceries to her. I’d see \nhow close to her house I could get before I got spooked and ran home. I used \nthe bigger bits of rubbish as markers. After a few weeks I could always make it \npast the broken red sofa, and the bravest I got was the washing machine \nwithout a drum, all the while picking my way past sodden newspaper and \nrusted cans. \nGordon, for his part, never seemed to mind. I reckon he was thankful for the \ncompany, as he would chat away softly to me as we walked, either ignoring or \noblivious to my fear. \nWhenever I ran back to the fencepost that marked the start of Maggie’s Dump, \nand was therefore, in my mind, safe, I would turn back to watch as Gordon \nreached the bungalow. He’d press the little doorbell, and stand there waiting \nas the door swung open. I could see a figure stood there: long, white hair and a \ndressing gown the colour of rust. They would lead Gordon inside, and the door \nwould shut behind them. I would never see him come back out. \nI tried to convince myself he just needed to help her with chores, but deep \ndown I knew she was doing something dreadful to him. My mind would \nconjure grotesque images of knives and bubbling cauldrons full of rotting food, \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG084 – Possessive \n5 \n \nand I’d generally scare myself so badly that I never ended up waiting for more \nthan ten minutes. \nWhich, thinking about it now, is probably why I didn’t see him come out. But, \nhe was always at school the next day, alive and unharmed. He’d just smile \nwhen I asked him what he did in there. He’d shrug and say she just wanted to \nask him to stack stuff, but on those days I would notice that his fingernails \nwere always stained, and slightly caked in dirt. \nThen, one day in early October, Gordon didn’t show up at school the next day. \nI’d walked with him the evening before, but I hadn’t even made it to the \nwashing machine. I’d seen him go inside, and now he was gone. Nobody \nseemed bothered, and one teacher said his parents had called him in sick, but I \nwas certain: this time Old Maggie hadn’t let him go. \nI ran over to his house as soon as school finished, and knocked on the door. His \nfather answered, and when I asked him where Gordon was, he told me he was \nup in his room with a fever. I asked to see him, but was told very firmly that he \nwas asleep. I looked Gordon’s dad in the eyes as he said this, and I knew that \nhe was lying to me. If anyone was going to save him from Maggie’s knife, it was \ngoing to have to be me. \nThe sun had almost set by the time I reached The Dump, and the bungalow \nseemed much taller, silhouetted as it was against the darkening purple sky, \nsurrounded by the filthy, white corpses of unwanted electricals. But that \nwasn’t right. Maggie wanted them. Maggie didn’t want anything to be lost. She \nwanted them to stay, and rot. \nYou know, for all the fear Maggie inspired in me, I was completely unprepared \nto be right about her. Not the knife, I got the knife wrong, but I do think that", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 1, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 4310}}
