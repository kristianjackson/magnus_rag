Within two hours, I was out of Oxford on the first train I could \njump onto. I jumped off at Birmingham to avoid a ticket inspector, and that’s \nwhere I spent the next several years. Given my start in life, I’ve done very well \nfor myself and I now have comfort, education and money. I try to think that \nI’ve left my past behind, but that sort of denial doesn’t help me sleep. I only \nhad my first truly restful night since that day after reading about the fire that \nburned the house to the ground, but now they’re building there. They’re \nbreaking ground that should be left burned and empty and I’ve started to \ndream again. \nARCHIVIST \nStatement ends. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 059 – Recluse \n14 \n \nMr Sinclair was not exaggerating when he described the difficulties of tracking \ndown information on any youth halfway house in Hill Top Road, or Raymond \nFielding more generally. While I am naturally inclined to suspect conspiracy, \nMartin informs me that the nature of the gaps looks like lost or damaged files. \nThere are whole swathes of records missing from that period, not only related \nto Fielding, but many other similar institutions in the area. There’s no attempt \nto cover up or redirect it either; it just looks like whichever cabinet housed \nthose records got lost or damaged in the years since. \nI have done my best to prevent Martin reading this statement in too much \ndetail. I have no interest in having another argument about spiders. In fact, \nafter reading this statement, I have no interest in thinking about spiders any \nmore than is professionally required. It raises further questions about the \nrelationship between Raymond Fielding and this ‘Agnes’, and I can only hope \nsome answers lie elsewhere in the archives. I wouldn’t be surprised. Between \nRonald Sinclair, Ivo Lensik and Father Burroughs, it appears there’s still much \nto learn about Hill Top Road. \nEnd recording. \n[Tape clicks off.

They’ve taken to working farther away from me than \nnormal, and when I call them for any reason, they’re always keen to leave as \nsoon as possible. They share furtive glances when they think I’m not looking. I \ndon’t like it. I feel like they’re planning something. \nEnd supplemental. \n[Tape clicks off.] \nThe Magnus Archives is a podcast distributed by Rusty Quill and licensed under \na Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Sharealike 4.0 International \nlicence. \nToday’s episode was written by Jonathan Sims and directed by Alexander J \nNewall. \nIt featured: Jonathan Sims as The Archivist.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 6, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 2683}}
