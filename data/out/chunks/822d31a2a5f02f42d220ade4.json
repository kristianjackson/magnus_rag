The remains of an \nancient city utterly lost to time and hidden somewhere near the Xingu River. \nMy first expedition was alone, save for a handful on indigenous guides. I \nbelieved myself prepared, but the realities of that jungle were more than I \ncould have foreseen, and when it finally ended, my fever-addled mind named \nthat spot, the furthest we had reached into the jungle, “Dead Horse Camp”, \nbecause that is where my horse finally fell. I retreated in defeat and resolved \nto return to Dead Horse Camp at a time when I was truly ready. That time was \nfive years later, in 1925, and I honestly believed that this time I was going to \nfind Z. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 133 – Dead Horse \n \n4 \n \nI was more prepared and, crucially, I planned not to go alone. The Xavante, \nwhose territory we were entering, were said to be violent and distrustful, \nmaking a large expedition unwise, so I instead brought my son Jack on board, \nas he had been travelling with me before and I trusted his instincts almost as \nmuch as I did my own. He in turn requested I include one other on the journey, \na long-time friend and confidante of his, a man named Raleigh Rimell. \nI never liked the look of Raleigh. He was tall, and his features, though any one \nof them might have been called handsome, were badly put together on his \nface, giving him an appearance I’ll admit I took against at our first meeting. \nMore than that, he had also read Manuscript 512, and I could see in his eyes \nthe same fervour to find the city of Z as I sometimes glanced in my own. \nAlthough there was something else there as well, behind them, something \ndarker that I did not recognise, and I am hesitant to consider it too deeply, \neven now. But Jack saw fit to invite him, and I had never before had cause to \nsecond guess Jack’s judgement in such things. \nIt was Raleigh that suggested we proceed alone after we left Dead Horse camp. \nI had ensured this time we would be well-provisioned. We had horses, dogs, \nmules and a pair of local laborers who had agreed to act as our guides. But on \nour arrival at the camp, Raleigh dismissed them, and started to move all of our \nsupplies onto only a few of the animals. He told us we would have to be quick \nif we were to find what we sought, and we couldn’t do that with a trail of \nanimals behind us. He used that word a lot: quick. I tried to explain to him that \na methodical search would be more effective, but he just continued to mutter \nit. Eventually I relented. Much as I was growing to dislike Raleigh as a person, \nhe raised several good points about our chances of avoiding any sort of \nconfrontation with the Xavante, and Jack was quick to voice his support.
