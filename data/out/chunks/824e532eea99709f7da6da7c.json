I wanted to dress to intimidate, but I didn’t really have \nany appropriate clothes, so I just wore a suit. As it turned out, I needn’t have \nbothered – this overly generous antiques dealer was almost as big as I was, and \nunlike me, he looked like he could handle himself. \nHe didn’t even look at me when he entered the pub, almost deserted at that \ntime on a Tuesday afternoon. He sat opposite Neil, while I stood awkwardly \njust outside their booth. They talked hurriedly and quietly to each other, and I \ncouldn’t make out many of the words, though it seemed like they were just \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG045 – Blood Bag \n5 \n \ndiscussing the price for the syringe. Eventually I saw a couple of briefcases \nexchange hands, and that was it. The dealer got up and walked out, holding a \nsuitcase that seemed much lighter than the one he’d come in with. Neil gave \nme a relieved nod, and headed back to the laboratory with his own suitcase, \nthat I can only assume was full of cash. \nThis is when things… started to go wrong. When things started to get weird. I \ndon’t know if it had anything to do with Neil selling that syringe. I mean, I don’t \nknow how it… could have, but that’s when the trouble started. \nThe first thing I noticed was the heat. Now mozzies need to be kept at a \ntemperature of around 23 to 24 degrees Celsius, which might not sound too \nhot, but at this point it was late May and we were started to head towards \nsummer, so on a sunny day the room where we kept the cages felt… stifling. \nBut as the days wore on, the heat started to seep out into the rest of the lab, \nuntil we were all coated with sweat for most of the day. \nWe called the building manager to get the heating checked, and he told us \neverything was working fine. He even agreed to turn on the air conditioning for \nus, but it made no difference. The lab was warm and humid, everything felt \nsticky, and I took to bringing in a change of shirt for when I left at the end of \nthe day. Luckily none of the chemicals we were mixing into the faux blood bags \nwere particularly temperature sensitive, or God knows how much work we \nmight have lost. \nThat was unpleasant, of course, but there was no real evidence of it being \nparanormal. No, that didn’t come until a couple of weeks later. The mozzies \nstarted acting unusually. We kept them in metal mesh cages so they’re \nviewable at all times. There’s a hole in the front which is lined with gauze that \ncan be gathered up to make a seal or allow you access to the cage. Normally \nthey’re happy enough to flit about their cages. But then, without warning, they \nstopped. They landed on the cage and just stayed there. They were distributed \nalmost completely evenly over the inside, to the point where it almost looked \nregimented, and then they would stay like that for hours. It was unsettling, and \nmore than once the researchers retrieved some for testing, looking for any \nchange that might have resulted in this altered behaviour, but everything came \nback normal.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 3, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 3127}}
