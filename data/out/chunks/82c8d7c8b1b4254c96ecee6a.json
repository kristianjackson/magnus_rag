Consider it a test. Things are coming, things that will need John to be far \nstronger and more willing to use his connection to our patron. His performance \nduring the Unknowing was ... disappointing. I needed a way to force him to \nharness his ability more acutely than he had before. The coffin was a useful \ntool, Daisy an adequate bait. \nBASIRA \nThen you messed up. Way he tells it, he doesn’t know how he got out of there. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 135 – Dark Matter \n \n11 \n \nELIAS \nBut he did. And his powers were no small part of it. Even if he required some \nassistance, they were what saved him, and he has still achieved what no-one, \nmortal, monster, or anything in between, has ever been able to. He climbed \nout of the Buried. \nBASIRA \nBut what’s the point? You aren’t getting your ritual off from in here, so what \ndo you need him for? What’s so important you need him stronger? \nELIAS \nI have been observing a recent increase in people and supplies being moved to \nthe small town of Ny-Ålesund, in Svarlbad. An increase which I believe may be \nlinked to a rather desperate attempt by the People’s Church of the Divine Host \nto perform a crude ritual of their own. To bring their “Mr Pitch” into the world. \nBASIRA \nThe People’s Church? But I thought— \nELIAS \nYou thought the final death of Maxwell Rayner might have sufficiently derailed \nthem? Yes, that was my hope too, but alas, it would seem not. \nBASIRA \nMaxwell … You. You called in that tip, sent us out to that warehouse. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 135 – Dark Matter \n \n12 \n \nELIAS \nAnd now I’m sending you out again. \nBASIRA \nAnd why the hell should I trust you this time? \nELIAS \nI rather feel the real shame would be letting the entire world fall into darkness \nbecause of a single person’s wounded pride, Detective. The stakes are far too \nhigh for that kind of indulgence. \nBASIRA \nSo, what are they doing? \nELIAS \nI don’t know the details. Ny-Ålesund is a stronghold of The Dark, meaning I \ncan’t see inside. I believe they call it the Extinguished Sun, though that’s as \nmuch I know. If Gertrude had a plan for this one, I haven’t found it, which is \nwhy John needs to be... closer to The Eye. If anyone can stop what’s \nhappening, he can. See through the darkness, etcetera. \nBASIRA \nAnd after all this, you want me to just take it on faith and ferry John up to \nNorway? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 135 – Dark Matter \n \n13 \n \nELIAS \nHave you ever seen the Aurora Borealis? It’s lovely this time of year. It would \nbe a shame to lose them. Feel free to do your own research to confirm what \nI’m telling you, just don’t take too long. \nBASIRA \nIf you’re lying about this ... \nELIAS \nYou’ll kill me? I can hardly wait. \nGood luck, Detective. \n[Tape clicks off.] \n[The Magnus Archives Theme – Outro] \nThe Magnus Archives is a podcast distributed by Rusty Quill and licensed under \na Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Sharealike 4.0 International \nlicence. \nToday’s episode was written by Jonathan Sims and directed by Alexander J \nNewall. \nIt featured: Jonathan Sims as The Archivist, Frank Voss as Basira Hussain, and \nBen Meredith as Elias Bouchard.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 6, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 3400}}
