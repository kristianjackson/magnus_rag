For it. \nIt sat there, clearly waiting for me to ask another question, so I did. I asked it \nwhat it wanted, and was told that it wanted to help. \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nHelp? With… what? \n \nSASHA \nThat’s what I said. Did it want to stop Jane Prentiss? It laughed that weird \nlaugh again and told me that I had no idea what was really going on. It didn’t \nsound like it had any intention of telling me, though, it just seemed like it was \namused by my attempts to understand. Then it said it didn’t care if I or my \ncompanions lived or died, but that “the flesh-hive was always rash”. It said it \nwanted to be friends. When it said this it put its hand in mine, and it may have \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG026 – A Distortion \n9 \n \nlooked like a human hand, but it was heavy. It felt like a... wet leather bag full \nof heavy stones. Sharp stones. \nI pulled my hand away quickly and got up to leave. By this point I was just \nabout sick of this weird thing that looked like a person but was not a person \nand talked in riddles. It made no move to stop me as I headed towards the \ndoor. As I was about to exit, though, it called after me, and said if I was \ninterested in saving your life it would be waiting at Hanwell Cemetery. \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nSorry, saving my life? \n \nSASHA \nYeah. It called you by name. You. And Martin. And Tim. \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nThat’s... unsettling. \n \nSASHA \nIt really was. At the time I just tried to ignore it. I went home and I got as much \nsleep as I could. I don’t know if you noticed how tired I was yesterday, what \nwith Tim’s April Fools’ joke. \n \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG026 – A Distortion \n10 \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nDon’t remind me. \n \nSASHA \nWell, I was a bit of a mess. I checked the cafe on the way in, and on the way \nhome. I even went down there on my lunch, but ‘Michael’ wasn’t there. Part of \nme wanted to tell you about it immediately, to make a statement, but even if \nyou believed me I knew you’d try and talk me out of going to Hanwell \nCemetery, and I had just about made my mind up to go. I didn’t know if what \nMichael had said was a threat or a warning or just a lie, but I decided I couldn’t \ntake the chance. So I went to the cemetery. \nThe sun was starting to go down when I got there, and the gates of the \ngraveyard were lit with the bright orange of the dying light. It had been raining \nearlier that day, and the pools of water reflected the vivid colours of the sky. \nHanwell is an old cemetery, and past the walls I could see the weathered old \ngravestones standing silent. As it turned out, I didn’t have to go inside. Michael \nwas waiting for me next to the tall iron gates when I arrived. I caught a glimpse \nof its reflection in one of the deep pools of rainwater, and shuddered as I saw \nagain – the warped body and swollen bony hands. \nIt didn’t say anything when I arrived, just nodded at me to follow. I have no \nidea how long he had stood there waiting for me. I expected to go into the \ngraveyard, but instead Micahael started walking down the road towards a \nnearby row of houses. The sign on the road said Azalea Close. Most of the \nbuildings were in good repair, but there was one at the end that looked \nabandoned.
