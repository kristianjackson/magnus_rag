All the heavy hitters you’d expect on \nthe list: Buddha, Jesus, Muhammad, Ramakrishna - you get the idea. They weren’t \nreincarnations, per se, but the same divine impulse for human elevation \nmanifested in different people. Claude Vilakazi was definitely not claiming to be \nthe Eleventh Link, oh no. But he had had a vision that the Eleventh was soon to be \nborn, and that he was to be their herald and guardian. The actual practices were a \ngrab bag of all sorts of occultism, exactly what you’d expect from a group who laid \nclaim to basically every major religion. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 153 – Love Bombing \n6 \n \nHonestly I don’t know how much I actually believed any of it, but I felt like I \nbelonged there. I sold what little I had in order to fully earn my place in the \ncommunity and I stayed. I had shelter, food, all the companionship I could ask for. \nI spent my days working in the field. We actually produced one of the only \nAmerican rounds of rice-wine, which was how the cult made most of its money. \nAnd it felt good to be working with my hands. When the whole thing collapsed \nthe papers made all sorts of awful claims about the place, but I don’t know if they \nwere wholly made-up, or if they happened the whole time and I just didn’t notice. \nOr if they came about after things started to change. Started to go rotten. \nI wasn’t there when they found the dog. Maybe if I had been, things would have \nbeen different. It was actually Joyce and a few others who stumbled across it \nwhile working the fields. The way they told it, it was thin and emaciated, barely \nable to walk and clearly suffering from some sort of sickness, but there was \nsomething in it that drew them closer. (static builds) As Joyce put it, we couldn’t \nhelp but love it. They took it to Claude, who was just as taken with the thing, and \ndecided to adopt it. He named the dog Agape in front of everyone and took it into \nhis private room to be cared for. That was the last I saw of the thing and… \nhonestly, I kind of forgot about it for the next few weeks. But that was the \nmoment when things started to get really weird. \nClaude announced at evening meal a few days later that he had been dreaming of \nthe Eleventh, and there were going to be some changes to help spiritually prepare \nus for their arrival. We needed to achieve a state of pure love. And to begin with, \nwhat that meant was that whenever we would meet one another or pass each \nother in the corridor or fields, we were to tell each other that we loved them. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 153 – Love Bombing \n7 \n \nAnd, Claude said solemnly, you have to mean it. At the time it didn’t seem so \nsinister and we all began to do it without question, until a week later when I \nbumped into Mary outside the showers. \nI told her I loved her and began to walk on, when her arm shot out and grabbed \nme by the shoulder. She spun me to face her and looked me dead in the eye. \n“I don’t believe you,” she said. \nI mean, she was right. She and I had never really got on, just two different \npersonalities, but in that moment I was suddenly terrified of what might happen if \nshe thought I was lying about it. So I said it again, and I tried very hard to mean it. \nHer eyes bored into me and I noticed that they were yellow and sickly, like she \nhad really bad jaundice. And she nodded once, turned, and left. \nIt was about that time that the rice wine started to go bad. Every batch we \nbrewed came out cloudy and undrinkable. We couldn’t figure out what was going \non. I spent so long cleaning every piece of equipment over and over again, but it \njust kept happening. When we raised it with Claude or any of the others in the \ninner circle they would nod understandingly, then tell us it didn’t matter, that it \nwas no longer our concern now that the Eleventh was so close. All the others \nseemed to accept this without question, and I didn’t feel I could press the matter \nwithout drawing negative attention, something I was desperate to avoid doing. So \nI just sat there as it grew bitter, cloudy, and rancid. Nobody bothered to get rid of \nthe wine and the smell gradually began to permeate through the building. \nThose closest to Claude began to change as well.
