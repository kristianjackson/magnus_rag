You look like a mummy. You need rest. \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nOur friends in the hazmat suits gave me a clean bill of health, \nbloody holes notwithstanding. And they seemed quite keen to \nquarantine anyone showing even the slightest sign of infection. It’s \njust pain. \nELIAS \nThe paramedics said your lungs need fresh air. Tim’s as well. \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nIt’s fresh enough down here. \n \nELIAS \nA basement filled with a thousand rotting worm carcasses? Surely \nwe could do this in my office? \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nNo. I need to be here. Keep watch. I need to be sure... \n \n \nELIAS \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG040 – Human Remains \n3 \n \nJohn! She’s gone. I went with the ECDC people when they took her \naway. I watched her body burn. Jane Prentiss is dead. You can \nrelax. \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nYou know why I can’t. When Martin found... \n \nELIAS \nThat’s a matter for the police. \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nFine! Fine. I’ll go home as soon as I have everyone’s statements. \n \nELIAS \nVery well. \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nStatement of Elias Bouchard, Head of the Magnus Institute, \nregarding the... infestation by the entity formerly known as Jane \nPrentiss. Statement recorded direct from subject, 29th July 2016. \nWhenever you’re ready. \nELIAS \nThere isn’t a lot to tell for my part. This afternoon, just after lunch, I \nwas going over some budgets in my office, as I normally do on a \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG040 – Human Remains \n4 \n \nTuesday, when the fire alarm started going off. It was annoying, but \nnot too worrying at first. I packed my work away, and began to \ncalmly head towards the evacuation point, when Sasha came \nbarrelling through the door, babbling about worms, and clutching a \ntape recorder. \nI told her that whatever was wrong should wait until we were out of \nthe building, as there may be a fire. She told me she had set off the \nfire alarm to get everyone out, and that you and Martin and Tim \nwere currently trapped by Jane Prentiss. Obviously this got my \nattention, and I suggested she turn the tape recorder on, largely so \nthis sort of debrief wouldn’t be necessary. Did you not get the \ntape? \nJONATHAN SIMS \nNo. There was… some sort of problem. Sasha tells me the tape was \nlost. \nELIAS \nHmm Well, I explained to her about the recently installed fire \nsuppression system, and said that, as there was no actual fire, we’d \nneed to activate it manually. We hurried down, and it was clear \neveryone else had already evacuated. We… had reached the \nground floor when… well… \nI… know I have often seemed dismissive of your concerns before, \nand in fact I was getting ready to raise the issue of Martin’s \ncontinuing to live in the Institute’s basement, especially as I believe \nhe’s been stealing fire extinguishers. But… honestly, I didn’t fully \nappreciate what you’d been talking about until I turned that corner \nand we saw what I can only describe as a… a tidal wave of filth \nrushing towards us. I feel somewhat ashamed to admit I didn’t", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 0, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 3634}}
