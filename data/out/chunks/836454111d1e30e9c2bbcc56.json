Most of the space \nwas taken up by a large oak desk and I could see another door leading through \nto what seemed to be a workshop, judging by the tables and bags of sawdust. \nDaniel handed me his account books, bank records and receipts and left me to \nit. None of it had been digitised and I could tell it was going to take me a long \ntime to get through it all. The smell was fainter here though, so it wasn’t quite \nas dreadful as it might have been. \nThere was taxidermy in this room as well, though different to the ones out \nfront. Hung along the back walls were pelts and treated animal skins. They \nlooked very old. Some I recognised as Native American or African in origin, and \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 054 – Still Life \n8 \n \none seemed so old I was worried to even breathe near it in case it collapsed \ninto dust. On top of the desk, pressed up against the wall, was a mounted hare \nin a small waistcoat. It reminded me of the white rabbit from Alice in \nWonderland, although its fur was faded and now stained a faint yellow. I found \nits face a bit more unsettling than the others, though I couldn’t tell you why, \nand I tried not to look too closely at it as I went through the shop’s records. \nIt didn’t look like there was any money laundering go on, which was a relief. \nThe prices that people were occasionally paying for the stuffed creatures were \nvery high, but I’m by no means an expert on the industry and there didn’t \nseem to be anything else suspicious in the books. I did wonder the sort of \npeople he was selling to though. From the back room, I watched four \ncustomers enter over the course of the day. In each case, I watched as they got \nmore and more unnerved, before finally fleeing back out the door, trying to \nrationalise their fear. I sympathised. \nIt was almost closing time when Daniel came back to check on me. I gave him \nthe good news; he didn’t seem particularly relieved, but told me he was glad to \nhear it. Then he laughed and asked if I knew how honoured I was. I didn’t \nunderstand. He told me that I was sat here among some of the oldest skin in \nthe world. That was how he phrased it. It put me a bit on edge and I cast a \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 054 – Still Life \n9 \n \nnervous glance towards the workshop, before reminding myself that I was \nkeeping an open mind about his strange profession. \nDaniel started to go through the pieces on display: buffalo skin from North \nAmerica; Jaguar from the south; a wonderful pelt from the early Middle Ages. \nThe hare, he said, had been part of the Great Exhibition of 1851 and had \nhelped drive Victorian England mad for the craft. I didn’t like the emphasis he \nput on mad when he said that. Finally, he pointed to the oldest of the pelts. He \ntold me it was gorilla skin from Carthage, brought by Hanno in the 5th century \nBC, and that it might just be the oldest piece of taxidermy in the world. To be \nhonest, I didn’t believe him. Even if a gorilla’s hide could be preserved for more \nthan two millennia, it seemed an unlikely thing to be found in the back of a \nshop in Barnet. It was clearly very old though and I didn’t challenge him on it. \nI was just about to make my excuses and go, when the bell rang out at the \nfront of the shop and a pair of obnoxious Cockney voices started to call out for \nDaniel. His face went blank at this and he asked me to excuse him one second, \nabruptly leaving me in the back room alone. I heard the men say something \nabout unloading a van and then the bell rang again, taking Daniel with it. I was \nalone.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 3, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 3565}}
