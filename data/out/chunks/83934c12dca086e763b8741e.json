This \nwas a couple of years after my mother’s disappearance, and I must have been \nabout ten. The phone in the kitchen started ringing and my father was upstairs. \nI had recently received permission from my father to answer the phone, so I \nwas excited to take up my new responsibility. I picked up the handset and said \nmy memorised phone script into the receiver: “Hello, Montauk residence!” A \nman’s voice asked to speak with my father. It was a breathy voice, like that of \nan old man, and at the time I decided he had a German accent, though, when I \nwas young a lot of different nationalities and accents were lumped together in \nmy mind under the label “German”. “What is this regarding?” I asked, as I had \na whole phone conversation memorised and wanted to use as much of it as \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG009 – A Father’s Love \n8 \n \npossible. The man sounded surprised at this and said hesitantly that he was \nfrom my father’s work. I asked him if he was from the Police and after a pause, \nhe said “Yes”. He asked me to tell my father that it was Detective Rayner on \nthe line with a new case for him. \nAt this point my father had come down to the kitchen to see who was calling. I \ntold him and he visibly paled. He took the handset from me and placed it to his \near, not speaking but listening very intently. After a moment, he told me to go \nup to my room as this was a “grown-up” conversation. I turned to leave, but as \nI was heading up the stairs the light bulb in the landing blew. The bulbs in our \nhouse broke often – my father said we had faulty wiring – so even at that age I \nwas quite adept at changing them. So I turned around and headed back \ndownstairs to fetch a new bulb. As I approached the cabinet where we kept \nthem, I heard my father’s voice from the kitchen. He was still on the phone and \nhe sounded angry. I heard him say “No, not already. Do it yourself.” Then he \nwent very quiet and listened, before finally he said okay, that he’d do it as soon \nas possible. He put down the phone, then went over to the cupboard and \npoured himself a drink. He spent the rest of the day in the shed. \nThe one question they kept asking me over and over during the investigation \ninto my father was whether I knew where the rest of the bodies were. I told \nthem the truth, that I had no idea. They claimed they wanted to confirm the \nidentities of the victims, which they couldn’t easily do with what was left. I \ndidn’t know where the bodies were, but I also didn’t tell them of the other way \nthey might have identified the victims: my father’s photographs. I didn’t say \nanything because I had no idea where he kept them and I thought it would \nonly make things worse if they couldn’t find them, but, yes, my father took \nphotographs.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 4, "chunk_count": 10, "chars": 2844}}
