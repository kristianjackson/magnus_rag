It was only in the last few months, when our \nhosts were being pressed by the Russians, and resources became scarce, then \nwe suffered. But this is not what I care to dwell on. It was what happened after \nwe were released that brings me to tell you my story. \nYou cannot imagine the chaos immediately after the war was lost. Unlike \nGermany, carved up between East and West, Italy’s division was… messier. \nThere was the South, that had had surrendered with the King in 1943, and the \nNorth, occupied by the Germans for the most part, but some of our forces had \nstill fought alongside them in Mussolini’s puppet state. To give you some idea \n\nof what I was returning home to after the war: Il Duce died in April of ‘45 and \nthe Germans surrendered in May, but the official peace treaty between Italy \nand the Allies was not be signed until 1947. The country was split, divided and \nbleeding. There was ‘interim government’ and ‘moves to restore order’, but \nnobody really knew what was going on. There was no debriefing, no official \nresponse to our release; I didn’t even know I was part of a military that still \nexisted. I had to make my own way back to my home near Teramo, walking, \nhiding and riding in whatever vehicle had a driver who took pity on me. \nI don’t know what I expected to find when I finally arrived home. Whatever it \nwas, it wasn’t my old Alpini comrades, uniforms torn and fading, preparing \nwhat weapons and equipment they could find for an expedition into the \nmountains. My home was in the foothills of the Appennino Centrale, and many \nof the men I served with I had known since childhood. I was glad to see them \nalive, and they greeted me with smiles and open arms, but there was \nsomething tight about their faces that filled me with a faint dread. \nI asked what they were doing, and their eyes fell to their guns. Deserters, I was \ntold, in the mountains. Attacking people, and stealing from nearby villages. We \nwere going to find them, and take care of them. I started to protest, sure there \nmust be others better suited to the task, but even before I spoke I knew this \nwasn’t true. Instead I asked if the deserters knew the war was over; it was \nlikely they no longer needed to hide. Again, a shake of the head, and there was \nquiet for a few seconds. It was Antonio Cannavaro, one of my oldest friends, \nwho finally spoke up. \nThe deserters, he said, had gone rotten. Not mad, or desperate. Rotten. Sono \nandanti marcio. \n\nI suppose I could have left them to it. Turned my back on them, and tried to \nleave my war far behind me. But I don’t think that was ever really an option. I \ntold them I was coming, and Antonio nodded his head. There was no joy in the \nmovement. He was a huge bear of a man, was Antonio, but I saw his hands \nshaking as he checked his weapon yet again. \nMy father served his King in the Great War. He told me tales afterwards, \nstories of courage and heroism, of men fighting for the glory of their country. I \nnow know these stories were lies. But when he was drunk, as he was more and \nmore towards the end, he told other stories. Stories that didn’t always make \nsense. Once or twice he had talked to me about the ‘wild deserters’. These \nmen, he had said, had fled from their units, but rather than trying to escape \nbehind the lines, where they might be caught and shot, they would run into \nthe battlefields, into no man’s land, and tunnel under the mud and carnage. \nThey lived down there, so he said, desperate, ragged and barely human. At \nnight you could hear them creeping around the battlefields, stealing what they \ncould, and dragging the bodies of the dead down into their dens. If you were \nquiet, my father would say with a shudder, you could hear them eating. \nI didn’t mention these stories to my companions as we started to trek up the \nslopes of Monte Vettore. They clearly had enough on their minds, eyes \nnarrowed against the glare and mouths pressed tight. We didn’t talk about the \nwar. There was no question I could have asked that did not risk breaking the \nfragile solidarity of our small band, but as I walked alongside them, I knew that \neach of them was dwelling on ghosts and stories of their own. \nThe first sign we saw of our quarry was a thin column of smoke ahead of us, \nclear against the deep blue sky. It was a mountain cabin, not uncommon in \nthese parts, with a well-built chimney stack gently announcing its warmth. In", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 1, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 4481}}
