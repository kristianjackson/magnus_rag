The whites of his eyes are riddled with the scarlet veins of sleeplessness, \nbut his hand trembles with a feverish energy as he tries to explain the \nsignificance of the book he’s found. Even sober, Elias couldn't have followed \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 193 – A Stern Look \n \n13 \nwhat his friend was saying, lost in layers of theological scholarship, but he \nsmiles anyway to see the reserved young Allan so passionate about his subject. \nHe looks at the book itself. It’s old, crumbling, with none of the usual college \nlibrary markings. He asks Allan where he got it, and his friend doesn’t answer, \ninstead glancing around with a sudden self-conscious suspicion. \n[Shuffling and page flicking sounds] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nElias shuffles round to get a closer look at the pages, then stops in confusion, \nas he realises they are all blank. Allan only laughs when he says so. Was the \nlaughter really that cruel? Or is it just the warping of memory, the past he tries \nto forget, mixed with the nightmares that came after, the faces he dreamed of \nseeing in those pages. \n[Sounds from the memory end; replaced with Elias’ office \nclock ticking] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \n“Well, er…” Elias is shaking all over. “That is to say...” \n[Elias’ ticking clock is replaced with the rapidly ticking clock from \nprevious and muffled urban car and people noises] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nAnother one. Allan is curled up behind the sofa in the living room they share. \nElias stares at his weeping friend, bleary-eyed, trying to follow his housemate’s \nstrange monologue, half-confession, half-conspiracy theory, half-urban legend. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 193 – A Stern Look \n \n14 \n[A cigarette lighter strikes a few times, with puffed inhales; a \nsolitary fly buzzes about] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \n“It saw me,” Allan keeps saying, over and over again, “It saw me through the \npages. And it’s coming.” He sees it, he says, in every mirror, every distant \ndoorway, a silhouette on every skyline. Coming closer each and every time, \nfinding its way towards him, step by step. “It has no eyes,” Allan sobs, “so it \nhas to feel its way towards me. But it knows. It knows!” Elias has no way to \ncomfort him. He can’t even understand what he’s talking about. \n[A few more lighter flicks] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nAnd so on that, the last night of Allan Schreiber’s life, he just gets him high, and \nleaves him to sleep it off. \n[Sounds from the memory end; replaced with Elias’ office \nclock ticking] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \n“I... don’t know,” Elias says at last. “You can never really be sure, can you?” \nBeyond that stretch of polished mahogany, so well waxed that Elias’ pale, \nsweating face is clearly visible, James Wright’s smile remains unchanged. \nJONAH/ELIAS \nWho indeed?
