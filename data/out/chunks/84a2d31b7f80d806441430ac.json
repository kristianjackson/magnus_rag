Pest Control. \n[The Magnus Archives Theme – Intro Continued] \n[Tape clicks on.] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 055 – Pest Control \n \n2 \n \nARCHIVIST \nSay it again please. \nJORDAN \nExcuse me? \nARCHIVIST \nWhat you just said. Can you say it again, so I have it on tape? \nJORDAN \nUh, okay, Jane Prentiss is dead. \nARCHIVIST \nYou’re sure? Completely? \nJORDAN \nYeah, I watched the incineration. \nARCHIVIST \nAnd there were no complications? \nJORDAN \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 055 – Pest Control \n \n3 \n \nLike what? \nARCHIVIST \nSurviving worms that escaped. Movement from the body during incineration. \nNoises from it, like screams or chanting. Weird feelings like a thousand tiny \ncrawling things are moving across your skin. \nJORDAN \nWow. No, nothing like that. Just the smell, but I mean, I’ll get to that. It went \nwell. Nothing left but the ashes I gave to your friend. Which I shouldn’t have, \nby the way, so keep it to yourself. \nARCHIVIST \nOf course. And thank you. \nJORDAN \nSure. \nARCHIVIST \nIt’s been months though. Why are you just looking to make your statement \nnow? \nJORDAN \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 055 – Pest Control \n \n4 \n \nUh, it’s not really... it’s not just burning her body. I was also the one that was \nfirst called in to deal with the nest in her old apartment. \nARCHIVIST \nOh. \nJORDAN \nYeah, but there are a few things I’ve been thinking about. Putting some pieces \ntogether and I thought, well, you guys should probably know. \nARCHIVIST \nRight. Well, start from the beginning, wherever you feel... comfortable. \nStatement of Jordan Kennedy regarding... \nJORDAN \nSeveral weird things I’ve found while working in pest control. \nARCHIVIST \nStatement taken direct from subject, 3rd November 2016. Statement begins. \nJORDAN (STATEMENT) \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 055 – Pest Control \n \n5 \n \nI’ve worked as an exterminator for the better part of ten years now. I should \nsay ‘pest controller’ really. The BPCA generally advise against using the E word. \nThey feel it sounds a bit too unpleasant, harms our public image. I’ve never \nreally minded. I mean, I guess I could say killing things is sort of exerting \ncontrol over them, but I’ve always felt that trying to sanitise my job is \nsomehow a bit dishonest. Like trying to help people forget that what they’re \nactually doing is commissioning the deaths of creatures which we’ve deemed \ntoo disgusting or unhealthy to live. It needs doing, don’t get me wrong, and I’m \nhappy enough to do it. But it isn’t my job to hold people’s hands and make \nthem feel better about it. \nI’ve done places all over London, mainly big commercial buildings where I have \nto work at night, while all the bankers and the like have gone home. Setting \ntraps, putting down poison boxes, the usual. Residential homes don’t call me \nout quite so much for rats and mice, especially if it’s a rental place. Most \nlandlords don’t bother paying out for that sort of thing or try to deal with it \nthemselves. You get a lot of calls about bedbugs though. Those little bastards \nare a devil to get rid of, and of course, come summer, we have to deal with \nplenty of wasps’ nests. Sprinkle a generous handful of cockroaches, ants and \noccasionally even birds or foxes, and you have a pretty good idea of what my \nworking life consists of.
