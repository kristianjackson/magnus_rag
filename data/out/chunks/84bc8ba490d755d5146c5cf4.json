Not to sound like a squeaky hinge— \n(Annoyed sigh from the Archivist) \n—but do try to lighten up. Don’t get me wrong, the brooding thing’s a good \nlook on you, but it is starting to get a bit tired. Especially now you’ve got \nsomeone else to do the intense, driven thing. I think you might need to get a \nnew schtick. \nARCHIVIST \n(Sarcastic) Thank you for the feedback. I’ll try to bear it in mind. \nHELEN \nIt’s all I ask! Anyway, I should be off. Don’t want to be late for rounds. Ciao! \n[Footsteps head off] \n[The high-pitched tone ends] \nMARTIN \n(Sighs) Is it me or is she getting worse? I think I preferred it when she wasn't \nquite so...
