I mean, I’m not a fast reader or anything, \nbut that’s a lot, right? And, like … Ok, so this is the part that you’re definitely \ngoing to think I’m having a joke with you, but I’m honestly not. I’m dead \nserious. Cos I saw some of the pages over his shoulder, and on one of them, \nthere was ... There was a picture of me, like a black and white photo of my \nface. I didn’t get a good look, but it certainly wasn’t one that I remember \nhaving had taken, not that that would make it any less weird for it to be \nprinted in an old CCTV manual from back when I was still in nappies. But I’m \nnot making it up, I swear. Then Samson turned and looked at me and, I don’t \nknow, I got real spooked. His eyes were all messed up, like weird and glassy. It \nwas really, really freaky, and I just turned and I got out of there. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 148 – Extended Surveillance \n \n16 \n \nThat wasn’t the end of it, though.

And \nwhenever I was there late and it was my turn to close up, he’d always say that \nhe was happy to do it, say I could head off a few minutes early, so I never \nactually saw him leave.

And I got this feeling, deep in my gut, that if that last \nmonitor turned off, then something really bad was going to happen to me. It \nwas one of the old CRT sets, big and bulky, and the picture on it was never that \nclear, but for a moment, it looked like it was me on there, staring right back at \nmyself as the screens slowly went black, getting closer and closer.

I used to get my lunch, for one, \nand usually pick up any of the essentials I needed.
