Perhaps this was the street \nmarket Ethan had mentioned? I stumbled out into it and began to look around. \nI couldn’t see any stalls, or shops, or anything that might explain the presence \nof so many people, but I didn’t have time to really think about it before they \nstarted bumping into me. It didn’t seem deliberate, but there were so many \npeople, far more than I had thought at first, and they couldn’t move without \njostling or pushing me. \n \nThe flow of people dragged me this way and that. I was surrounded that by \nthat noise, that mumbling noise of the crowd. Now I was inside it though, I \nrealised it wasn’t Italian being spoken, or English, or any other language I \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG048 – Lost in The Crowd \n9 \n \nrecognised. The more I listened, the more I realised it, it wasn’t a language. \nThere were no words, it was just noise. Just a noise being made by the people \naround me. Then I started to focus on those people and that’s when I began to \nscream. \n \nTheir faces were a blur, each and every one of them. It was like someone had \nrecorded them screaming or having a seizure and then played it back at a \nhundred times the speed on their face. None of them had hair, or any \ndistinguishing marks, and though their clothes were different, they were all \ndifferent versions of the same clothes. I, I tried to talk to them or to shout, to \nscream at them, but there was no reaction. I tried to push, to punch, or kick \nthem, but they were pressed in too tight and I couldn’t do anything except get \nbuffeted this way and that by them. This crowd of people, they weren’t \npeople. It was just a crowd. A crowd without any people in it and I was still \ncompletely alone. \n \nIt was then, as I felt my grip begin to slide, and I worried that I would lose \nmyself to the crowd forever, that the words of that strange man in the coffee \nshop came to my mind. Think of your mother. And I did. I thought of her face, \nthe smell of her perfume, the long rambling phone calls made whenever we \ngot the chance. I closed my eyes and remembered in as much detail, and with \nas much love as I could muster in my despair. \n \nI didn’t notice when the bodies around me stopped pushing or when the \ndroning sound of the crowd stopped. Eventually I opened my eyes again. It was \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG048 – Lost in The Crowd \n10 \n \nnight and I was on a street I didn’t recognise, with an old Italian couple staring \nat me like I had gone mad. It took me another hour to find my way back to the \nhostel, and I made sure I was always in sight of at least one other person. \n \nI didn’t search for Ethan any further. I had as much of an answer as I was going \nto get and left his backpack in the hostel, in case he ever made it back to \ncollect. I doubt he did. I cut my travels short after that, came back home by as \ndirect a route as I could and spent some time at my mother’s house. I haven’t \nbeen travelling since, but I have some time off coming up and would like to \nhead out again. I might see if I can find a friend to go with me though. I think it \nmight be a while before I’m ready to travel on my own again. \nJONATHAN SIMS \nStatement ends. \nAn interesting encounter, though difficult to follow up, given its location. Sasha \narranged a supplementary interview with Ms Nunis, who reports she has \nrecently started travelling alone again and has not had any further problems. \nMartin has confirmed that over the last decade there have been several \ntravellers reported missing in Genoa, but averaged out, no more than is normal \nfor a city of its size. I don’t quite know whether this means few travellers go \nmissing in Genoa, or that a lot of travellers go missing everywhere else. \nI’m curious about this coffee shop stranger Ms Nunis met. His description puts \nme in mind of Gerard Keay, though there isn’t much to it. If it is him, then he \nmust have taken this trip shortly after he was acquitted of his mother’s \nmurder. Fleeing the country for a while, perhaps? Maybe there were rumours", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 4, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 4034}}
