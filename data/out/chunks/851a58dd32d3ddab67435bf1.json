Yes, \nI did want him dead. And more than that, I wanted him to suffer. Angela smiled \nwhen I said that, a warm smile that suited her round face, and said that that \nwouldn’t be a problem. I started to explain the situation, but she waved it \naway and told me that Toby had filled her in on all the details, and that there \nwas just one thing she needed from me, that he couldn’t provide. I started to \ntell her that I wasn’t paying for someone’s gran to take out a hard case like \nNoriega, but she said no, she wasn’t after money. She said that she was “well-\ncompensated” for the service she provided and that all she needed from me \nwas an object, anything that I had taken from Noriega. Not a gift, she said, \nstaring into my eyes with a look that I recognised from years of working with \nvery unpleasant people. It wouldn’t work if it was a gift. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG014 – Piecemeal \n6 \n \nAt this point I was starting to feel uneasy. Not scared, alright, I wasn’t scared of \nthis old woman, but being around her was... bad. I don’t know how else to say \nit, she was bad. You’ve got to understand, I know dangerous, I understand \ndangerous, hell, I am dangerous. This was something else. But I wanted Paul \nNoriega dead so badly. Five years ago, just before we’d been picked up by the \npolice I’d borrowed his lighter. It was a battered old Zippo, used to have a \npicture of a topless woman on it, but now that was almost worn away. After he \nturned on me in questioning, I didn’t feel much like returning it to the \ntreacherous backstabber, so I held on to it. I hadn’t thought much of it, but \nhere it was, still in the pocket of my jacket, all those years later. I handed it to \nAngela, and she gave me that look again, and told me that it would work just \nfine. \nAnd then we left. Angela told us not to worry about it, that Paul Noriega wasn’t \ngoing to be bothering us for much longer; we just had to wait until she was \nfinished. Finished with what exactly, she didn’t say, she didn’t need to. We \nknew whatever it was we were probably better off not knowing. \nThe waiting came hard, though. After he’d had me roughed up, it seemed like \nNoriega had decided I wasn’t worth worrying about. I’d see him walking those \nstreets like he owned them, his pair of legbreakers in tow, and I knew there \nwas nothing that I could do about it. He knew it too. So I waited. And I waited. I \nwaited for the shot, or the knife, or the poison or the… whatever would end \nhim for good. It never came. Days turned into weeks and there he still was, as \ncocksure as ever. \nI was patient. God, I was patient, but after three weeks I had almost written off \nthat useless old bag as a time-wasting con job. I was going to give her one \nmore week, just one, but then something came up that I couldn’t ignore. Word", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 3, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 2813}}
