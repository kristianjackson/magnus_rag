They’ve knocked \nthrough most of the middle, hollowed it out, made a sort of auditorium. \n \nBASIRA \nHow big? \n \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG118 – The Masquerade \n \n14 \n \nARCHIVIST \nI don’t know, big. \n \nBASIRA \n I mean, it’s not a huge building. \n \nARCHIVIST \nI don’t know. Tonight was my first time seeing it from the outside, at least in \nthe, uh, flesh. I guess it does seem... smaller? \n \nBASIRA \nYou’re sure this is the right place? \n \nTIM \nI am. \n \nARCHIVIST \nThis is definitely where they kept me, although I don’t remember quite this \nmany waxworks... \n \nBASIRA \nAlright. Just don’t want to get this far just to find we’re in the … \n \n(Calliope chords start) \n \nARCHIVIST \nThis is the place. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG118 – The Masquerade \n \n15 \n \n \nTIM \nWe need to see what’s going on in there. \n \nARCHIVIST \nJust ignore it. We have a job to do— \n \nBASIRA \nJesus! \n \nDAISY \nWhat? \n \nBASIRA \nIt moved. \n \nARCHIVIST \nRight, okay, if they’re starting to— We’ve got to go. \n \nBASIRA \nNo, like, just... It was just, like a, a flicker in his eyes. Look at this. \n \nARCHIVIST \nIf waxworks are coming alive, we need to go. \n \nBASIRA \nJust shut up and look. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG118 – The Masquerade \n \n16 \n \n \nDAISY \nHuh. \n \nARCHIVIST \nOh God. \n \nOh God, they’re not waxworks. \n \nTIM \nWhat do you— Christ. \n \nARCHIVIST \nTim, I think— I think maybe we had better see what’s going on in there. \n \nTIM \nAlright. On three... Three! \n \n(Door opens and the calliope music gets more intense and weird atonal \nsinging begins to filter through) \n \nTIM \nHoly... \n \nARCHIVIST \n(Awed) Yes. I suppose it is. \n \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG118 – The Masquerade \n \n17 \n \nDAISY \nDone. \n \nARCHIVIST \nI, um... I think we might need all of it, Daisy. The place is, uh, it’s bigger than \nwe thought. \n \nDAISY \n(Looks over, snorts) Roger that. Give me a couple of minutes. \n \nARCHIVIST \nS-sooner would be better. \n \nTIM \nWhat is it? \n \nARCHIVIST \nFear fuels everything; of course they’d need it for a grand ritual. \n \nBASIRA \nWhat the hell is that thing? What’s it doing to them? \n \nARCHIVIST \nI think... I used to call it the Anglerfish. It’s... I knew it took the skin, used it to \ncoat people made of sawdust and stuffing, but... I suppose I thought it just... \nate the rest. But no. It had a museum to fill with waxworks. And I guess you \ndon’t need skin to sing, to join the choir. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG118 – The Masquerade \n \n18 \n \n \n(The music intensifies) \n \n(Click) \n \n(Click) \n \nMARTIN \n(Bitter laugh) Sorry, looks like it wants to know what’s going on. \n \nELIAS \nHm. A pity. You know John listens to all of them? \n \nMARTIN \nWhat? You don’t want him hearing your big evil speech? \n \nELIAS \nJust wanted to spare you the small amount of dignity you have left. \n \nMARTIN \nDignity!? Right, yeah. Like the dignity of being trapped in your flat by worms or \nsleeping in the archives clutching a corkscrew? Or-or fetching drinks for the \nthing that murdered your friend without you even noticing, laughing at their all \ntheir little jokes then being left to wander impossible corridors for weeks!? \n \nELIAS \nAre you done? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG118 – The Masquerade \n \n19 \n \n \nMARTIN \nNot even close, because I’ve... I’ve been thinking. It’s not like you got this \nwhole all-seeing thing recently; you’ve had it the whole time. I remember the \nway you looked at Sasha after the attack. You knew it wasn’t her. And I reckon \nyou knew Prentiss was lurking under the Institute too. And you did nothing. \nWhy? \n \n… \n \n(Shouting) Why? \n \nELIAS \nLet’s just get this over with, shall we? \n \nMARTIN \nWhat, like with Melanie? Just that perfect bit of information to leave me a \nwreck? \n \nELIAS \nYes. \n \nMARTIN \nWell, I hope you’ve got something better than that pathetic dig at my feelings \nfor John. \n \nELIAS", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 2, "chunk_count": 5, "chars": 3798}}
