But we don’t go out much \nanymore. \nARCHIVIST \n“Usually”? \nBASIRA \nYeah. \nARCHIVIST \nYou were attacked. When? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 123 - Web Development \n7 \n \nBASIRA \nAbout two months ago. It was, uh… It was The Flesh. \nARCHIVIST \nOh God. \nBASIRA \nYeah. It was bad. We took them all out. Melanie did most of them. She was… \nShe got a knife from somewhere and— \nARCHIVIST \nBasira, I… I don’t know if that’s a good sign. \nBASIRA \nShe saved my life, John. She saved all of us. I won’t forget that. \nARCHIVIST \nFine. Fine. \nHaven’t seen Martin about yet? \nBASIRA \nYeah, he comes and goes. He’s busy. Well, he seems it. \nARCHIVIST \nWorking for Peter Lukas. \nBASIRA \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 123 - Web Development \n8 \n \nDon’t be too hard on him, John. Your, uh, ‘situation’, it hit him. Hard. \nARCHIVIST \n(Sighs) Yes, well, I’m sure there are better ways to deal with it than getting \ncosy with Elias’ successor. Who I’ve yet to meet, by the way. \nBASIRA \n(Small laugh) Join the club. \nARCHIVIST \nSorry, you haven’t— \nBASIRA \nNope. Never seen him. Far as I can tell, Martin’s the only one who has. \nARCHIVIST \nRight. A-And you’re sure he’s… real? \nBASIRA \nWe get emails from him. Memos. \n(Archivist chuckles in disbelief) \nBASIRA (Continued) \nHe’s been restructuring, separating out the departments a bit. Not a surprise, I \nguess, with his pedigree. \nARCHIVIST \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 123 - Web Development \n9 \n \nBut i-if you never see him, I mean... \nBASIRA \nRumour is a couple of researchers up on the third floor decided to ignore some \nof his new directives, and… whoosh. \nARCHIVIST \nSorry, what’s, “whoosh”? \nBASIRA \nWhoosh. Gone. \nARCHIVIST \nOh. (Chuckles bitterly) The more things change... So, we’re under siege, \nMelanie is aggressively unstable, Martin is working very closely with The \nLonely, who is, predictably enough, isolating him. And, oh yes, uh, Tim and \nDaisy are still dead, which is at least easy to keep track of. \nBASIRA \nThat isn’t funny, John. \n \nARCHIVIST \n(Snapping) I know it’s not— \nSorry. It’s just— It’s a lot. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 123 - Web Development \n10 \n \nAnd we’ve got an audience. Perfect. I thought you said you’d decided to throw \nthem all out? \nBASIRA \nYup. And I did. And here’s another one. \nARCHIVIST \nMaybe it’s hungry? \nBASIRA \nSeriously? \nARCHIVIST \nI mean, I did have a statement I was planning to record. \nBASIRA \nGreat. Perfect. You can get on with that and I’ll just leave, then. \nARCHIVIST \nRight, uh, what do I do if Melanie comes back? \nBASIRA \nI don’t know. Play dead? \n[Door opens] \nARCHIVIST \nRight. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 123 - Web Development \n11 \n \n[Door closes] \n(Softly) Thank you. \n[Papers rustle] \nStatement of Angie Santos, regarding a website developed by one Gregory \nCox. Original statement given 1st August 2015. Audio recording by Jonathan \nSims, the Archivist. \nStatement begins. \nARCHIVIST (STATEMENT) \nOkay, for this to make any real kind of sense, you sort of need to know Greg, or \nat least understand how he works. Don’t misunderstand me, please, I’m very \nfond of the man, but I have never in my life encountered anyone quite so \npassive, so willing to go along with whatever situation he finds himself in. No \nmatter how awkward or uncomfortable he might be, he just seems to accept \nhis position. \nActually, now I think about it, it’s more that his being uncomfortable actually \nmakes him more likely to dig in, to double down on whatever’s happening, as if \nincreasing his investment in a thing will somehow make it easier to endure. \nTo give you an example, I first met him about seven years ago, when he was \ntwenty-six. At that point, he’d just got out of his first real relationship, and it \nwas one that had lasted nearly a decade, but to hear him talk about it, it \nsounded like he’d never actually been happy. I mean, it didn’t even sound like \nhappiness was a consideration for him when thinking about it. For the last four \nyears of the relationship, she had just treated him worse and worse, taken", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 1, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 4025}}
