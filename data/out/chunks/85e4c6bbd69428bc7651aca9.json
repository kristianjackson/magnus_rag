The clue is in the \nname. \nMARTIN \nYes, alright. \nARCHIVIST \nJust be glad that this is one of the domains that actually has ground to walk on. \nMARTIN \nWhatever. \n(Beat) \n[A thunderous earth-quaking boom from some distance away] \nMARTIN (CONT'D) \nS-so how far are we from the other side? And-and don't say time and space \ndon't work here; that's a cop-out and you know it. \n(The Archivist sighs) \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 174 – The Great Beast \n9 \nARCHIVIST \nFine. (smug) Three days. \nMARTIN \n(Immediate) Thank you! \n(Beat) \nMARTIN \nWait. Wait, what counts as a day? \nARCHIVIST \n(Amused) What an excellent question. \nMARTIN \n(Under breath) Oh my god— (normal) You can be infuriating sometimes, you \nknow that? \nARCHIVIST \nYes. \nMARTIN \nFine! Fine. How ‘bout Simon, how close are we to him? \nARCHIVIST \n[Hissing static starts] \nUm... Close, but he's able to move a lot faster than we are in this place. \n[Hissing static ends] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 174 – The Great Beast \n10 \nMARTIN \nMeaning...? \nARCHIVIST \nMeaning I know where he is, but, if he doesn't want us to reach him, I don't \nknow if we'll have much of a chance. \nMARTIN \nSo, so what, we're just going to trust him to (slight laugh) show up to his own \nexecution— \n[Martin is cut off by a fast whooshing sound followed by the sound \nof brick and rock destruction; this is Simon Fairchild landing at \nspeed in front of them, somewhat explosively] \n(Martin and the Archivist give a short yell of surprise) \nMARTIN \nJesus! \n(A short laugh) \nARCHIVIST \n(Surprised) Uh... apparently! \nSIMON FAIRCHILD \nHello! \n(Simon makes a pained sound) \n[The sound of rubble as Simon pulls himself up out of the ground] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 174 – The Great Beast \n11 \nSIMON (CONT'D) \nHello, dreadfully sorry! \n(Simon makes another pained sound) \nI only just noticed you were both here! That's the problem with having such a \nbig place, you know, you can miss things if you're not careful. \nARCHIVIST \nUh-h. Right. \n(Martin makes a small shocked noise) \nSIMON \nGood to see you again, Martin! And you must be the famous Archivist. Herald \nof the Ceaseless Watcher, Harbinger of the New Age, etcetera. Lovely to meet \nyou at last. \n(Small exhale from Archivist) \nSimon Fairchild, at your service. \nARCHIVIST \nI know who you are. \nSIMON \n(Laughing) Of course you do. I imagine you know pretty much everything by \nthis point. How is it? How does it feel? \nARCHIVIST \nStrange. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 174 – The Great Beast \n12 \nSIMON \nYes. I can imagine! These gifts can feel very disconcerting at times. I'm sure \nyou'll get used to it eventually. \nAnd how are you, Martin? Still trying to save the world and all that? \nMARTIN \nYes. \nSIMON \nPity. Well, armageddon... (considering) it's not for everyone, I suppose. I'm \nquite enjoying it, of course, although Junior over there can be a little bit of a \nhandful. \n[A thunderous earth-quaking boom from “Junior”, who is still some \ndistance away] \nMARTIN \n(Disgusted) I might have guessed you'd be happy living in this nightmare. \nSIMON \nI mean, not that it matters, but, yes I am! Honestly, I think you could be too, if \nyou set your mind to it. But I'm not one to tell you how to live your eternity. \nMARTIN \nNo. You're not. Because I'm done listening to you! \nSIMON \nI'm sorry? I'm not sure I follow. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 174 – The Great Beast \n13 \nMARTIN \nAll those lies you told me — you helped to do this, you turned the world into \nyour, your playground. \nSIMON \nUm, not to be a pedant, but if you recall, I was actually doing a favour for \nPeter. And if Peter had won, none of this would have happened. Also, not to \nmake excuses, but they weren't exactly lies. Just… oversimplifications of \ncomplicated truths. And guesses. \nA lot of guesses. \nAlmost all guesses, really, now I come to think about it. \nMARTIN \nShut up! I don't care. \nSIMON \nGoodness! We're rather tetchy, aren't we? \nARCHIVIST \nWe've... (slight laugh) not been having an easy journey. \nMARTIN \nJohn. \nARCHIVIST \nWhat, it's true; we haven't.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 3, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 4329}}
