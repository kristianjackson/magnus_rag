He’d have a \nbit of a panic, I’d pretend to have forgotten about his phobia, and we’d head \nback down with me feeling slightly avenged. \nI couldn’t have known. \nAt first it was all going exactly according to plan. I was vague about the \nattraction we were going to see, and he clearly hadn’t heard of the Tour \nMontparnasse, so he didn’t make any fuss when we went inside, even when \nwe first got into the elevator. As it started to rise, though, I saw the \napprehension start to creep across his face and he asked where the lift was \ntaking us. I had to fight to suppress a smile as I told him we were heading up to \nthe best view in Paris and his face started to drain of colour. By the \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG075 – A Long Way Down \n9 \n \ntime we reached the top his legs were shaking so badly he was finding it hard \nto stand. I feigned concern, though inside I was savouring his discomfort more \nthan was probably healthy. \nI helped him out of the lift, and he turned around almost immediately, about \nto get back in, but something about the idea of going back down again so soon \nclearly caused him to hesitate. He mumbled something about sitting down and \ncollecting his thoughts, and staggered over to a seat a good distance away \nfrom the barriers that surrounded the building’s rooftop observation terrace. \nI left him to collect his thoughts and walked over to the edge. The view was \nbreathtaking. I could see all of Paris stretching out before me, including the \nEiffel Tower. And in the mid-morning sun it was one of the most beautiful and \nserene things I had ever seen. \nIt was as I gazed at the majestic city below me that I felt a lurch in my stomach, \nlike I was falling, and I pitched forward into the barrier, bruising my arm and \nsending an agonising echo of my broken bone shooting up my body. I braced \nmyself on my hands and knees, trying to overcome the sudden swimming \nnausea in my head. Finally, I managed to centre my vision enough to look up \nand there he was. There was an icy breeze that high up, but he seemed not to \nnotice as his loose, thin shirt billowed around that sprawling white scar. He \nstared at me, and I felt again like I was falling right through the floor. I tried to \nspeak, say anything, but my breath seemed caught in my chest. The worst part, \nthough, was his expression. He looked bored. \nAt some point I felt hands gripping me and I was pulled gently from the floor. It \nwas a pair of tourists from New Zealand who had come over to see if I was \nalright. I mumbled something about vertigo, though the feeling had faded now. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG075 – A Long Way Down \n10 \n \nI looked around, but there was no sign of the scarred man. I looked again, and \nrealised with mounting alarm that there was also no sign of Grant. I checked, \nbut the terrace wasn’t huge and there was nowhere for him to be hiding. I \nthought he must have taken the lift back down, but he wasn’t in the lobby, or \noutside, or anywhere. He was gone. \nI didn’t realise my phone was dead until several hours into the search. When I \nfinally charged it, I had dozens of missed calls from Grant and almost four \nhundred text messages. Most were too scrambled to read, but those that \nweren’t were asking where I was. Where anybody was. Where the elevators \nwere. \nThere was one picture that seemed to have come through without too much \ncorruption: it seemed to show the terrace, but where the barrier should have \nbeen was just a sheer drop, with the top of a ladder reaching up and over it. I \ncouldn’t make out the city below it. I tried to call his phone so many times, but \nwhenever it actually connected, all I heard was the sound of rushing wind. \nI know that man with the scar took my brother. I don’t know how he took him, \nor where, but I know he’s gone. I haven’t seen either of them since, and I don’t \nthink I will. It never felt like I was what he wanted. I really hope Grant is dead. \nBecause, if not, I have a horrible feeling deep inside that he’s still on that \nladder. \nARCHIVIST \nStatement ends. \nMichael Crew. The man with the lightning scar. A fractal pattern burned into \nhis flesh, chased by the manifestation of that pattern and then jumped out a \nwindow.
