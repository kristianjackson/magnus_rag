The cut was nasty, but not deep enough to do any real damage; as you \nsaw, I’m getting quite a scar from it. Still, it meant that even though I was \ntechnically arrested, I got to go in the ambulance rather than the police car. \nThe guys from the scrapyard told them I’d cut myself in the dark on a sharp \npiece of metal. I started screaming at them, trying to tell them what actually \nhappened. That must have been when that dog-walker, or whoever the hell it \nwas, started filming. I was actually a meme for a day or two. \nYou do know what that is, don’t you? \nARCHIVIST \nYes, I know what a meme is. You were saying? \nMELANIE \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG076 – The Smell of Blood \n9 \n \nWell, that’s it, really. After I recovered they dropped the charges, and I came to \nyou, looking to use your library. You see, I still had the serial number, and I \nlooked up the carriage afterwards. It was from World War 2. The 11th US Army \nHospital train, operating in the European theatre from August 1944. The train \ncrew was actually commended for their service. \nARCHIVIST \nBut...? \nMELANIE \nIt crashed in April 1945. Derailed, killed 5 crew and seriously injured 14 more. \nThere weren’t any patients on board at the time. At least, not officially. There \nwas only one steel train car that avoided derailment. \nARCHIVIST \nI see. \nMELANIE \nExactly. There’s not a lot more information on it, though, and I've no idea how \nit ended up in Rotherham. So I came here to dig a bit deeper. \nARCHIVIST \nReally? Our... our library is extensive, but it’s hardly focused on the Second \nWorld War. \nMELANIE \nNo, but the most detailed description of the crash that I could find came from \nthe report of a man called William W. Hay. And later in life William Hay... \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG076 – The Smell of Blood \n10 \n \nARCHIVIST \nBecame a noted occultist, whose memoirs and researches were only ever \npublished in a heavily edited form. And we have unexpurgated copies. \nMELANIE \nExactly. \nARCHIVIST \nDid you find anything? \nMELANIE \nPlenty. He served on the 11th Hospital Train as engineer, and there was a lot \nhe had to say about it. They even let me make a photocopy. \nARCHIVIST \n(Reading) On the subject of savagery, I have myself seen the long-term effects \nupon the psyche of witnessing the violence men may inflict upon one another. \nA dulling of the senses is merely the first step, though one that few progress \nbeyond. In more acute cases, there comes a strange mania, a fascination with \nthe mechanisms of this violence, the tactility of injury and the sensations that \naccompany it. The smell of blood especially appears to incite in a certain sort \nof mind, numbed by the horrors of war, the urge commit unspeakable \nviolence. I saw it once in the eyes of a young medic near Merey, a thing so \ngrotesque that I have some sympathy with those who decided to crash, rather \nthan risk his rampage. But even that pales to insignificance compared to what I \nsaw in the infirmary at Amritsar. Two dozen Ghurkhas tearing each other to \npieces, consumed by the terrible butchery they had inflicted. Such things are \nnot to be dwelt on, but serve to illustrate my proposition that violence, \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG076 – The Smell of Blood \n11 \n \ninflicted, received or even just witnessed, can not only deal injury to the body \nor the mind, but to the soul itself. \nARCHIVIST \nI see. So does this mean...? \nMELANIE \nYes. And I’ve got my plane to India already booked. \nARCHIVIST \nEven after your experience with the hospital train? It sounds like this could be \nfar more dangerous... \nMELANIE \nOh thank you but I don't need your fake concern. I’ve heard them talking \nupstairs. You know this obsession even better than I do. I just wanted to make \nmy statement... \nARCHIVIST \nIn case you get murdered by ghosts. \nMELANIE \nYes. \nARCHIVIST \nI understand. Thank you, Melanie. \nMELANIE \nSure. Where’s Sasha, by the way?
