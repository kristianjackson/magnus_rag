Recorded direct from subject, April 29th, 2017. \nStatement begins. \nSo… what happened? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG094 – Dead Woman Walking \n3 \n \nGEORGIE (STATEMENT) \nIt was my first year of university, before I’d met you. I was still studying English \nat Balliol back then, and trying to hide how poor my family was from everyone \nelse. None of them said anything, of course, but whenever they talked I could \ncount the seconds before I got lost.

But where I was anxious and self-\nconscious, she was angry. I never met anyone who could skewer the pompous \ndickheads like she could.
