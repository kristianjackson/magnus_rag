If fact, I always waited a good long while before leaving my own \nbuilding to make sure I didn’t bump into him. I still didn’t want him to know \nwhere I lived, although now for very different reasons. In the end, though, it \nwas a hobby, not an obsession, and often days would pass when I wouldn’t see \nGraham at all. Maybe there was stuff I missed that would have explained his \nbehaviour. I just wish I’d missed what happened on April 7th. Then maybe I’d \nhave just thought he’d moved on or… I don’t know. I just wish I hadn’t seen it. \nWork had been intense for a couple of months, with so many late nights I’d \nhad to drop out of my course. It was just as well, really, as I hadn’t actually \nspoken to Graham since the night I suffered my head injury. I think he still felt \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG003 – Across The Street \n9 \n \nawkward about it, and I’d seen him do so many weird things alone in his flat \nthat I think I’d have struggled to have a normal conversation with him. \nAnyway, this week I’d barely had time to eat, let alone do much in the way of \nGraham-watching, so when I got home at about half ten at night, my first \nthought was just to fall into bed. But it was Friday, and I’d drunk a huge \namount of coffee to keep going at work, so yeah, I was wired and looking \nforward to a long lie-in the next day. So when I saw Graham’s light was still on, \nI decided to spend a relaxing few minutes checking in on him. His light may \nhave been on, but I couldn’t see him, and I wondered if perhaps he’d gone to \nbed and simply forgotten to turn it off. More likely he was just in the \nbathroom, so I decided to wait a while longer. As I stared at that window, I \nrealised there was something… I don’t know, off about it. It looked different \nsomehow, but I couldn’t figure out what it was. Then I noticed it. At first I’d \njust taken it to be a water pipe running down the side of the building, attached \njust below Graham’s open window. The light from the streetlamps didn’t reach \nup to his fourth floor flat, and the window ledge cast a shadow that stopped \nthe light from the room illuminating it, but it was long, straight, dark, and from \nwhat I could see it just looked like a pipe, except I’d been watching that \nwindow for months now, and would have sworn that there had never been a \npipe there before. And as I stared at it, it moved. It started to bend, slowly, and \nI realised I was looking at an arm, along, thin arm. As it bent the joint close to \nwhere the arm ended, I think I saw another joint further down, also moving, \nand bending what I can only assume were elbows; it hooked the end of the \nlimb over through the window. When I say moved, that’s not quite right. It \nshifted. Like when you stare at one of those old magic eye paintings and you \nchange from seeing one picture into seeing another. I never saw anything I \ncould actually call a hand, but still it pulled itself through his window. It took", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 5, "chunk_count": 9, "chars": 3000}}
