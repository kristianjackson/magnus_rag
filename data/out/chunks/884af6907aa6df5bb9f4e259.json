Statement begins. \nMELANIE \nGhost Hunt UK struggled after Aldershot. Sarah Baldwin disappeared. I spent a \nwhile trying to track her down but nothing led anywhere. I’m sure you found \nthe same. The thing is, even though her peeling and stapling her own skin was \nthe weirdest part of what I saw, it wasn’t what I got really hung up on. Fact is, \nthere was a presence in that place. A genuine, unseen presence that physically \nattacked her. I’ve got no real reference point for who or what Sarah Baldwin \nmight be, but I sure as hell know what a ghost is and how to look into one. \nThe others were dealing with their own stuff. We struggled through another \nyear, but it wasn’t the same. Toni was the worst. She just got harder and \nharder to pin down for shoots, and then I struggled to reach her by phone or \nemail. When she moved down to Bristol in March, she didn’t even tell me. I \nhad to hear it from Pete; in the exact same call he said that he was thinking \nabout leaving the team as well. \nI think that’s kind of why I came to you guys. I knew it was what happened at \nthe CMH that was breaking us apart, but I couldn’t actually talk to them about \nit. Then Andy decided to take what he called “a bit of a holiday” from the \nshow, and I wasn’t sure if he was coming back. If he did, I thought maybe we \ncould find a new team and keep the show going. \nBut he didn’t. \nAs far as Ghost Hunt UK is concerned, he’s still on holiday, and it’s just me. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG076 – The Smell of Blood \n3 \n \nI actually went back to the Cambridge Military Hospital. It was being torn \ndown, but I hopped the fence after dark and just waited. There was nothing. \nJust dust and rubble and silence. If I closed my eyes I could trick myself into \nthinking that the wind was some sort of howl of pain, but that’s all it was, \nreally. The wind. \nSo I started looking into similar buildings, military hospitals specifically, but \nanywhere with a reputation for being haunted and connected to historical \nconflicts. \nIt was then that I started noticing something about the paranormal \ninvestigator community. We all look in the same places. There’s a surprisingly \nsmall number of hauntings and cryptids that we all, sort of, swap between, \nrepeating each other's research and coming to similar conclusions. That’s why \nso many of us tend to go over to America. It’s so much bigger that there’s a lot \nmore supposedly haunted locations on the circuit. Even then, it’s not as many \nas you think. I mean, we get plenty of tips from the public about other stuff – \nthey don’t all come to see you, you know – but if they’re not reporting \nsomething that we’re already at least a bit familiar with, we tend to dismiss \nthem out of hand. I used to assume this was to protect us from drunks and \nweirdos who ate the wrong kind of mushroom. I don’t think that’s it, though. I \nthink it’s to protect us from the stuff that might be real. Make sure we only go \nlooking after encounters that others have already confirmed as safe. I mean, I \ndon’t know what it was about Sarah Baldwin that mixed so badly with the \npresence in the CMH, but that was the first I’d ever heard of a significant \nencounter there. Somewhere, somehow, the community had deemed it as not \ndangerous. Asbestos notwithstanding.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 0, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 4198}}
