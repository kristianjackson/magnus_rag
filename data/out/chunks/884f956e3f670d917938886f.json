There are also a couple of books on him, none of \nwhich I can really recommend, but I guess Ray Cowan’s No Bodies in the Shed \nis the closest to what I’d consider accurate, although it does imply that I was an \naccomplice despite the fact that I was 12 years old at the time. Honestly, I \ndiscovered most of the details from the newspapers and the court, just like \neveryone else. My father spent my formative years killing dozens of people \nand I had no idea. But the more I think back over my childhood, the more sure \nI am that there was something else going on. I don’t have any theories as to \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG009 – A Father’s Love \n3 \n \nwhat any of this means but I just need to get it down on paper somewhere. \nAnd this seems as good a place as any. \nI’ve always lived in the same house on York Road in Dartford. Even now, after \nall that’s happened and all I know about what went on there I can’t bring \nmyself to leave. As far as I know the shed came with the house; it always sat in \nthe garden: old, wooden and silent. I don’t recall it being used until after the \nnight my mother disappeared. That’s when everything started to get strange. \nMy memory of early childhood is patchy, mostly isolated images and \nimpressions, but I remember the night she vanished like it was yesterday. I was \nseven years old and had been to the cinema that evening for the very first time \nin my life. We had been to see The Witches at what was back then the ABC \ndown on Shaftesbury Avenue. I had seen films before, of course, on our tiny \nliving room television but to see a movie on the big screen was awe-inspiring. \nThe film itself was terrifying, though, and even now I’d say it’s far scarier than \nany “child’s film” has a right to be. I remember I spent a lot of it close to tears \nbut had been so proud of the fact that I hadn’t cried at all. When we got home, \nI lay awake for a long time. That scene where Luke is transformed into a mouse \nkept playing in my mind and for some reason it left me too afraid to go to \nsleep. \nIt was then that I heard a thump from downstairs, like something heavy falling \nover. I didn’t have a clock in my room so had no idea what the time was but I \nrecall looking out of the window and the world was dark and utterly silent. The \nthump came again and I decided to go downstairs and see what it was. The \nlanding was almost pitch black, and I tried to be as quiet as possible so nobody \nwould know I was there. The fourth stair down from the top of the staircase \nalways creaked, and still does in fact, but I don’t think I’ve ever heard it creak \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG009 – A Father’s Love \n4 \n \nlouder than it did that night as I crept down them so slowly. The lights \ndownstairs were all turned off, except for the kitchen light, which I could see \nfrom the bottom of the stairway. \nI walked into the kitchen to find it empty. The back door stood open and a cool \nbreeze blew through it that made me shiver in my pyjamas. I saw something \nshiny laying on the table. Reaching up, I found my mother’s pendant. The \ndesign had always struck me as beautiful: it was silver, an abstract shape of a \nhand with a symbol on it that I believe was meant to represent a closed eye. I \nhad never seen her take it off. In my child’s mind I assumed that she had just \nleft it on the table, an accident, and that the open door meant nothing. I went \nback upstairs, necklace clutched firmly in my hand, to return it to her. She \nwasn’t in bed, of course, the space next to where my father lay fast asleep was \nempty. \nI gently touched my sleeping father’s shoulder, and he awoke slowly. I asked \nhim where mum was, and he started to say something when he saw the silver \nchain clutched in my hands. He quickly got out of bed and started to get \ndressed. As he pulled on a shirt he asked me where I had found it and I told \nhim, on the kitchen table. Following me downstairs, his gaze was immediately \nlocked on the open door and he paused. Instead of going outside, he walked \nover to the kitchen sink and turned on one of the taps. Immediately there \nbegan to flow a dark, dirty-looking liquid and the sick, salty smell of brackish \nwater hit my nose, though at the time I didn’t understand that’s what it was. \nThe light in the kitchen blew out at that moment and the room got very dark. \nMy father told me everything was fine, that I should go back to bed.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 1, "chunk_count": 10, "chars": 4500}}
