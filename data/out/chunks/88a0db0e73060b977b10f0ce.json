Yet as soon as their \nnature became apparent, I simply accepted it and began to factor it into my \ndealings with them. It was shortly afterwards I hired my first assistant. A dour \nman, by the name of Albert Stross. He barely lasted a fortnight. \nIt didn’t take me long to track down other books like Lorell’s, and it seemed \nlike almost overnight I had found my purpose. I was to be the keeper of evil \ntomes. To begin with, I never gave much thought to their origins; I simply \nconcerned myself with acquiring them, and making sure I had staff I could \nspare to study them. It was easier than I expected, and I’m always surprised \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG080 – The Librarian \nnobody attempted such a thing before me. I suppose few walk away from their \nfirst encounter with any desire to look for more, if they walk away at all. And of \nthose that do, none would have had my skill at finding them, or my extensive \nresources. \nLuck played a significant role as well. It was shortly after I had begun to have \nproblems storing them that I discovered the work of the architect Robert \nSmirke. There were several volumes in my possession that, if kept them close \nto each other reacted… very badly. But Smirke’s writings, his principles of \nbalance between opposing forces, gave me some inkling as to a solution. Today \nwas not the first time my life has been saved by his architecture. I \ncommissioned a house to be built, based on some of his designs, and spent a \ngood deal of time and money gaining access to existing buildings he had \nworked on, with the aim of storing the books safely. I believe at about that \ntime I commissioned my bookplates and began to label them. \nAnd then the house was complete, and I had my library. A vast, lopsided \nstructure, by turns cavernous or maze-like, depending on the needs of the \ninmates. By the end, I had nine hundred and seventy-eight volumes in my \nlibrary. Some innocuous, some unsettling and some utterly murderous. In the \nend, I didn’t have much time to enjoy my achievement. It was only a few years \nafter the house was complete that the attack came. \nYou must understand, I had only ever encountered these dark powers in the \nform of books or the occasional antique. I had no idea that there were people \nor creatures out there that served them. So I was not prepared. All my \ndefences were inward facing, to prevent the contents of my library getting out. \nI suppose getting in must have seemed a trifle. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG080 – The Librarian \nIt started with the visitors. Almost every day, some stranger would turn up at \nmy door and ask to see my collection. Now, whatever my secret ambitions \nmight have been, I was very careful not to let word get out about what I was \ndoing. And these people, they were… wrong somehow. They didn’t move as \npeople should move, and their cadence was very strange when they spoke. \nThey almost always forgot to blink. \nEven then I didn’t realise what was coming, and simply sent them away with a \nfirm refusal. When it actually happened, it was so all fast I barely had time to \nregister it. One moment, I was typing a new catalogue entry for A Journal of a \nPlague Year, and the next… everything was screaming. My assistants, the \nbooks, even me. \nThomas McMann was stabbed through the throat by something with too many \nteeth and limbs like knives. Mary Johnson was pulled into a cavernous maw \nthat opened beneath her. Gregory Todd ran into a door that shouldn’t have \nbeen there. A great hand reached down through the roof and plucked away \nLeandra Toulouse. And there was one other assistant, whose… whose name I \ndon’t recall, but the last I saw of him, he was being pulled into a great, \npulsating pile of meat. \nI don’t know how I escaped. Perhaps because I designed the house, I knew \nhow to best move through it. Perhaps I was sensible enough to steer clear of \nthe rooms that had fallen into darkness, or burned with a fire that seemed to \nleave the books untouched. Perhaps they let me go. Or perhaps, once again, it \nwas simply luck. \nI didn’t look back as I fled. Nothing seemed to chase me, at least not then. I \nhad none of the books with me, and that was what they were after.
