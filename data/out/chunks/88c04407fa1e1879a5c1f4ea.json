No, of course you don’t, bet half \nthe guys roll in here are leaking scotch all over your precious paperwork. I’m \nsober enough to write it down, for now at least, and that’s all that matters to \nyou, isn’t it? \nI’m a private investigator. Used to be police, but not anymore. None of your \nbusiness why. You can draw your own conclusions, if you want, but it’s not \nsomething I care to talk about. Anyway, last June I got a job from one Nicola \nLerado.

A loser. I know I’m not one to talk, but I couldn’t help \nsympathising with the wife. And not just because she was the one paying me. \nHector worked IT for some shipping and delivery company with its admin \ncentre down in Liverpool Street. I say he worked there, but that could easily be \na lie. Even though I wasn’t able to get past the front desk, the sheer number of", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 0, "chunk_count": 10, "chars": 2909}}
