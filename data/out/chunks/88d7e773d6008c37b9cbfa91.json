We stood there in silence for a few seconds until he \nsaid something about needing something new to read, turned around and \nwalked off. \nI was, I will admit, a bit unsettled. As far as I could recall I had never seen Jared \nread… well, anything, really. And the look in his eyes when he had left had \nsomething in it not entirely unlike fear. Still, it was a welcome relief to have \nhim gone, and I quickly tidied up the rest of the books before Ruth noticed \nanything amiss. \nThere was nothing else I recall that happened that day at the library, but on \nthe way home afterwards I passed by Jared’s house. I had moved back in with \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG017 – The Boneturner’s Tale \n7 \n \nmy parents while I got everything sorted out after university, and he had never \nmoved out of his childhood home, so we still lived on the same street. It was \nlate September at this point, so by the time I had walked back from the library \nit was dark, and I noticed a small shape moving in the pool of orange light \nbelow the streetlamp. \nAs I got closer, I realised with a slight start that it was a rat, and not a dirty, \nwild rat but a large, white one, quite well-kept and clearly once a pet. But \nthere was something very wrong with it. It was dragging itself slowly, pulling \nfrom the front legs, and I saw that the back half of it was flat, as though \ndeflated somehow. I thought it must have been run over, but there was no \nblood or sign of crushing, nor did it seem to be in any actual pain. It just had a \nback half that flopped and twitched obscenely as it made its gradual way \nacross the lighted pavement and out into the darkness. I just stood there and \nwatched, transfixed by it, until it disappeared from view. Thinking about it \nnow, I remember its head was turned at a strange angle, far further round than \nit should have been, although I might be getting confused. Many of these \nexperiences run together when I look back on them. There was no light on in \nJared’s house, but I hurried home quickly after that. \nI didn’t see Jared again for some time. At first I was just happy for the space, \nbut as the days turned into weeks I started to feel something I wouldn’t have \nexpected to – worry. If it hadn’t been for the way he had left last time it \nprobably wouldn’t have bothered me, but he had looked so strange, and even \nwithout him coming to the library it was rare I would go a week without seeing \nhim. By now it had almost been a month. Still, I resisted the urge to go to his \nhouse and check. If it turned out he was fine, then I’d be inviting a whole world \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG017 – The Boneturner’s Tale \n8 \n \nof unpleasantness, and besides that, I reminded myself, he wasn’t my problem \nanymore. \nIt was late October when Jared’s mother came in. It was near the end of the \nday, and outside was already dark. I was putting up a display about good \nHallowe’en reads before heading home, when I heard the door open. I turned \naround and there she was. It took me a few seconds to recognise her, if I’m \nhonest. I hadn’t seen much of her in the years since Jared and I had been close, \nand she had aged noticeably. Mrs. Hopworth wore a bulky overcoat, though it \nwasn’t that cold yet, and her arm hung down in a sling. Something about the \nangle of the arm and how it hung there seemed faintly abnormal, and I \nwondered if she had broken it. \nWhen I asked Mrs. Hopworth if she was okay she just stared at me, her eyes \nburning with hatred. With her good arm she reached into her coat and pulled \nout a small, black paperback. She threw it on the floor without saying a word \nand turned to leave. I couldn’t help myself, I asked her if Jared was alright. She \nspun back and started to swear violently at me, told me I had no business with \nher son and that I, and my books, were to stay away from him. As she spoke, I \ncouldn’t look away from her arm and the odd ways it twisted as she gestured. \nHow her fingers seemed to bend the wrong way. I was glad that Ruth had gone \nhome early as I didn’t want her to witness the disturbing confrontation I had \nnow apparently caused. \nWhen she had finished, Mrs. Hopworth spat towards me, though I noticed she \nwas careful to avoid spitting at the book that now lay on the floor between us, \nand left. I put down the copy of Stephen King’s Misery that I now realised I’d \nbeen clutching, and approached the discarded volume that lay on the carpet. \nThe bat", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 3, "chunk_count": 9, "chars": 4500}}
