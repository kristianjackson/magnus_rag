I think that’s what originally drew me to her. I \nthought she was just like me, another weirdo cast off from the world. I mean, \nthere was no way I could have known she wasn’t human. At least, I don’t see \nhow she can have been human, not the way we think of it. But she was so \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG067 – Burning Desire \n \n2 \n \nbeautiful. S-she was tall with long, straight auburn hair and these eyes that … \nwhen they looked at you, it didn’t feel like she was seeing you, so much as … as \ntrapping you. I never understood the phrase ‘like a deer in the headlights’ until \nshe looked me in the eyes for the first time. I don’t know, maybe something in \nmy fight or flight reflexes screwed up, because those weren’t the instincts I felt \nwhen it happened. I should have run, of course. I don’t know if you normally \nleave people alone in a room when they write their statements, but I can \nunderstand you doing so in my case. I’m getting used to people making polite \nexcuses not to look at me. \n \nDalia tried to warn me off. Dalia Okonjo had worked in The Canyon Cafe ever \nsince it opened in 1991 and, as soon as I headed back into the kitchen after I \nsaw Agnes Montague for the first time, she spotted the look in my eyes and \nshook her head. She told me she was trouble, that there was something not \nright about her. I asked for more details and Dalia just shrugged, said that \nshe’d been coming into the cafe ever since it opened and that there was \nsomething off. At the time I assumed that she meant Agnes had been coming \nin ever since she was a child as she looked about my age, but looking back I’m \nnot so sure. \n \nIt wasn’t as though it would have made any difference, I was drawn to her in a \nway I can’t even explain. I could never bring myself to say anything or even \nmake a sound when her eyes fell on me. I barely had enough wherewithal to \nconfirm her order, even if it was always the same: a large cup of black coffee, \nwith enough room for milk. She never actually put any milk in it. She never \neven drank it. She’d just take it over and sit there, staring out the window into \nthe street for an hour or so. It wasn’t like there was much a view, just a normal", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 0, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 2980}}
