You’re joking. \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nI can assure you this will record just fine. \n \nMELANIE \nI knew you guys were a bit… slapdash, but this is absurd. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG028 – Skin Tight \n2 \n \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nNo doubt you’re used to a higher calibre of equipment when pretending to see \nghosts in old churchyards and mental institutions \n \nMELANIE \nPeople like a show. People like our show. And, even if we do ham it up a bit, \neven we do add a bit of sparkle, we’re still more respected and evidence-based \nparanormal investigators than you and your lot. \n(Mocking laugh) \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nWe are not ‘paranormal investigators’. We are researchers. Scholars. \n \nMELANIE \nWhatever. The fact is, we may play it up a bit for the camera, but that’s \nbecause you can only look at temperature spikes and EMF readings for so long. \nWe still only look into genuine, documented supernatural phenomena. You \ntake any ridiculous story, from any drugged-up, dreaming, traumatised idiot off \nthe street. Vampires, monsters under the bed, mind control – really! Who \ncares about evidence, who cares about scientific instruments when you can \njust tell a story to the Magnus Institute! \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nAnd yet you’ve come to make a statement. \n \nMELANIE \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG028 – Skin Tight \n3 \n \nWell, yeah... But… \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nLet me guess. None of your ‘respectable’, paranormal investigators would \nbelieve you? \n \nMELANIE \n(SIGHS) \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nWell, let me be quite clear. Chances are very strong that I won’t believe you \neither. But we will take your statement. And we will look into it for you. Now, \nplease state your name and the subject of your experience. \n \nMELANIE \nMy name is Melanie King. I’ve got a YouTube channel called Ghost Hunt UK. \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nAnd your statement is regarding... \n \nMELANIE \nWhat I saw at the abandoned Cambridge Military Hospital when we were \nfilming there in January 2015. \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nRecording date 17th April 2016. Hold on, the Cambridge Military Hospital? I \nwas under the impression the hauntings there were very well-documented. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG028 – Skin Tight \n4 \n \nWhy would none of your ‘respectable’ colleagues believe you? I would have \nthought it would be right up their alley. \n \nMELANIE \nBecause what I saw had nothing to do with the hospital itself. At least, I don’t \nthink it did. \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nGo on. \n \nMELANIE \nWell, we’d been angling to film there for months. The show is pretty standard \nstuff – we head to the location after dark, we explore a bit, we set up the \nequipment, and then, of course, we spend some time afterwards analysing the \ndata and… \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nSeeing ghosts? \n \nMELANIE \nWell, yeah. Y’know what? Sometimes, sure. We do. We get evidence. Anyway, \nwe’d been angling to go into the CMH for months, er, but I couldn’t get \npermission. Apparently there’s asbestos in the walls; it makes it “too much of a \nhealth and safety hazard”. It was due to be pulled down and turned into a \nhousing development in June, though, so we were on a bit of deadline. Luckily, \nwe’re an independent show.
