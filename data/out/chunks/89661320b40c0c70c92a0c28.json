I \nlooked at her, the door still open, and she winked at me. Without warning, a \nterrible, blistering heat erupted on my back, and I screamed again, this time in \nagony. Reflex slammed my foot down, and I felt the car start as she removed \nher hand, laughing that same horrible laugh. \nI did manage to get away, though there’s a good chance I’ll never use this arm \nproperly again. I went to the police, of course. I didn’t tell them exactly what \nhappened, just that I’d noticed what I believed to be human remains during a \njob, and had been attacked as I tried to leave. They actually took me seriously, \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG087 – The Uncanny Valley \n10 \n \nand were all prepared to drive out to investigate, as I understand it, when the \nfire started. The worst fire in Gwydir Forest for almost two hundred years, \napparently. Some of the most beautiful natural scenery in the world reduced \nto ash. It destroyed my home, as well as quite a few of the others in \nPenmachno, but luckily nobody died. \nThe weirdest part, though? Nobody died, officially speaking, because although \nthe police, fire crews and forest services combed the burned area acre by \nscorched acre, they didn’t find any human remains at all. The closest they \nfound was the warped and twisted frame of an old, plastic mannequin. \nGERTRUDE \nFinal comments: When this statement was added to the Collection, I was \nconvinced it was the Stranger issuing me a direct threat. Mr. Sebastian Skinner. \nIt seemed too targeted a name to be real. But all my research points to him \nbeing a real person: a plumber trading out of Penmachno for almost twenty \nyears. Hopefully not too ominous a coincidence. \nThe concerning part of this statement, at least as far as I’m concerned, is not so \nmuch what is happening, as the fact that it is happening so soon. I had \nassumed Orsinov and her ilk would have spent more time searching for their \nprecious skin, maybe even acting against me directly, before they started \nalternate preparations. I had hoped I’d have a chance to recover. I can still \nbarely stand. \nI’d hoped there would be more time. \nAs with anything like this, exact calculations are impossible, but based on Mr. \nSkinner’s testimony, I think there’s every likelihood that they will be ready to \nperform the Unknowing within the next few years. There may be no chance for \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG087 – The Uncanny Valley \n11 \n \na more… ‘nuanced’ way to disrupt it, so I’ll likely have to resort to a somewhat \nmore… direct countermeasure. Hmm. \nIt interests me that Jude Perry would be involved. I was unaware that The \nLightless Flame had had any contact with the Stranger’s ilk, but I suppose it \nmakes sense that it would be a possible ally to the Devastation, especially since \ntheir own plans have so recently, erm, gone up in flames. Perhaps they hope to \nachieve a pride of place in the world Orsinov hopes to bring about? Or maybe, \nthey simply relished the chance to burn down some beautiful forest. \nRegardless, I’ve been keeping an eye Jude’s movements ever since she lost \nAgnes, and it appears she’s back in Havering. Part of me wants to confront her, \nsee what she knows, but I’m not that desperate. Not yet. (Sigh) \nI’ve been unable to contact Mr. Skinner since he gave his statement. Sad, but \nunsurprising. There’s no doubt in my mind that when the Unknowing begins, \none of the dancers will be wearing his face. \n[Tape clicks off. Tape clicks on.] \nARCHIVIST \nHmm. What strikes me more than anything else here is the date. It’s only a \nyear or so before she died. I had assumed Gertrude had recorded to tape for a \nwhile and then stopped, but it seems she was recording them right up until the \nend. But if they did span decades of working at the Institute, why aren’t there \nmore? And what decided which statements she transferred? \nRegardless, whoever my mystery pen pal is, it seems they’re pushing me in a \nvery deliberate direction. It sounds like the Unknowing is a ritual, one \nconnected to the Stranger, this ‘I Do Not Know You’. What did Gertrude mean", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 4, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 4154}}
