I got another whiff of \nthat dank, rotten smell as I approached. The carpet immediately in front of the \ndoor was stained ever-so-slightly, a darker colour than it should have been, as \nthough something had leaked out from underneath it. The wood was old and \nworn compared to the others in the building, which looked to have been \nreplaced relatively recently. There was no number on it, or any indication that \nit was, in fact, Toby Carlisle who lived there. I knocked, trying to give the action \na confidence that I frankly did not feel. \nThere was no answer, so I knocked again, louder this time, and I heard some \nmovement from inside, gradually heading towards the door. The steps were \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG018 – The Man Upstairs \n6 \n \nmuffled, like he was walking over thick carpet, until they stopped on the other \nside. There was no sound at all. \nI waited for a minute, and was just about to knock again when the door \nopened, just a crack. There didn't seem to be any lights on inside; it wasn't \nopen wide enough for me to get a good look or even see the man himself, but \nit was enough that I heard when a cracked, ragged voice spoke. It said, “What \ndo you want?” \nThrough that crack I was hit by a sudden wave of that rancid air and reeled \nbackwards, fighting back the urge to vomit. Through it, I just about managed to \nstammer out the question as to whether he was Toby Carlisle, that I'd had a \ndelivery for him. There was silence for a second, then a hand shot out and \ngrabbed the package I held, pulling it out of my grasp before I had a chance to \nfully realise what was happening. The hand was thin and pale, with long, filthy \nyellow fingernails. On the back I saw a single dark red mark, that might have \nbeen a cut or a lesion, but it was gone before I had a chance to see it in more \ndetail. The door slammed in my face, and I was left standing in the hall, \nnauseous and confused. As I turned to go, I noticed that there was a spot of \nviscous liquid on my jacket sleeve, where the hand had brushed me, thick and \noff-white. I had to throw the jacket out, in the end. I couldn't rid of the smell. \nAnd so that was it for a long time. The man upstairs was named Toby and he \nwas a disgusting shut-in who smelled rancid and occasionally made hammering \nnoises. It was a long way from ideal, but it was something I could understand \nand live with. Two years passed like this, and I had almost forgotten about him, \nto be honest. He had become just another part of my life and could be lived \naround. It wasn't until late 2007 I had cause to really think about him again. My \nmother's health had taken a turn for the worst over the previous few months \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG018 – The Man Upstairs \n7 \n \nand I had made the decision to move back up to Sheffield to be nearer to her. \nAs I mentioned, I'm self-employed so the move wasn't as much of a difficulty \nas it might have been, but it did leave me with the need to sell my flat. I don't \nwant to get bogged down with the details of my mother's ailments; in the end \nshe actually passed away a few months later from complications following an \noperation. I still ended up moving, though for a very different reason. \nIt was difficult to sell the place. Every time someone came round for a viewing \nit ended the same way, and I started to dread when the inevitable question \nwould come: what's that smell? It was the third time that the potential buyers, \na nice professional couple who worked in the City, pointed out the stain on the \nliving room ceiling. It was subtle at first, a slight discolouration that I had \nmanaged to overlook. They assumed it was a leak, and I did too, promising to \nhave a plumber come over and check it out, though I didn't hear back from \nthem anyway. \nI did call for a plumber, but for whatever reason was told that it would be \nanother week before they could see me. I tried to have a couple more viewings \nin that time, but the stain on the ceiling was becoming more obvious, and the \nsmell had begun to pervade my whole flat, to the point where I was thinking \nabout staying in a hotel until the plumber arrived. I was starting to doubt it was \na leaking water pipe. As it grew, it started to turn a dark yellow in colour and \nglistened ever so slightly when the light hit it. I knew it was something to do \nwith the flat upstairs, though when I went up to ask this time, my knocking \nwent unanswered. \nFinally the plumber arrived.
