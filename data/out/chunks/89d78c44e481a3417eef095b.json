I found it a \ndifficult, heavy material to work with, never quite as wet as I needed it to be \nno matter how much water I added, but looking over at Gabriel, it was like it \nwas alive in his hands, eagerly bending itself into whatever shape he wanted. \nAnd those shapes were... odd. I remember one of our earlier projects was just \nto do a fish, just a rough shape of a fish, nice and simple. Ray had even \npremade some armatures for us. I mean, I still struggled, and Mary and Bill had \na good old go at it, but over in the corner, Gabriel just began grabbing and \nmoulding and twisting into a shape that was… well, it certainly wasn’t a fish. It \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 126 – Sculptor’s Tool \n4 \n \nsort of almost started out like a fish, but it just kept going and going, looping \nback and into itself, as though it was swimming through its own body. \nAfter a half hour, I’d almost completely forgotten my own work, instead just \nstaring at this serpentine structure that the dreadful man was building. The \nmost infuriating part was that whenever Ray would pass his table, he’d just \nnod gently to himself and trade a few words with Gabriel, as though whatever \nit was that he was trying to make was in any way similar to the practice we’d \nbeen assigned. I know, it was an amateur class and he was under no obligation \nto do exactly the work as instructed, but Ray was very clear with the rest of us \nthat we were doing things in a specific order for a reason, and it was just a bit \nfrustrating to see him nodding along to that awful man flagrantly disregarding \nwhat we were meant to be doing. \nAt one point, Gabriel must have noticed me staring. He looked back at me for \nthe longest time, far longer than I was comfortable with, and then he picked \nup his nasty, spiralling clay fish, and walked over towards me. I could feel my \nhairs standing on end as he got closer and he held it towards my face. He asked \nme if I could help him, because he was having a bit of a creative block, and I \nremember thinking he had palest eyes I’d ever seen. Then my gaze focused \nback onto the thing in his hands, that dead, curling lump of clay, and I watched \nit move. \nIt coiled around, through its own face, and flailed its long, distorted fins in \ndesperate, pained movements. It made a noise that sounded like a scream \nheard through water, and stretched out towards my mouth, which I’ll admit \nwas hanging open in horror. If I hadn’t screamed and fallen backwards, I am \nsure the thing would have dived down my throat. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 126 – Sculptor’s Tool \n5 \n \nThe others rushed over to me, making all the appropriate noises of surprise \nand concern, but I could only watch as Gabriel rushed back to his bench and \nstarted to furiously work on his sculpture again. He looked over at me and I \nheard him speak quite clearly, though no-one else reacted to it. \n“What an excellent idea,” he said. “A very promising direction indeed.” \nI quit the class after that. I emailed Ray to explain that I would no longer be \nattending and left it at that. Obviously, I didn’t tell him exactly what I’d seen, \nbut I thought some general references to inappropriate behaviour from one of \nthe other students would get my point across. And then I continued with my \nlife and I didn’t give Gabriel another thought. At least, not until I went to my \nsalsa class the following Thursday, and instead found myself walking into a \nroom set up for sculpture. \nI was obviously taken aback at what had to be a really significant scheduling \nissue, but having a quick check of the timetable of classes it looked very much \nlike sculpting had always been on a Thursday, which didn’t make much sense \nto me, stood there in my dancing shoes and feeling like a fool. Gabriel gave me \na sheepish smile and returned to whatever it was he was working on. Ray \nseemed absolutely delighted to see me and made such a big show of it that I \ndidn’t really feel like I could just turn around and leave. I asked him if he’d got \nmy email, and he nodded emphatically as he ushered me over to my table, but \ndidn’t elaborate. Bill gave me a slightly pained smile, but when I asked if he \nwas alright, he just shrugged and told me he couldn’t complain. There was no \nsign of Mary. They still haven’t found her. \nSo, I started to work. Ray told us the lesson was faces.
