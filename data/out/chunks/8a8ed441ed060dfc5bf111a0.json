I mean, none of it makes sense. It was all impossible, and the terrible \nthings that happened while we were hanging there absolutely could not have \nhappened. But given that they did, I don’t understand why they happened to \nus. There was nothing special about us, nothing remarkable about our trip. \nWere we just random bystanders to something awful? We must have been, \nbecause I don’t see why anyone would choose for something to happen to us. \nIt must have been the old man, of course, but again, why? \nMy father passed away almost twelve years ago now. Pancreatic cancer. I’m \nsure I don’t need to explain that it was devastating, probably the first true grief \nI’ve ever felt, but in the years that followed, I found that it brought me much \ncloser to my mum. Her and Dad were always something of a unit, you see, and \ngrowing up I feel like I had less of a specific relationship with them as people \nand more a relationship with ‘my parents’. Not unusual, but once I moved out \nand started to get on with my own life, we ended up becoming a bit distant, \nand on the few times a year I would see them, it was again going to visit my \nparents, without any real thought for the individual relationships. \nThis all ended with my father’s death. Grief brought Mum and me closer than \nwe had ever been before. I would call her regularly and I’d make the trip up to \nSwansea at least once a month, until I finally moved back there four years ago. \nIt was the second year after Dad passed that we started our annual holiday \ntogether. At first, it was just a way to try and get Mum a bit more interested in \nthe world again, but soon enough it was a highlight of our year. We’d go for a \nweek, normally, maybe two if I’d kept back enough annual leave. Mum wasn’t \ngreat with long flights, so we tended to keep ourselves to Central or Western \nEurope, though I got her as far as Corfu one year. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 124 – Left Hanging \n3 \n \nHer big passion was mountains. We always had to go up a mountain. Well, to \nbe fair, it wasn’t mountains she loved specifically, it was views. There was little \nthat delighted Mum quite as much as to see the whole of creation spread out \nbefore you like a grand carpet, and we would always burn through a good \nnumber of Euros using whatever coin-operated telescopes they’d set up at the \nlookout spot. She also found an affinity for the thinner air of higher altitudes. I \nnever really understood how that worked, as I thought it was meant to make it \nharder to breathe, and after a few hours, I always tended to end up with a bit \nof a headache, but Mum took to it like nobody’s business, and after a minute \nor two, was always more spry than I’d see her the whole rest of the year. \nOf course, at her age, actually climbing a mountain would have been a bit \nmuch, so our holidays very much tended to be the highest peaks in Central and \nWestern Europe that could be scaled by coach, train or cable car. Well-\nsupplied as many European mountains are with public transport options, this \ndid limit us a bit. So that’s why, this year, we found ourselves returning to \nSalzburg, one of our first ever destinations, and to Untersberg, one of our \nfavourite mountains, towered distantly over the city. It was a marvellous view, \nas I recalled, although the quickest and most reliable way to reach it was \nunfortunately by cable car. \nYou see, I don’t do amazingly with heights. I wouldn’t describe it as full vertigo \n– and certainly, when we’re actually at the top of the mountain, I don’t have \nany problem at all if I steer clear of the edges – but traditionally, getting from \nsea level up to the top is something of a trial to me, to say nothing of coming \nback down. I’ve never really shared these fears with", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 0, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 4499}}
