All the others \nseemed to accept this without question, and I didn’t feel I could press the matter \nwithout drawing negative attention, something I was desperate to avoid doing. So \nI just sat there as it grew bitter, cloudy, and rancid. Nobody bothered to get rid of \nthe wine and the smell gradually began to permeate through the building. \nThose closest to Claude began to change as well. Everyone in the community had \nalways been very touchy-feely, but now it seemed like they were always touching \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 153 – Love Bombing \n8 \n \neach other, or holding hands or in some way, pressing their skin to each other \neven at mealtimes or in situations where it seemed really awkward. A few times \nthey touched me, hugged me or shook my hand, and each time I could feel myself \nstruggling not to recoil. They’d stare at me with their yellowing eyes and their skin \nwas dry and somehow sticky when I pressed it. It yielded ever so slightly like there \nwasn’t anything solid inside. Even then, I didn’t think to leave. I couldn’t figure out \nwhat was going on but I trusted Claude so completely I couldn’t imagine it was \ntruly harmful. \nThen came the day when he announced that the Eleventh had arrived. I expected \ncheers, excitement, but instead there were just murmurings of resolve and \ndetermination as though a difficult task lay ahead. Claude asked who was going to \nbe the first to meet them. Everyone went quiet, awed by the sudden opportunity \nfor divine benediction. He walked up and gently touched Joyce on the cheek, and \nshe smiled with a happiness more pure than I’d ever seen on a human face. \nWe formed into a long line, a chain holding hands with Joyce at the very end of it. \nIt stretched from one end of the building to the other. I was at the other end so \ndidn’t see what happened when she walked to Claude’s private chambers, but as \nshe did, something passed down the line. I don’t know how to describe it really. \nDid you ever do that experiment in science class, where you held hands in a line \nand the teacher passed a very gentle electric shock down through the students, \nfeeling of a charge going through you? It was like that but what passed through us \nwas warm and slick, and seemed to flow through my body like oil and out into the \nground. Everyone felt it. Their blissful smiles made me feel even more nauseated \nthan the sensation itself. I never saw Joyce again. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 153 – Love Bombing \n9 \n \nEach day after evening meal, Claude chose someone else to meet the Eleventh. \nEach time, the same process, the same daisy-chaining of hands, at the end the \nsame sick feeling sliding through me. Another member of the community gone, \nthe line getting shorter. A fear fell over the others and at first I thought it was the \nsame fear that I had, but when I heard them talk of it, what they feared was that \nthey wouldn’t get chosen. That somehow this chance for pure, divine love would \npass them by. And I suddenly came to the realization that perhaps I didn’t belong \nhere like I thought I did. \nSo one night I decided to see for myself. I waited until after lights-out and slipped \nfrom the dormitory through the empty corridors towards Claude’s private rooms. \nThe moon was bright through the window, casting everything in stark pale \nshadow. As I got close, I began to smell it. It wasn’t rancid, not like the wine, but \nsweet like overripe fruit or sugar that’s cooked too long. I found myself standing \nin front of the understated wooden door that I’d now seen almost a dozen people \ndisappear into. My hand reached slowly for the handle, when I heard someone \nmoving behind it. \nNo, it wasn’t someone moving. It was many people, I’m sure of it. The sounds of \ndozens of limbs moving and stepping and shuffling in unison. Then laughter. Then \nweeping. Then movement again. I looked down at my shaking hand, and saw that \nseeping under the door was something slick and colorless, a greasy residue that \nsmelled overpoweringly of that sickly sweet odor. \nI took a step back, suddenly nauseated and almost fell into the arms of Claude, \nwho had silently come up behind me.
