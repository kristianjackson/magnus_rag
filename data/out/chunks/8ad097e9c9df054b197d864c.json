Far from the \ncomforting friend of children he is so often portrayed as, he was rendered as \nquite the monster. \nI remember how the old maid of the story describes him quite keenly, as well \nas I remember my own dread at the passage Denman translated: \n“He comes to children who don't go to bed, and throws his sand all into their \neyes, and they start to bleed. He takes those fallen eyes up in his bag, and \ncarries them up into the crescent moon, to his nest, where his own children \nfeast upon them. They have crooked beaks like owls, all the better to pick the \neyes of naughty human children.” \n\nDear lord, just remembering it, even now, blind as I am, it still makes me shake. \nYou can imagine the effect it had on me as a lad. Denman read us through the \nrest of the stories, but I could barely pay attention, my mind fixated on that \nfigure with its razor-sharp sand and long, hooked beak. Now, when I heard my \nmasters walk past my room at night, I had no doubt as to the terrible shape \nthey had taken. I had the most awful nightmares of the Sandman, stood in my \ndoorway, motionless, intoning in the voice of my father: “Lights out”. \nI had never told anyone of this childhood terror, not even my wife. So, you may \nimagine the shock and confusion when I heard the words spoken by Maxwell \nRayner. He actually looked almost surprised at my expression when I pulled \nback from him, clearly sensing he had struck a nerve. Perhaps he didn’t know, \nand I was simply a victim of the most grotesque coincidence. \nWhatever the situation, I mumbled my excuses and fled. I swear I could still \nfeel those unseeing eyes follow me as I left the room, a grin of victory playing \nupon his lips. \nPerhaps you can guess what happened next. I don’t know how vivid or \nnightmarish the other accounts you collect here might be. Certainly nobody \nelse believes me when I speak of it. But… the Sandman came for me that very \nnight. \nHe was nothing like the story. He was tall, yes, and thin, but the edges of him \nwere impossible to see against the darkness he was a part of. He had no beak, \nbut coarse black sand trickled from his open mouth and hit the floor with a \nsteady hiss. His legs were long, but he crossed the room slowly, every one of \nhis joints moving and twisting as he took step after torturous step. There was \nno sound at all. I looked to my wife, but she was locked in a peaceful sleep. \nA thin beam of moonlight was clearly marked upon the floor, where a gap in \nthe curtains let it shine through. As the long dark foot touched it, I watched \nthat moonlight curdle like rancid milk. Wherever the Sandman touched, the \nworld dissolved into a choking darkness. First my door. Then creeping along \nthe distance of our bedroom. Then the bed itself. Then my Agatha. \nUntil all that was left was me, the darkness, and the dreadful thing that \nbrought it.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 4, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 2961}}
