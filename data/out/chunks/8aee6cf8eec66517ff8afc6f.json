Admittedly I was, so I don’t hold a grudge, but I didn’t much care for \nthe experience. Anyway, for now, just relax, and no doubt I’ll get there \neventually — I haven’t had anyone to talk to properly in months. \nMARTIN \nI thought… what about Annabelle? \nMIKAELE \nShe keeps mostly to herself, and when she does talk, it’s usually more of the \nsinister monologue variety or cryptically telling me I’ve got ‘guests’. \nMARTIN \n(Crosstalk with ‘variety’) Ah. \nEr, yeah, that sounds familiar. \nARCHIVIST \nI’m trying to be less cryptic. \nMARTIN \nI-I know, I know. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 181 – Ignorance \n11 \nMIKAELE \nSo what’s it like out there? I assume the Archivist must be a rather powerful \nposition, since you seem to be travelling through it pretty freely. \nARCHIVIST \nIt’s a… uh… um… \nMARTIN \nJohn? \nARCHIVIST \nSorry I just, ah… Hmm. \nMARTIN \nI-It’s bad. Really bad. It’s all carved up between the powers, and everyone has \njust been sort of, scooped up, and chucked into their deepest fears. It’s just- \nit’s just nightmare after nightmare after nightmare, and, er… \nWhy are you smiling? \nMIKAELE \nI’m sorry, you’re quite right – it’s inappropriate. It’s simply... I have spent the \nlast decade preparing for this to happen. Not just something like this, but \nalmost exactly this situation. There was every chance, in fact the great \nlikelihood, that I was wasting my time, and throwing away years of my life on a \nridiculous precaution. But I was right. I. Was. Right. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 181 – Ignorance \n12 \nAnd now here I am, safe, warm and comfortable while out there the whole \nworld screams. I don’t mean to be sound… a-as if I’m happy that people are \nsuffering— \nMARTIN \nGood, ‘cause it does sound a bit like that. \nMIKAELE \nThen I apologise. I’m just not sure I can fully communicate the sense of… of \nvindication that I feel — all those long nights I spent wondering if I was \nparanoid or overreacting... But no. I am here. And I am safe. \nMARTIN \n(Sighs) I mean… I guess that makes sense? \nMIKAELE \nSo what of you two? What… Wh-Where are you going? You seem to be \ntravelling with some purpose. \nARCHIVIST \nDid Annabelle not tell you that? \nMIKAELE \nShe said you were travelling to the Tower. The Panopticon, she called it, \nwhatever that might be. She didn’t say what for. \n(Suspiciously) Nothing that might cause me trouble, I hope? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 181 – Ignorance \n13 \nMARTIN \nWe’re going to try and end this. Turn the world back. \nARCHIVIST \nMartin! \nMARTIN \nWhat? Okay. Maybe he can help. We could use some support. And it’s, it’s not \nlike he wants the world to stay like this either. \nMIKAELE \nYou are right, to a point. I would welcome a return to the real world. Ha! To be \nthe only man to weather the greatest disaster in history of reality utterly \nunharmed. What an achievement that would be, quite the boast. But alas no, I \ncan’t help you. \nMARTIN \nWhat? Why not? \nMIKAELE \nI have nothing to offer. Well, except perhaps some… basic provisions — I have \nfood, drink, a few luxuries. But none of that would help you out there and I’m \ncertainly not going to follow you. No, I think the best thing I can do is to \nwelcome you to stay in my sanctuary as long as you wish. \nMARTIN \nOh, well, thank you. I think we just might. John? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 181 – Ignorance \n14 \nARCHIVIST \nI can’t use my powers here. I-I can’t protect us. \nMARTIN \nProtect us from what? \nARCHIVIST \nI-It’s going to be difficult to relax with a spider lurking around. \nMIKAELE \nIt gets easier with practice. \n(Beat) \nARCHIVIST \nAlright, I-I guess we can stay. Just for a bit. \nMIKAELE \nExcellent! I haven’t had guests since the world ended! \nARCHIVIST \n(Flat) Lovely. \nMIKAELE \nOh saying that, I suppose there was that insect thing that stumbled in here a \nmonth or so back… \nMARTIN \nEr, ah, insect thing?", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 2, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 3981}}
