The deserter slumped. He \nwas dead the moment the first shot sounded. Maybe even before that. For all \nhis gaunt frame and emaciated body, he hit the ground with a weight that \nseemed to shake the mountain. I’d never before witnessed a firing squad, and I \nnever care to again, although of course, I was alone in the tunnel. \nI left the deserter’s corpse there. Left the cave and the mountain. Left my \nhome and my country. \nEventually I came here, and I never want to return. That is my story. \nMARTIN \nS-S-Statement... done. \n(Martin takes deep, shakey breaths) \n\nI don’t like recording these. There. I-I said it. I’m sorry whoever’s listening to \nthis, I know it’s unprofessional, but they f... I don’t like it. I guess we’re past \nprofessionalism now. Probably. I don’t even know why I’m still doing them, \nsince John’s back now. Well, ‘back’ is a strong term. \n(Sigh) I guess just nobody told me to stop? Melanie’s been asking about cases \nrelated to wars, so I thought... I mean, it’s not even like there’s any follow-up I \ncan do on an unofficial Italian military operation from a period in Italian history \nwhere there’s basically no records. \n(Sigh) John came by. He asked Melanie to see what she could hunt down about \nthe owners of an old depot up in Newcastle, and asked me to get him a couple \nof books on taxidermy from the library. Then he left. Again. I mean, I’m glad \nhe’s back, and I guess he seems to trust us a bit more, now, but... And-And I’m \nglad we can help, of course I am. It’s just what he’s doing seems really \ndangerous. And I get that he’s worried about us. I mean, we worry about him \nas well. \nI worry. \nAnd we should just— \nBASIRA \nCould you pass me that pen? \nMARTIN \n(Surprised) Oh, er… Hi Basira... Um, how long have you been there? \nBASIRA \n\nErm, I don’t know. Couple of hours? Why? \nMARTIN \nY-You didn’t say anything. \nBASIRA \nYeah, I was reading. \n(Martin clears his throat) \nBASIRA \nDid you need me? \nMARTIN \nNo… erm, I just... er, feel a bit… self-conscious? \nBASIRA \nAbout what? \nMARTIN \nWell, I was just, doing a statement and notes and... \nBASIRA \nAh. Was it… good? \nMARTIN \nYou weren’t listening? \nBASIRA \n\nNo, I was reading. \nMARTIN \nI just... \nBASIRA \nErm, do you want me to find somewhere else to read? Somewhere more… I \ndunno, obvious? \nMARTIN \nNo, sorry, you just surprised me, is all. \nBASIRA \nSorry. \nMARTIN \nIt’s okay. What are you reading? \nBASIRA \nIntroduction to Alchemy. It’s, um, really interesting, actually – you know a lot \nof the symbols people use come from astrology and alchemy. Like the symbol \neveryone thinks is the female symbol is actually the old astrological sign for \nVenus, which means it also means copper in alchemy. Which is kind of... What? \nMARTIN \nNothing… (nervous laugh) you just... You’ve been reading a different book \nevery time I’ve seen you for the last week. \n\nBASIRA \nWell, it’s my job now. \nMARTIN \nKinda thought your job was to be a hostage. \nBASIRA \nI mean, I guess, but… what? You want me to just sit, and mope around? \nThere’s a huge library up there…. and this stuff is kind of fascinating. \nMARTIN \nShouldn’t you be, I don’t know, trying to escape? \nBASIRA \nSure. How’s that gone for you? \nMARTIN \nWhat? \nBASIRA \nThe way Tim tells it, we’re all in the same boat here. So, how’s your escape \nplan coming? \nMARTIN \n(Confused) How… Doesn’t it bother you? \nBASIRA \n\nOf course it bothers me, but so do a lot of things I can’t change. So you make \nthe best of things. And, hey, you never know, maybe there’s something in \nthese books that can help us. \nMARTIN \nThat’s... huh, that’s not a bad point, actually. \nBASIRA \nSo, er… Do you want me to move? \nMARTIN \nNo, no, I’m just about done. You keep reading. \n[Paper shuffling] \nMARTIN \nNot much else for us to do. \n[Tape clicks off] \n[The Magnus Archives Theme – Outro] \nJONATHAN SIMS \nThe Magnus Archives is a podcast distributed by Rusty Quill and licenced under \na Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Sharealike 4.0 International \nLicense.
