You remember? You tipped us off, and we came and \nnicked your boss, the, the Bouchard bloke. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 185 – Locked In \n \n16 \nMARTIN \nOh! Oh right! The, um... oh, Inspector... I-I’m so sorry, I’ve forgotten your \nname. \nINSPECTOR \nEh-So have I. Eh-I’m just 547 in here. \nMARTIN \nGod, I’m so sorry. \nINSPECTOR \nYou’ve gotta help me! \nMARTIN \nOh. I— er… I don’t, ah— \nINSPECTOR \nI heard you! You said you were chummy with the Warden. And I need to get \nout, I-I can’t— This place— You’ve got to help me! \nARCHIVIST \nMartin? What do you think? \nMARTIN \nWhat? \nARCHIVIST \nI decided about Jordan. This place is from your past. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 185 – Locked In \n \n17 \nMARTIN \nYeah, but I mean only briefly. \nARCHIVIST \nStill. \nINSPECTOR \nPlease! Martin! Come on mate, just returning a favour, yeah? \n(Martin exhales) \nW-Wh-What’s wrong? You-You’ve got to hurry! Th-There’s not much time. \n[Martin turns fully to the Inspector] \n(Beat) \nMARTIN \nWhy are you here? \nINSPECTOR \nWhat? \nMARTIN \nWhat are you so afraid of, that you ended up in here? \nINSPECTOR \nI didn’t do anything! \nMARTIN \nJohn? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 185 – Locked In \n \n18 \n[Hissing static starts] \nARCHIVIST \nWhy are you here? \nINSPECTOR \n(Resisting) I don’t... Argh! Stop! Stop! \nARCHIVIST \nI will stop when you answer the question. \nINSPECTOR \nArgh! Look, you can’t know if they’re all guilty, alright? \n(Martin sighs) \nIt’s just about evidence… \n[Hissing static ends] \nMARTIN \n(Flatly) Right. \nINSPECTOR \nSometimes you have to… to… \nMARTIN \nWhat, guess? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 185 – Locked In \n \n19 \nINSPECTOR \nI’m sorry! Alright? \nMARTIN \nNo. You’re just afraid. \nINSPECTOR \nPlease, I’m— It’s almost lights out. I can’t be here for lights out. Not again. \nPlease? You owe me! \nARCHIVIST \nThis place is born of their nightmares. And of yours. \nMARTIN \nIf you made him a watcher, he’d become part of this place? \nARCHIVIST \nHe would. \nMARTIN \nAnd if he was... Would he enjoy it? \nINSPECTOR \nWhat are you talking about? No! Of course not! \nARCHIVIST \nYou know I can’t see the future. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 185 – Locked In \n \n20 \nMARTIN \nBut? \nARCHIVIST \nBut I can see his past. \nMARTIN \nAnd based on that? \nARCHIVIST \nHe probably would. Yes. \nINSPECTOR \nHey-hey, fuck you, you scrawny little tit! What the hell do you know? \n(Beat) \nMARTIN \nLeave him. \nINSPECTOR \nWhat? No, no, please! I didn’t mean it! \nARCHIVIST \nOkay. \n[Martin and the Archivist start walking] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 185 – Locked In \n \n21 \nINSPECTOR \n(Fading) I need your help! Please! Please! D-Don’t go away! Come back – look, \nwe can talk— we can— Please! Mark! Martin! Martin obviously! Martin please, \ncome back! Come back please! I need your help! I can’t stay here, don’t leave \nme hear, Martin! Martin! Please… \n[Walking continues] \n(Beat) \n(Martin exhales) \nMARTIN \nThat was horrible. \nARCHIVIST \nI’m sorry I put you in that position. \nMARTIN \nNo, you were right to. That’s… that’s a lot of power to have to deal with. Lot of \nresponsibility. \nARCHIVIST \nYes. Thank you, Uncle Ben. \nMARTIN \n(Chuckle) Pop culture? Really? \nARCHIVIST \nI'm allowed to know what Spiderman is. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 185 – Locked In \n \n22 \n(A short sigh from Martin) \nMARTIN \nNot helping people is still a decision, isn’t it? \nARCHIVIST \nWell, you saw Jordan, I’m not sure ‘helping’ is really— \nMARTIN \nI know, I know, not the right word. Ignoring them then. \nARCHIVIST \nYes. \nIt’s a choice I’ve been making a lot recently. \nMARTIN \nI guess we should get used to it. Knowing that all these awful things are \nhappening for our benefit. \nARCHIVIST \nMaybe it’s better if it never gets comfortable. \nMARTIN \nMaybe. \n[They walk in silence for a while] \n[Strange static sound starts] \n[There is less echo from the prison walls as Martin speaks]", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 5, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 3871}}
