I \ndon’t know where I got the gun, but once Captain Macaby was dead the others \nwere very keen to sail wherever I wanted. The doom held me tight and pulled \nus all slowly, inevitably, towards our grave. And when we got there, we cut the \nengines and began to wait. I could feel all of their eyes look to me, panicked, \nhoping for some sort of explanation. \nI almost tried to give them one, but I barely got the first word out before the \nfalling satellite debris hit the ship at 200 miles an hour, killing us instantly. \nOLIVER \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 121 – Far Away \n \n11 \n \nRight. That’s it, I suppose. Maybe you heard me. Maybe you’ll dream.

Easier to just do what she asks. \nThe thing is, John, right now, you have a choice. You’ve put it off a long time, \nbut it’s trapping you here. You’re not quite human enough to die, but still too \nhuman to survive. You’re balanced on an edge where The End can’t touch you, \nbut you can’t escape him. I made a choice. We all make choices. Now you have \nt— \n[Door opens and faint hospital noises can be heard] \nGEORGIE \n(Suspicious) Can I help you? \nOLIVER \nUh, uh, I’m a friend… of John’s. \nGEORGIE \nAre you now? \nOLIVER \nY-y-yes. \nGEORGIE \nRight. Just… haven’t seen you visiting before. \nOLIVER \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 121 – Far Away \n \n12 \n \nI’ve been out of town. \nGEORGIE \nRight. (Pause) The nurse didn’t say anyone else was here. \nOLIVER \nOh, oh, oh, well… Sorry if I surprised you. \nGEORGIE \nIt’s fine. \nOLIVER \nI’m Antonio. \nGEORGIE \nSure. \nOLIVER \nDo you mind, um, giving us a minute? \nGEORGIE \nNo, I think you’re done here. \nOLIVER \nOh, uh, right. Have I upset you, miss? \nGEORGIE \nNo, you just remind me of someone. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 121 – Far Away \n \n13 \n \nOLIVER \nAh. I’m sorry, were they— \nGEORGIE \nEvil, yes. \nOLIVER \nOh. Okay, then. I… I just, uh, I guess I should just go. \nGEORGIE \nI guess you should. \nOLIVER \n(To Archivist) Make your choice, John. \n[Door opens and closes; Georgie exhales] \nGEORGIE \nSorry about that. But you really don’t need friends like tha— … Did...? \n[Door opens] \nGEORGIE (BACKGROUND) \nHey! Hey, get back here, I need to talk to you! \n[Door closes] \n[Ticking of clock continues.
