Even if that sliver of paranoia, \nthat vague wrongness you couldn’t quite place wouldn’t count as a mark, it \nwas only a matter of time before it confronted you in a far more direct and \naffecting matter. Admittedly, given the advent of the Unknowing, I needn’t \nhave bothered. But what’s the old saying about hindsight? More important to \nme was Sasha’s encounter with the Distortion. If it had taken an interest, then I \nvery much wanted it to cross your path. \nSo I found one of its current victims and convinced her to make a statement. \nPoor Helen. I actually had to put her in a taxi myself, she was getting so lost on \nthose narrow London side streets. It worked, though. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 160 – The Eye Opens \n \n16 \nBetween the stabbing and at least two desperate flights into its door, you’re \nmarked very deep by the Spiral. \nJurgen Leitner was a surprise, of course, and I was forced to… improvise. I had \nno idea how much Gertrude would have told him, and he could very easily \nhave derailed everything if you learned too much too fast. I.. justified it to \nmyself saying I was going to have to send you out into the world anyway, if you \nwere to encounter more of the Powers, but I can’t honestly pretend it wasn’t \na... rather rash move. \nStill. I’d requested Detective Tonner be assigned to the case when they found \nGertrude’s body in the hope that having a Hunter in the mix would eventually \nlead to a confrontation, and setting you up as a killer certainly hastened that. \nThen it was just a matter of feeding you statements to lead you to a few \navatars I thought were likely to harm you, but probably would stop short of \nactually killing you. \nJude served her purpose exactly as I had hoped, as did our dearly departed Mr \nCrew, marking you for the Desolation and the Vast. Honestly, I had nothing to \ndo with Melanie and her Slaughter adventure, but when I saw the situation, I \nmade sure to trap her here, so whenever her rage bubbled over you were right \nthere, a ready target. I didn’t foresee the mark coming from surgery gone \nwrong, but it was a very pleasant surprise. \nThe Unknowing was a distraction, but not an unwelcome one. For this to work, \nyou needed more than just the marks; you needed power. And that was \nsomething the Unknowing served to test, though it posed no actual danger in \nthe grand scheme of things. And it did serve another purpose, of course. It \ninadvertently pushed you to confront death, a mark I had been very worried \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 160 – The Eye Opens \n \n17 \nabout trying to orchestrate. If I tried too early, you’d just die. Too late, and you \nmight be powerful enough to see the attempt coming, and maybe even \nunderstand why. As it was, it was just right, and once again, you came through \nwith flying colours. By this point, your abilities were coming on in leaps and \nbounds, and I was concerned that meeting face-to-face might end up with you \nknowing something you shouldn’t. I had initially planned to go into hiding but, \nwhen your colleagues surprised me with the police, well. It was simple enough \nto cut a deal. \nAll that remained, then, were the Dark, the Flesh, the Buried, and the Lonely. I \nwas a little put out when that idiot Jared Hopworth misinterpreted my letters \nand attacked the Institute too soon, before you were even out of the hospital, \nbut then, ho! You should have seen my face when you voluntarily went to him. \nI couldn’t see what happened in there, of course, but given how you came out, \nI’m very sure it counts as a mark. \nI suspected the coffin might turn up again, and once it did, it was simply a \nmatter of getting any, uh... restraining factors you might have had flying off on \na wild goose chase, and waiting. Honestly, Detective Tonner has been proving \ninvaluable through this whole process. I was racking my brains for months \nabout what I could use to lure you in. And, of course, I knew the Dark Sun was \njust sitting there waiting. So when it came time, I whipped up another \napocalypse and sent you on your merry way. \nThen all that remained was the Lonely. Poor Peter. He really should have left \nwell enough alone. (cruel laugh) Or just done what I asked in the first place. Ah \nwell. He knew what I was attempting and was very unwilling to cooperate until \nI made him a little wager about Martin.
