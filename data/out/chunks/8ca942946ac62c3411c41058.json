He said it was the only \nway he'd found to stop it dripping down and ruining his shirts. \nI was a bit freaked out at this. Understandably, I think, though it was entirely \nmy own fault, and I had told him he needed to see a doctor if his ears wouldn't \nstop bleeding. Lee just shook his head, said he'd seen enough doctors to know \nthey couldn't help, and that he had learned to copewith it. We drank the rest \nof the night in silence, before heading our separate ways. I know I should have \nleft it alone after that, and I certainly didn't bother Lee again. But I found I, I \njust couldn't let it go. Either Lee was mad, or Grifter's Bone was real. I started \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG042 – Grifter’s Bone \n6 \n \ndoing research online. There were a few sites that referenced it as an urban \nlegend. There was a punk duo in Oregon who proudly announced that they had \nnamed themselves Grifter's Bone after what they described as “Britain's \nmusical Jack the Ripper”. There were a lot of posts on music forums from \nnewbies to the scene asking what Grifter's Bone was. But nowhere had \nanything even remotely like Lee's story. \nFinally, having kinda run out of steam, I threw my findings together into a short \nfeature article, and sent it to Tommy, who dutifully approved it. I figured I'd \nwasted enough time on the subject that I could at least put it towards \nsomething decent for the site. It did alright, though it wasn't enough of a hit to \njustify the time spent on it. Lee didn't mention it when we next talked – I had \nasked if I could write up his experience after thoroughly anonymising it, and \nhe'd shrugged and said fine. All in all, it felt like whatever it was that had \nhooked me, it was over, and I wasn't too broken up about it. \nThen someone left a comment on my article. It just read, “Tonight. Soho.” I \nwouldn't have paid it any attention if it hadn't been for the second line: “No \nearplugs required”. Lee's earplugs, and the reason behind them, had been the \nonly thing he requested I leave out of the article. I mentioned it to Tommy, and \nhe just said something about time-wasters, and how I had better things to do \nthan spend an evening wandering around Soho, randomly walking into music \nvenues. \nIt probably says something really depressing about my personal life that, \nactually, I didn't have anything better to do. So that afternoon I was doing \nexactly that. Wandering around the streets of Soho, making a note of all the \nperformers listed as playing that night. As expected, none of them listed \nGrifter's Bone as playing, but I made a note of them anyway. It wasn't that late, \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG042 – Grifter’s Bone \n7 \n \nbut it was already dark, the world illuminated by the colourful glow of the Soho \nsigns and shop fronts. \nThe wind was slow in the narrow streets, but still cut through my thin, woollen \ncoat as I wandered, looking for a small, cruel-looking man in a ragged brown \nsuit. I'd kept my watch maybe an hour when I saw someone staring at me from \nthe doorway of a small shop. The sign above didn't have an obvious name, \nsimply reading “Crystals. Books. Tarot”. He was tall, black and careworn, deep \nlines of worry etched into an otherwise handsome face. When he saw me \nlooking at him, he began to walk up to me, still with that intense look. I took a \ncouple of steps back, and asked if I could help him. He shook his head as if \nunsure what to say, then asked me what I was listening to. A chill ran over me \nas I realised he was staring at my ears. \nI said I wasn't listening to anything, as I wasn't wearing headphones, and asked \nhim what he wanted. He shook his head again, and mumbled something about \nprotecting my hearing. He turned away then, and started walking back into the \nshop. I was about to follow him when I saw a small group of people turning the \ncorner. \nTheir features were hard to be sure of in the dark, but walking at the front, \ndragging a rolling keyboard case, was a short, thin man in an oversized brown \nsuit. The three figures behind him were all much taller than him, but each was \nstick thin and moved with a jerkiness to their motions. I looked back to where \nthe strange, staring man had been, but he had retreated inside his shop, and \nthe lights were now off, so I began to follow the man I thought to be Alfred \nGrifter as he and his companions moved down the street. The others all carried \ninstrument cases as well, and no one else on the street seemed", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 3, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 4499}}
