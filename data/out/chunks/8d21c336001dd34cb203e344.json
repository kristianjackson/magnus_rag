But He is the son of God and we are merely sons of the dirt. We are \nnot as strong as He is, and we deserve rest. We deserve to sleep. \nI’ve been trying to sleep, but that bell kept ringing, the one over Jacob the baker’s \ngrave. That nonsense safety valve the Reverend insisted on putting there, ringing \nand ringing, and disturbing the sleep of everyone in the churchyard. I’ve no doubt \nit disturbed Jacob as well, who worked so hard all his life and never thought to \ncomplain of his lot. \nHe deserved to rest. So I cut the cord. And now he is quiet. \nI can’t get my clothes clean anymore. And my shovel is never far from my hand. \nYours, \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 152 – A Gravedigger’s Envy \n10 \n \nHezekiah \nJanuary, 1839 \nI am disappointed, Nathaniel, I’ll not deny it. More than that, I am hurt. My letters \nto you have always been a comfort to my soul, a place where I may lay my heart \nbare and tell the truths of what I think and feel without fear of judgment or \nreproach. That you chose to share what last I wrote you with the magistrates has \nwounded me sore. \nThey came and asked their questions, as I’m sure you hoped they would, but \ncould of course prove nothing. Jacob is long dead, and I was very careful how I \nstopped the bell. \nBut such suspicions eat away at peace, and of course the Reverend dismissed me. \nI’ve lost my churchyard, Nathaniel, and I wonder if I shall ever sleep again. \nIt was my own fault, of course – I should never have told you these things \nassuming you would understand. But how could you? You’ve never felt the close \nembrace of peaceful soil. You’ve never truly slept in the bosom of the earth. \nThese things are not such as can be shared in words, and it was my foolishness to \nthink that they could. \nBut worry not, Nathaniel. The love I bear you will not let me leave you ignorant. \nAs I did with the Reverend, I will come and I will show you, once and forever, the \ntrue and glorious peace of the Buried. \nYour most humble servant, \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 152 – A Gravedigger’s Envy \n11 \n \nHezekiah Wakeley \nARCHIVIST \nStatement ends. \nNathaniel Beale is buried on the grounds of St. Peter’s Church in his hometown of \nDunstable. And I am only the third person to know that in almost 200 years, after \nNathaniel Beale himself, and Mr. Wakeley, the person who buried him. \nI cannot tell how much of the change that comes over someone when they are \ntaken by one of the Fears is a direct product of their influence, and how much is \ntheir own mind, desperately contorting itself to accept and justify the awful things \nthey find themselves drawn to doing. \nI have read many statements now by those who are changing, who are becoming \n– something else, and few if any of them seem… entirely rational. Entirely the \npeople that they were before. \nBut how can I tell, I suppose. My job is to view people at their lowest, their most \nfearful and unstable moments. Perhaps there is less change there than I imagine. \nCertainly, I don’t feel different. I have no desire for pseudo-religious \nphilosophizing, or delighting in the suffering of those I harm. \nThen again, I suppose I’m hardly in the best position to judge. Perhaps to anyone \nlistening to these tapes I sound remarkably similar to Hezekiah. Or to Manuela. Or \nto Jane. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 152 – A Gravedigger’s Envy \n12 \n \n[Tape clicks off. Tape clicks on. There is a dripping sound. A door creaks open. \nWe hear the static associated with The Distortion.] \nHELEN \nHello, John. Been a while since you’ve been down here. \nARCHIVIST \n(Impatient noise) I didn’t come here to see you. \nHELEN \nOh, come now! I’m sure I’m more interesting company than the late Jane \nPrentiss. \nARCHIVIST \nIt’s all that’s left of her now – apart from a jar of ashes in my desk. Just a circle of \nrotten stone on an otherwise-unremarkable wall. \nHELEN \nMore of a legacy than some people get. \nARCHIVIST \nThere was going to be a gate, I think. A hole that she rotted into the Corruption \nitself. Maybe the start of a ritual? \nHELEN \nHmm. Not exactly impressive, is it?", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 4, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 4110}}
