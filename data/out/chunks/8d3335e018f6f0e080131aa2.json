She has spent the last twenty of those years acutely aware and in \nconstant dread of a death she believed to be imminent. \nThe earliest she can remember being certain that she was about to die was \nwhen, at the age of fifteen due to a chronic case of acid reflux, she decided \nthat she had a malignant intestinal tumour. She would spend whole nights \nlying awake, imagining it lurking there, growing. Spreading. Blocking her organs \nand preparing to kill her. Danika knew the whole thing was ridiculous, of \ncourse, and did not visit a doctor about it, simply assuming it would be \ndiscovered when she finally collapsed. She diagnosed herself with a year to \nlive, at most. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 168 – Roots \n12 \nAt the age of sixteen, she contracted a case of acute gastroenteritis which \nknotted her guts so severely that she had to have several scans taken by a \nbuzzing hospital machine. Young Danika lay there on the hospital bed, waiting \nfor the stern-faced doctor to come in and tell her what she already knew: that \nshe had months, at most, to live. When they said no such thing, talking about \nher treatment for her decidedly non-fatal condition, an incredible sense of joy \nbegan to overtake her. A deep and profound relief. There was nothing there. \nShe wasn't going to die! She was going to have a life. \nAt least, for the next three months, which was how long it took her to find a \nlump in her chest that she decided was fatal breast cancer. This one, she did \nget checked out, and was told in no uncertain terms that it was a harmless \ncyst. But she knew they'd missed something. Clearly the cyst had distracted \nthem, causing them to miss the actual tumour. But she couldn't go back. No \ndoubt she'd be dead within a year. Two, at most. \nAnd so it continued for the next two decades of her life. She started smoking at \nthe age of seventeen, battling with the addiction her whole life, and not once \nwas there a chesty cough that she did not decide was lung cancer. When she \nhad her first panic attack at age twenty-three, she was absolutely certain that \nshe was having a stroke. Every dizzy spell was a sign of MS; every achy leg was \na fatal blood clot. She never feared an epidemic or a plague, and the thought \nof infection rarely troubled her, because she knew that whatever was about to \nimminently kill her was going to rise up from deep inside her own body. \nFor her whole life, as each milestone of adulthood passed, Danika never \nbelieved that she would live more than two years further. Every relationship \nwas tinged with a melancholic guilt that she would leave them so soon. Every \nachievement overshadowed by the certainty she wouldn't be around to enjoy", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 2, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 2720}}
