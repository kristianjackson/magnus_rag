But then the responses start to breakdown, become more sinister and \nkeep referring to how much pain Sergei is in. Eventually, the only response the \nbot gives you is screaming and pleas to be released. \nThe idea is that the chatbot is Sergei Yushanka’s mind and he doesn’t like being \nin a computer nearly as much as he’d hoped. If it’s well-executed it can be \ngenuinely quite unsettling. The only two consistent details across all of them \nare a particular image of a heavily pixelated screaming face and the phrase, \n“The angles cut me when I try to think”, which marks the start of the bot’s \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 065 – Binary \n8 \n \ndescent into madness. Well, as far as I know, these two things have been \nconsistent right back to the earliest versions of Sergei Yushanka. \nLike I say, it’s quite a niche legend, but within certain communities everyone’s \ntried their hand at making a Sergei Yushanka at least once. Well, even I looked \ninto it once or twice and I’m only really on the fringes. I’ve done a few projects \nwith basic neural nets, but I’d never really tried my hand at a chatbot and gave \nup after a couple of hours. I used to love them. The whole thing really hit my \nsweet spot between creepy and nerdy and if I found myself up at four in the \nmorning after watching too many YouTube ghost videos, I’d often go on the \nhunt for a new one. \nSo when I got a notification from the bot group I’m part of and it was just a link \nto a file named YushankasDespair.exe, I didn’t hesitate. I downloaded it almost \nimmediately. It was a bit disappointing to see it was a tiny file, barely over a \nmegabyte. That didn’t bode well for the experience, but I was still keen to give \nit a go later that night when the ambience was better. I looked back at the post \nand saw that underneath it was comment after comment telling the OP that \nthey’d posted a broken link. I shrugged it off at the time, but looking back I \nthink I was probably the first person to click it and the only one it worked for. \nJust unlucky, I guess. \nI forgot about it for a while, but I didn’t have anything scheduled for the next \nday, so I spent most of the evening drinking and messing about online. It was \nabout two in the morning when I remembered what I had waiting in my \ndownloads. I looked out at the dark, empty street below and a pleasing shiver \nran up my spine. I decided I was in the perfect mood to have a chat with Sergei \nYushanka. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 065 – Binary \n9 \n \nOpening up the program brought up a chat window. It wasn’t like most of the \nothers I’d seen. It looked closer to an old school text adventure, with just a \nflashing line to indicate where to type your text, white on black. Aside from \nthat, the window was empty. I wasn’t exactly sure what to do, as usually the \nbot would make the first move, so I decided to go with the generic, “Hello”. \nThere was no way that the bot didn’t have a response programmed for that. I \nwaited, but there didn’t seem to be any response. That was fine. Often these \nthings were programmed with waiting times to give the impression of thinking \nor composing a response. After about 15 seconds, I’m about to give it up as \nnon-functional and close it, when the answer comes. It’s gibberish, just a mess \nof symbols and letters, like it was using the wrong characters. Well, some of \nthem weren’t even ASCII. \nI didn’t have time to really process it though as they were generating quickly \nand soon filled the whole screen. They weren’t static either, but changing and \nscrolling and, um... it’s going to sound weird, and it was only for a moment, but \nI could have sworn I saw some of the symbols twitch, like they were in pain. \nIt was making my eyes hurt to watch and I started to feel dizzy, but I couldn’t \nbring myself to look away. Even then, I thought I was just looking at a very \nwell-done horror set piece, especially when I started to notice a handful of \nEnglish words popping into the wall of shifting text for a second or two at a \ntime. One of them read ‘‘helphelphelp’’, all run together, and another, “it peels \nmy mind like knives”. My mouth was dry and my hand was shaking, but even \nthen all I could think was how good this was. I was genuinely impressed by how \nunsettled it was making me. \nIt was the laptop’s fan that finally got me.
