Original statement given 3rd March 2009. Audio \nrecording by Jonathan Sims, Head Archivist of the Magnus Institute, London. \nStatement begins. \nARCHIVIST (STATEMENT) \nLast year I moved to the small town of Bucoda, about 15 miles outside of \nOlympia in the State of Washington. I’d never heard of the town before, and I \ncertainly had no idea about what I would soon start to think of as… ‘The Pit’. \nThe choice to move was not entirely mine, as my circumstances had driven me \ninto a very particular situation. I had moved out to Olympia from Pittsburgh to \npursue what appeared to be a very promising job as a correspondent for a \nregional newspaper. There weren't a lot of opportunities in my field, so when I \nwas offered the position in Olympia, I had used all my savings to make the \nmove. \nI never got the full story on why the paper closed down so quickly. One person \ntold me they'd gone bankrupt due to embezzlement at a high level, another \n\nclaimed there was a huge libel suit and they'd lost it badly, and a third said the \ndecision had been made by their parent company without warning. Whatever \nthe reason, I turned up to my first day of work to find the office halfway \nthrough being disassembled. I hadn't technically started my job yet, so there \nwas no redundancy or severance. I was just… stranded in Olympia with no \nmoney and no obvious place to go. It didn’t help matters that my new landlord \nproved entirely unsympathetic to my situation. \nSince, even if I got a new job immediately, I’d be unable to make the next rent \npayment on the rather overpriced apartment in the city centre. He told me I \nwas in breach of contract, and was to be evicted. He gave me three days. \nSo, I ended up in a place where I desperately needed to find somewhere very \ncheap to live, very quickly. Somewhere I could stay while I looked for another \njob. My parents were dirt poor themselves, and couldn’t help. I mean, I’m sure \nthey’d have taken me back in, but I didn’t have the money to travel across half \nthe country, especially not with all my stuff. You never realise how many \npossessions you have until you find them weighing you down, or how little \nvalue most of them have to anyone but you. I sold what I could, but I got less \nthan fifty dollars, and had barely got rid of anything. \nSo when I got chatting to Tommy in a bar, two days before I was getting kicked \nout, and he told me he had a spare room he was looking to rent out on the \ncheap, I said yes almost before he’d given me any details about it. Thomas \nKrycek was young, blandly handsome, and not desperately bright. He seemed \nlike a good sort, though. He’d bought a small one-storey home in the town of \nBucoda with his partner a few years ago, but she’d split a month or two before, \nand now he was struggling to keep up the payments on the house. It wasn’t \nmuch, but it fit what might be generously be called my ‘budget’, and Bucoda \nwas less than an hour’s drive from Olympia, so commuting in to any job I might \nactually get wouldn’t be too bad. I shook his hand, and I moved there. \nThe town was almost exactly what you would expect. A small grid without \ntraffic signs or markings, patches of grass and dirt with small houses irregularly \ndotted about. What infrastructure there was boasted only volunteers, and I’d \nbe surprised if there was more than five hundred people in total who called it \nhome.
