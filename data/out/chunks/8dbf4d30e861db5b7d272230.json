According \nto those who follow such things, all you had to do was start a new thread as a \nguest – something that Greg had been instructed to make sure was possible – \nand the title of that thread should be the name of someone you want dead. \nAs the stories went, you would receive a reply almost immediately and it \nwould simply ask you for a story. You would have to write out and post, in full, \na horrible event that had happened to you or someone that you loved. All the \ninstructions were very clear that the target would only die if the account \nsatisfied the “story-spinner”. None of them made any mention of what \nhappened if it did not. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 123 - Web Development \n16 \n \nPretty standard fare spooky stuff. At least, I would have thought so, if it hadn’t \nbeen for the messages that Greg kept getting. Someone more technically \nadept than him had clearly found his email associated with the site and had \nposted about it, so he had become the de facto mailbox for this… forum. Greg \nswore blind the site had never received any visitors at all, never had a single \nthing posted in it, but still the emails came: ‘Bring them back’; ‘What is \nhappening?’; ‘I’m sorry I lied’. \nIt’s been getting to him; I know it has. He’s lost weight. He rarely goes out \nanymore and, judging by the cobwebs, he definitely doesn’t clean his house \nlike he used to. I’ve tried talking to him, but it’s like talking to a brick wall that \nrefuses to admit it’s crumbling. That’s why it’s me here, rather than him. I \nmean, I had to talk to someone. \nWe were walking home from The Cricketers, a pub just off Horsell Birch. We \nwere heading back to his house, since I’d missed my last train and, when that \nhappened, I tended to sleep on his sofa. We were turning down into his road, \nwhen there was a small voice from a doorway next to us, asking for help. Now, \nthe last few years there have been a lot more homeless folk around Woking. I \nknow, welcome to Tory Britain, but my point is that Greg usually made a habit \nof giving whatever change he had left over from the pub to whoever we \nstumbled across on the way back. So, when we heard this, he turned towards \nthe voice and held out his hand towards the dark, crumpled shape, offering \nsome change. \nWhat grabbed his wrist was not a hand. Not exactly. Not anymore. It was \ncoarse and bony, and covered in fine, sharp hairs. Greg screamed, falling \nbackwards, pulling the figure under the streetlamp, where, for a second, I saw \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 123 - Web Development \n17 \n \nit more completely than he did. It was definitely human once, at least based on \nhow it was screaming, but it was thin, with bits of it twisted and discoloured, \ncovered in small, scurrying shapes. \nIts face was the most human part of it remaining, except for the two black and \nhollow spaces where its eyes once were. From which now poured an endless \nstream of scuttling legs and fangs. The mouth was full of them too, but I could \nsee, as they grasped desperately at Greg, it was trying to say, ‘I’m sorry. I’m \nsorry. Tell her I’m sorry.’ But words were not what tumbled from those lips. \nWe ran, of course. The thing was frantic, but clumsy, and it wasn’t difficult to \nget away. I wanted to go to the police, to tell them everything, but Greg \nrefused, of course. He said there must have been some mistake, that it was \njust ‘a tramp with an unfortunate condition’, that he wasn’t going to bother \nthe police just because we’d had a bit of a shock. I didn’t have the energy to \nargue with him. I still don’t, really. \nI don’t know what to think. Greg’s my best friend, but I might have to stop \nseeing him. He’s still working on that site, still updating the domain name, still \npasting gibberish into the code. I think he might be a part of something really \nawful, and I don’t know how to make him see that. If I had a little bit more \ncourage, I might just hang around a few message boards I know, waiting for a \nlink to The Chelicerae, waiting to post a name that might end it. I’ve got a story \nfor it, alright. \nBut I won’t. I’m just too much of a coward, I suppose, so I guess I’m telling it to \nyou instead. For all the good that’ll do. \nARCHIVIST", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 4, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 4255}}
