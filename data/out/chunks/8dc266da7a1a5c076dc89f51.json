This time my words came out crisp and clear, and \nas I said them I noticed fewer and fewer of the parishioners seemed to be in \nthe pews. Hope began to rise within me as it seemed the words would work to \nbanish these jaundiced watchers and I pressed on. Finally, the pews were \nempty, and my heart soared as I turned towards the tabernacle to retrieve the \nrest of the host. \nIt was strange, the rich cloth curtain that covered that ornate metal box \nseemed stuck, so I pulled and pulled and eventually it came free. I opened the \ndoor and retrieved the Host, returning it to the altar. Then I... I lifted it to my \nmouth, and I ate. It did not taste as I expected. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG020 – Desecrated Host \n8 \n \nI’m sure you’ve guessed the reality of what it was I was eating. I don’t even \nknow where I was, some dingy basement from what it seemed when the light \nfell from my eyes and I returned to reality. At least, I assume this is reality. I \ndream, sometimes, that perhaps this is the illusion – my arrest and \nimprisonment merely a hallucination. That I’m not a murdering cannibal. \nIt doesn’t matter. At that moment, seeing those bound corpses before me, I \nmade the decision to take no action ever again. I will not commit the further \nsin of ending my life, but I sat there until the police came. I pled guilty to all the \ncharges they laid before me, and now here I am, doubting everything I see and \nhear. I do worry about the state of my soul, of course, but there is little to be \ndone. My old colleagues have come by on occasion, and even the Bishop once, \nbut it doesn’t help. Whatever they may be actually be saying, all I can hear is \nthe sound of the bell. \nThank you for your time. \nJONATHAN SIMS \nStatement ends. \nAs it turns out the second part of this statement was simply misfiled in the next \nfolder, which was useful, although it does beg the question of who was reading \nit last? Martin is still absent, but Tim and Sasha both swear they haven’t seen it \nbefore. Was my predecessor reading it at some point? That seems unlikely \ngiven the state of the place; I find it hard to credit the idea that Gertrude \nRobinson actually read any of these files. Still, it’s hardly our biggest concern. \nIt’s difficult to know where to begin with a statement like this. If the person \ngiving their testimony is unable to distinguish the real and the unreal, that \ndoesn’t usually bode well for anyone trying to find evidence. Let us begin with \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG020 – Desecrated Host \n9 \n \nBethany O’Connor. From what Sasha could find in the records of St Hugh’s \nCollege, she was indeed a student with them, studying archaeology, \nmatriculating in 2008. Everything Father Burroughs says about her faith, her \nhospitalisation and her death appears to match up with official records. \nHowever, college records appear to list her as one of the students living in halls \nduring her second year, rather than in an off-campus house, and it was a \nporter who she attacked with a kitchen knife, rather than a housemate. In fact, \naccording to the letting agent, there was no-one living at 89 Bullingdon Road \nthat year, so whatever Bethany was doing in that house, it wasn’t living there \nlegally. \nFather Burroughs’ old colleagues from the Church certainly remember his \nfalling apart following the failed exorcism. They were apparently in the process \nof talking to the Bishop to get him some help when the ‘culminating incident’ \noccurred that led to his incarceration. Prior to meeting Bethany O’Connor, \nnone of them had anything but the highest praise for the man. \nAs for the incident itself, Father Burroughs was found in one of the back rooms \nof 89 Bullingdon Road. He was wearing a butcher’s apron and sat in front of \ntwo students, Christopher Bilham and James Mann. They were both tied to \nchairs and quite dead. Cause of death was listed as blood loss from multiple \nlacerations all over their legs and torso, as well as removal of both their faces \nwith a sharp blade, possibly a scalpel. The face of James Mann was found to \nhave been partially eaten by Father Burroughs. He pled guilty to all charges \nbrought before him and is currently serving two life sentences at Wakefield \nPrison, though HMPS refused our request for a follow-up interview. \nWhat interests me is the paralleling of Father Burroughs’ climactic \nhallucination with reality, and the fact that at no point did he perform any", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 4, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 4470}}
