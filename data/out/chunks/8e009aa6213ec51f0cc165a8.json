I still might; I'm not sure. He doesn't really \nmake contact when we don't have a job and this one ended badly enough that \nI'm not sure whether or not I'm getting another call. I hope so. I really don't \nwant to be a teacher. He first contacted me three years after funding fell \nthrough for my second PhD and some professional disputes meant that the \nchances of my career continuing were somewhere between zero and no. He \nwas very to the point with me, explaining right away that he organised rapid \nturnaround illegal digs, taking whatever high value finds were transportable \nand selling them to private collectors. He had plenty of labour, security and \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 064 – Burial Rites \n \n4 \n \norganisational support, but he needed someone on staff to identify and quickly \nappraise artefacts or other discoveries. He had previously had a disgraced \nanthropology professor from Harvard, but he'd apparently been busted \nsmuggling a few extras through Customs in China and was no longer available. \nStavo said I was just the right choice to fill the position. \nI agreed on the spot. I never did do great with the ethical aspects of my field. I \nlove the hunt, the research and the discovery, but to be honest, expanding the \nbody of mankind's knowledge or helping a culture connect with its roots has \nnever been high on my priority list. Certainly not as high as money. \nSo for the next few years I travelled the globe with Stavo and his team. There \nwas me, a geologist I'll call Grigori, Norman, who was the middleman to \nvarious antiques dealers, auction houses and less respectful museums, and a \npair of quiet Albanians, Barry and Paul, who acted as the muscle. Well, they did \nthe majority of it, but Stavo didn't like it when people put their feet up on a \njob, so me, Grigori and Norman spent most of the time working a spade \nalongside them, as our expertise generally came in useful in the latter half of \nthe dig. I like to think I earned my keep. Certainly, there were plenty of times \nBarry was all set to toss out some priceless treasure because he took it for \ndusty trash. And Stavo never complained. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 064 – Burial Rites \n \n5 \n \nThis last dig was high risk. Stavo and Norman had ears in the appropriate \noffices of most universities and museums, so we got word that the Egyptian \ngovernment had denied permission for the University of Pennsylvania to look \ninto a possible tomb complex located between Cairo and the Red Sea. Again, I \nwon't go into specifics, but it was right in the middle of the Eastern Desert, a \ngood 30 or 40 miles from the closest known explored pyramid or tomb. If the \nuniversity researchers were right, this place could be both a significant find \nand, more importantly for us, completely untouched. \nIt was dangerous though. When a government denied permission like this, you \ncould never be sure that they weren't going to send people of their own \ninstead, and Stavo had plenty of stories of ex-colleagues that had got \nthemselves inadvertently arrested when the military abruptly turned up to \nsecure a dig site. Still, the opportunity was too good to pass up and Stavo had \nsome contacts within the Cairo police force, so was able to get us a pair of \nwell-bribed policemen to stick around and give us at least a passing air of \nrespectability for any civilian who might stumble across us. So off I went to \nEgypt, dreaming of finding a new pyramid. I know that sounds daft, but most \npyramids are not as huge, obvious or intact as those at Giza. After four or five \nthousand years, most of just look like hills or sometimes dunes and there could \nbe any number of them waiting undiscovered beneath the Egyptian earth.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 1, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 3761}}
