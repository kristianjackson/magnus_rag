I said yes, why \nnot, and let her go through. As I stood there alone, waiting, I began to feel \nsomething I had never before felt this far underground. I began to feel uneasy. \nIt was as silent as it had ever been, but there was something else there, \nbeneath the silence. Almost like a whisper. \nI shook the feeling off when it came time to follow Alena, and dived into the \npool. It wasn’t far to the junction which would lead us on to the Gavel Pot. I \npressed myself through the narrow space, half swimming, half climbing, until I \nthought I had gone far enough, and attempted to surface. Clunk. My helmet hit \nlightly against the roof of the tunnel. Fine, that was as expected. I kept \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG015 – Lost John’s Cave \n8 \n \nswimming another few meters and tried again. Clunk. That gave me a nasty \nshock, as I should have been well past the end of this first tunnel. I kept going, \nuntil I reached the end of the subterranean waterway, and went towards the \nsurface. Clunk. I started to panic. Was this a dead end? There was no further I \ncould go. Where was Alena? She couldn’t have come back past me; the tunnel \nwas far too narrow. In desperation I tried to come up one more time. \nI broke the surface to see Alena laughing to herself, and holding a rock over the \npart of the water where I had been trying to emerge. I swore at her violently, \nnot sure whether to hit her or join in her laughing. She apologised, but said she \nhad seen the rock and couldn’t resist, as I was always going on about the \nhelmet banging on the roof. I sat there, suddenly drained. The adrenaline of \nmy panic seemed to have sapped much of my energy, and I think my sister \ncould see that, as she didn’t press me to go on. We both knew that the passage \nthrough from this junction to the Gavel Pot itself was a much longer dive, and \nneither of us was really up to it. We just sat there for a while in silence. \nIt had taken longer to get this far than we had planned, so I suggested going \nback the way we came, rather than continuing to go deeper into the cave. \nAlena agreed but, as I turned away, she asked me how lost I was in a low, \ngrating voice. I snapped back that we weren’t lost at all, that I’d followed the \nmap exactly, and she just gave me this look like she didn’t understand what I \nwas talking about. I shrugged and told her that I would go first on the way \nback, and she agreed. I was eager to get back and be above ground in a way \nthat I had never been before. I got my equipment ready and dived back into \nthe water, heading back towards Death’s Head Hole. \nThat’s when everything started to go really, really wrong…", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 4, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 2785}}
