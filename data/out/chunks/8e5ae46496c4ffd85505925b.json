It was an isolated place and the folk who had still been living \nthere were on the older side, with little real connection to the outside world. I \nguess the media doesn’t really care about crofters, especially once the police \nhad swept up the more gory details. \nI moved back to Macclesfield shortly afterwards. It pretty much ended my \nmarriage, since my wife is why I moved up to Inverness in the first place, but I \njust couldn’t go on up there. I can’t stand the sound of bagpipes. And \nsometimes, at night, I still hear sheep in the distance. \nARCHIVIST \nStatement ends. \nHm, an Englishman returning from Scotland with a fear of bagpipes and sheep. \nI’m sure we can all relate. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 125 – Civilian Casualties \n \n9 \n \nIn many ways, The Slaughter fascinates me. There seems to be in all cases a \nquestion at its heart about control. Is it a mindless dance, dragging participants \nalong by the beat of a drum? Or is there a kernel of will in there, a lucidity and \ndeliberateness to the random fury and violence? I suppose that’s the question \nwith so much of violence, war. How much are you really in command of \nyourself, or of others? I’m not sure what scares me more, the idea that deep \ndown everyone is in complete control of their actions, that everything is on \nsome level intentional, or that ultimately, we don’t have any control over \nourselves at all, and the rest is just rationalisation. \nAnother Leitner, obviously. Not one I can readily identify, though it sounds like \nit would now be inert anyway. Given the blank pages, I do wonder whether its \ndestruction was a last-ditch effort to stop its effects, or the exact thing that \nreleased its power in such an extreme way. \nRegardless, I’ve hit another research dead end with this. It’s frustrating, to be \nhonest. I finally feel myself – I feel focused and ready – and I find myself \nbasically alone. \nI’m now sure Martin is actually avoiding me. Basira was right about the \nInstitute being watched, though. In the last week, I’ve seen two different \npeople wearing symbols for the People’s Church of the Divine Host, and it’s \nrare I go anywhere without cobwebs anymore. I, uh, find myself keeping my \nguard up around mannequins as well, though I’ll admit that one is more likely \nto be my own projection. \nBut honestly, it’s the internal threats I’m worried about. Peter Lukas is just \nsitting up there, doing whatever the hell it is he and Elias have planned, and \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 125 – Civilian Casualties \n \n10 \n \nMelanie still has that bullet pumping violence into her, waiting to turn this \nplace into another Lanncraig. I just wish there wa— \n… \nWait. I, I didn’t— \nDid I read that somewhere, or...? \n… \nR-right. Yes. The bullet… didn’t show up on electronic or mechanical scans, but \nit’s still lodged in her leg, just above the tibia. And it’s been getting slowly \ninfected ever sin— I have to find Basira. \n[Tape clicks off. Tape clicks on. Sounds of breathing in sleep.] \nARCHIVIST \n(Hushed throughout this exchange) You’re sure about this? \nBASIRA \n(Hushed throughout this exchange) No, but if you’re right, I don’t see what \nchoice we’ve got. \nARCHIVIST \nNo, I mean... \nBASIRA \nOh, yeah, the stuff she takes is pretty strong these days. She should be out for \na while. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 125 – Civilian Casualties \n \n11 \n \nWell, sleep is hard. \nARCHIVIST \nYou’ve been staying here too? \nBASIRA \nGot a camp bed at the other end, near the tunnels. I like to keep an eye on \nthem. Besides, wanted to give her some space, you know? But yeah, living \noutside the Institute, it’s just not safe anymore. \nARCHIVIST \nWhat about Martin? \nBASIRA \nI think he’s still got a place? He’s not down here, anyway. \nARCHIVIST \nRight. So, how, how does thi— \nBASIRA \nDo you want to get on with this or what? \nARCHIVIST \nYes, right, sorry. You, uh, you managed to get some anaesthetic? \nBASIRA \nHere.
