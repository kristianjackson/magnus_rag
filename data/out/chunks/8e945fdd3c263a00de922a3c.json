He quickly got out of bed and started to get \ndressed. As he pulled on a shirt he asked me where I had found it and I told \nhim, on the kitchen table. Following me downstairs, his gaze was immediately \nlocked on the open door and he paused. Instead of going outside, he walked \nover to the kitchen sink and turned on one of the taps. Immediately there \nbegan to flow a dark, dirty-looking liquid and the sick, salty smell of brackish \nwater hit my nose, though at the time I didn’t understand that’s what it was. \nThe light in the kitchen blew out at that moment and the room got very dark. \nMy father told me everything was fine, that I should go back to bed. His hands \nshook slightly as he took the pendant from me, and I didn’t believe him but I \ndid what I was told anyway. I don’t know how long I lay there, waiting for my \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG009 – A Father’s Love \n5 \n \nfather to return that night but I know it was getting light outside when I finally \nfell asleep. \nEventually I woke up. The house was quiet and empty. I had missed the start of \nschool by hours but that was fine because I didn’t want to leave the house. I \njust sat in the living room, silent and still. It was almost evening again by the \ntime my father actually returned. His face was pale and he barely looked at \nme, just walked straight to the cupboard and poured himself a glass of scotch. \nHe sat next to me, drained the glass, and told me that my mother was gone. I \ndidn’t understand. Still don’t, really. But he said it with such finality that I \nstarted to cry and I didn’t stop for a very long time. \nMy father was a policeman, as I’m sure you’ve read, so as a child I just \nassumed that the police had looked for my mother and failed to find her. It \nwasn’t until much later that I discovered they’d had never even had a missing \npersons report filed on her. As far as I know, I never had any living \ngrandparents and apparently no-one noticed she was gone, which was strange \nas I have vague memories of her having friends over a lot before she vanished. \nEveryone assumes she was one of my father’s first victims but there was never \nenough evidence to add it to the official tally. It doesn’t really matter. \nFor what it’s worth, I don’t think he did it. I won’t deny it makes sense from the \noutside but I remember how devastated he was when she disappeared. He \nstarted drinking a lot. I think he did try to look after me as best he could but \nmost nights he just ended up passed out in his chair. That was also when he \nstarted spending a lot of time in the shed. I’d never really paid it much \nattention before. As far as I was concerned the sturdy wooden structure was \njust the home of spiders’ nests and the rusted garden tools my parents would \nuse once a year to attack the overgrown wilderness that was our back garden.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 2, "chunk_count": 10, "chars": 2869}}
