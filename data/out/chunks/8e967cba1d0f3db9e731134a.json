He \nalmost missed his father’s funeral because he was away on a scuba-diving trip \nto Cyprus, and only just managed to book a last minute flight home. It wasn’t \nhis fault, of course, Stephen’s death came as a shock to us all; what I mean to \nsay is… I wasn’t at all surprised when he told me a few years ago that he’d \ngotten very involved in skydiving. \nt had started as a charity thing. His last year at Yarmouth he decided to do a \nskydive for a charity he’d been volunteering with. I went along to support him \nwhen he did it, and when he touched down I could see it in his eyes, even \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG021 – Freefall \n3 \n \nbefore he’d removed his parachute, that he was in love. Since then, it was rare \nthat a month went by without him throwing himself out of a plane, to the \npoint where I wondered where he was getting the money, as from what I hear \nit’s not a cheap hobby, and he certainly wasn’t getting much from me. \nShortly after Robert graduated, he came to visit. He was the happiest I’d seen \nhim since his father passed away, and when I asked him about it he said he’d \ngot a job with a company that ran skydiving all over the country. They were \ncalled Open Skydiving and, his face was beaming when he said this, he was \nnow a fully qualified skydiving instructor. I was happy for him of course, even \nthough every time he described jumping it sounded quite dreadful to me. I had \nalways made it clear that he was never going to get me up there, plummeting \nthrough the sky. \nAfter that, I didn’t see him much. He was home for Christmas and Mother’s \nDay, if I was lucky, but aside from that it was the occasional phone call or even \na postcard if he was running a dive at somewhere far away. I have a small stack \nof them back home, all I really have to remember him by. I remember he sent \nme one from Aberystwyth of all places, not too far back, and he signed it “with \nlove from your free-falling son”. I used to really like that, but now the phrase \njust makes shudder. \nHe was happy, though. He was doing what he loved. I try to hold on to that. \nThere was no way for me to know that anything was wrong. I mean, nothing \nwas wrong. I’m sure of it. Not until that last time. \nHe came to see me three months ago. I was surprised, as June is the height of \nthe season and his last phone call had seemed to say that he was expecting to \nbe busy right up until winter arrived. Still, here he was, standing on the \ndoorstep and he looked to be in an awful state. He had deep bags under his \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG021 – Freefall \n4 \n \neyes and it didn’t look as though he’d washed in some time. Before he’d said \nanything I took him inside, sat him down and started to run a hot bath. \nWhatever had happened, I told him, could wait until he’d gotten himself \ntogether. I think I had the right of it, as once he had cleaned himself up and \nhad some hot food he seemed a lot more himself than he had been. Still, he \nspent a good ten minutes just sat there, staring into space. \nI asked him what the matter was, whether he’d had an accident or lost his job \nor something. When I said that, he laughed an odd sort of laugh and said that \nhe had lost his job. He’d quit, he said. I asked him why, after all he had always \nloved the whole business of skydiving, but as I said the word ‘sky’ I saw him \nflinch back like I had slapped him. So I quieted down and asked him to tell me \nwhat had happened. \nThey’d been running a dive up near Doncaster, he said. Some 85-year-old \ndoing a tandem jump for charity in memory of his wife. He hadn’t been the \none actually doing the jump with the old man, but it was a significant enough \nthing that his colleague had asked him to come up as well for support. He'd be \ncoming down alone on a solo parachute. It all started well enough, the flight up \nwas fine and the old man, who said his name was Simon, appeared to be \nhaving a great time, making jokes and quite frankly a lot more eager to throw \nhimself out of a plane than almost anyone Robert had ever met before. \nFinally the climb finished and the door was opened to the rush of air. Harriet \nFairchild, the instructor, readied herself to jump, with Simon strapped to her \nchest. It was at this moment, Robert said, that the old man turned to him, \nshouting something. He didn’t hear it clearly, but thought it had been “enjoy \nsky blue”. He’d felt dizzy all of a", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 1, "chunk_count": 5, "chars": 4499}}
