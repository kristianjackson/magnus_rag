Someone had \nseen that, she was sure of it, and what must they think of her? \n[Large plaster falling sound, followed by an unpleasant, watery, \npulsing sound] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nOn the section of wall she had kicked, a big chunk of plaster crumbled to the \nfloor, revealing the brick behind. Carmen’s brow wrinkled, first in confusion, \nthen in horror. Set into those bricks behind the plaster was an eye. It was \nlarger than a human eye, and flatter, almost the size of her head, and it pulsed \ngently. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 188 – Centre of Attention \n \n20 \nThe pupil was locked on her. And all at once Carmen understood how deep it \nwent, that they were in everything, lurking in the very fabric of the world she \nlived in, always keeping watch on her. \n[Furniture movement, followed by walking to kitchen, then knife \nsliding] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nIt was not in rage, but in cold fury that Carmen moved the desk and marched \ndown to the kitchen, ignoring her flatmate’s recriminations of her actions \nbeing unacceptable. She picked up a chef’s knife and returned to her room, \nshutting the door behind her once again. \n[Door slams; pulsing sound resumes] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nShe looked at the eye, and the eye looked back. \nCarmen’s arm shot out, thrusting the tip of the blade right into the pupil. But it \ndid not cut anything, for there was nothing but empty blackness. Carmen’s \nknife, then her hand, then her forearm passed into the void of that pupil, her \nskin bristling with the cold. \n[Ice crunching; followed by a loud wet contraction] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nAnd then the iris closed around her arm, the thin flesh of the tightening muscle \nclenching with astonishing strength as it held her in place. \n[Wet crunching after muscular constriction; Carmen starts to groan \nand cry as she struggles] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 188 – Centre of Attention \n \n21 \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nThen, inch by inch by inch, it began to pull her in. She tried to scream, but her \nflatmate simply shushed her. Her terror was pointed and crimson, and \ntomorrow she will wake up hating London, and worrying about how many \ncameras there are. \n[Hissing static starts] \n[One last grunt and watery struggling] \n(The Archivist breathes deeply) \n[Hissing static ends] \n[Whispers and camera iris movements resume] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nIs that what you wanted to hear? Why you’re all staring at me like that? You \nwanted a story? Or maybe I am your chosen one and you’re just waiting for \nyour orders. I’m special to the thing upstairs, so that makes me special to all of \nyou as well, right? \nWell, let’s see if I’m worthy of your attention. \n[A camera whirs] \n[Tape clicks off] \n[The Magnus Archives Theme – Outro] \nJONATHAN SIMS \nThe Magnus Archives is a podcast distributed by Rusty Quill and licensed under \na Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial ShareAlike 4.0 International \nlicence.
