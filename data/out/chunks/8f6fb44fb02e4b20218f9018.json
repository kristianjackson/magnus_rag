We kept them in metal mesh cages so they’re \nviewable at all times. There’s a hole in the front which is lined with gauze that \ncan be gathered up to make a seal or allow you access to the cage. Normally \nthey’re happy enough to flit about their cages. But then, without warning, they \nstopped. They landed on the cage and just stayed there. They were distributed \nalmost completely evenly over the inside, to the point where it almost looked \nregimented, and then they would stay like that for hours. It was unsettling, and \nmore than once the researchers retrieved some for testing, looking for any \nchange that might have resulted in this altered behaviour, but everything came \nback normal. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG045 – Blood Bag \n6 \n \nSometimes though, when I was working late, I’d look into that room, and I \nswear I would see a mass of mosquitoes in each cage, crowded in a thick clump \naround the gauze covering the entrance. I should have told somebody, but at \nthe time I didn’t know what I was seeing. \nThe mosquitoes’ attitudes towards the fake blood bags changed as well. \nInstead of meandering round, landing, feeding, flying off, feeding again, a few \ntimes, now as soon as the bag was placed inside, every mozzie in there would \ndescend on it immediately, all at once, until the bag was completely covered in \nneedle mouths and flitting wings. It genuinely started to scare me. \nWhat really scared me, though, and everyone else on the team, was what \ncame out of the blood bag afterwards. Shortly after they began exhibiting this \nbehaviour, one of the other research assistants, George Larson, was retrieving \none of the empty bags and returning it for disposal in the lab, when he \nstumbled, and it fell to the floor. When it hit the ground with a moist thud, it \nbecame immediately clear that the bag was not as empty as it had first \nappeared. \nThe blood substitute, the ‘haemoglobish’, was a clear, syrupy orange, almost \nlike dark honey, but slightly thinner. What oozed out of the bag now was a \ndeep, cloudy red. At this point nobody objected to calling in a biohazard. They \ntook samples of the substance, and put us through a basic decontamination, \nand then I went home. Odd to think now that my thoughts back then were full \nmore of curiosity than of fear. \nThe tests came back, and were as alarming as they were impossible. It was \nblood. Real blood. O Negative and infected with malaria. Not just malaria \nthough, but yellow fever, hepatitis B and signs of cholera. There were other \nsubstances in the sample as well, that they were unable to identify. We were \nall told that we were to be quarantined immediately, and that our project was \nshut down until further notice. I remember standing there in the lab as they \nsaid this. I heard a strangled cry from behind me, and turned around to see \nNeil, shaking his head over and over, his face a mask of rage and hatred. He \nwasn’t looking at the people who had come to quarantine us though. No, he \nwas looking at the room full of mosquitoes, as though they had planned this,", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 4, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 3064}}
