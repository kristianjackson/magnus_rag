It was the dark \ngreen exit door that should lead out of the building. I didn’t even stop to \nconsider that it might not lead outside; I just opened it and stepped through. \nMy feet didn’t land on the tarmac of the outside. They didn’t land on the \nconcrete or metal or tile of the slaughterhouse floor, either. It was dark, so I \ndidn’t immediately realise what I was treading on, except that it shifted slightly \nunder my weight. I looked to either side, and saw the metal barriers penning \nme in, and the conveyor belt beneath me began to move. I realised where I \nwas, where it would lead, and I screamed. \nTurning to run, I almost expected a horde of cattle behind me, pressing me \nonwards as the runs are designed to make them, but there was nothing there, \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG030 – Killing Floor \n8 \n \nand I fled out the door. I slammed it behind me and… and I began to cry. It was \nlike something numb within me had shattered, and I couldn’t... I just couldn’t. \nIt was as I sat there, collapsed against the wall, that I started to smell it. The \ncoppery-sweet scent of blood. It had a strange sort of comfort to it, as it was \nthe smell of the slaughterhouse as I had known it, before I found my way to \nwherever I was now. I began to follow it, just walking along, turning wherever \nthe odour of blood was strongest. And it did get stronger, much stronger. As I \nturned corners and walked through dark rooms, the smell became thick, \npungent, far more than it had ever been before. By the time I stood outside \nthe dull steel door it came from, I could barely breath. From the other side \ncame a loud, mechanical churning. I shouldn’t have opened it, but where else \nwas I going to go? \nIt led to a small catwalk, around the edge of a large, circular room. No, large \ndoesn’t do it justice. It was… immense. I could barely see the other side of it, \nfar in the distance. All around the edges were the ends of conveyor belts, and I \ncould see butchered carcasses rolling off them, feeding into the vast pit that \ntook up the rest of the room. The pile of stinking, bloody bodies, more than I \ncould count. Pigs, cattle, sheep, I think I even saw a few humans in the pile, \nthough without heads or limbs it’s hard to tell the difference between them \nand pigs. The vast heap shifted and moved, as something mechanical far below \nchewed through it, but it was always being topped up, fed by those conveyor \nbelts, carcasses falling limply on top of each other like dolls. I couldn’t see the \nbottom, though whatever was processing the pile was so loud as to almost \ndrown out my thoughts. What else could I do, but turn around once again, and \nrun? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG030 – Killing Floor \n9 \n \nI don’t have the faintest idea how long I ran for. All I know is that eventually I \nfell to my knees in the dark and I lay there for a while. The sound and smell of \nthe pit had faded away, and I began to hear another sound, the chunking thud \nof a bolt gun. At this point I was just about sick of following strange noises and \nsmells around that goddamn place, so I turned around and started walking the \nother way. It didn’t help. Whichever way I went, the sound just seemed to get \nlouder, echoing through the empty hallways. \nWhen I opened the door back onto the killing floor, I just didn’t have any \nsurprise left inside of me. Sitting there, in front of the stunning box, was Tom \nHaan. He was facing away from me, but I could see him, slowly and \ndeliberately, placing the bolt gun against different parts of himself – his legs, \nhis stomach, his shoulders – and pulling the trigger. By the time I reached him, \nhe was little more than a mass of bleeding wounds. He mutely handed me the \nbolt gun and I took it. With his one working hand, he guided my arm until the \ngun rested against the centre of his forehead. But he didn’t make me fire it. I \ndid that myself. He fell limp to the floor. I don’t know if he was dead, but I \nhope so. I’d hate it if that place had to bleed him. \nThe door behind him led to a corridor I recognised, and the next door I found \nmarked ‘Exit’ opened to a sunny day so bright that I could barely see. There \nwere people there, other workers, but no-one paid me any attention. I left the \nslaughterhouse, and didn’t go back. I kept expecting the police to call me about \nTom, but I never heard his name mentioned again. Not even when I handed in \nmy resignation. I wish I felt bad about his death, but I don’t.
