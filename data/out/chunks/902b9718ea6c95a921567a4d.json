No-one will even know. And it will hurt. Oh, yes, it will hurt. It \nhurt Sasha. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG079 – Hide and Seek \n15 \n \nARCHIVIST \nShut up! \nNOT!SASHA \n(Closer) There you are. \n[The Archivist runs. The tape clicks off. The tape clicks on. The following \nconversation is distorted by Michael’s corridors.] \nTIM \nWhere the hell are we? \nMARTIN \nI don’t know. I thought… I thought the door led further down. \nTIM \nI don’t think we’re under the Institute anymore. \nMARTIN \nWhat was that thing? \nTIM \nI’m trying not to think about it. It makes my head feel weird. \nMARTIN \nWell? Wh… which way do you think? \nTIM \nEr… Right. Let’s go right. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG079 – Hide and Seek \n16 \n \nMARTIN \n(Sigh) Fine. I don’t think this thing’s working properly. It k-keeps making this \nweird noise. \n[Tape clicks off. Tape clicks on.] \nNOT!SASHA \nI’m glad we got a chance to run, John. It makes it so much more satisfying. Do \nyou have any idea how long I watched you? You and your little… acolytes. I \nhated it. \nLet me tell you a story. You like stories; we can even call it a statement if you \nwant. \nOnce upon a time there was a monster, but no one realised. Sometimes \nsomeone did and then they were scared, so that was good. But one day a nasty \nman came along. A nasty man who tricked the monster and wrapped it all in \nwebs and tied it to a table. \nSo the monster got its friends to carry the table all around, and it still got to \ntake faces and scare people. Then one day it was sent to the house of its \nenemy, which had the biggest eyes you ever did see. The monster was sent \nthere to steal all its secrets, but it was sad because it couldn’t scare anyone any \nmore. \nThen finally, after what seemed like forever, a stupid, arrogant, little man cut \nthe webs and set the monster free. Free to kill and scare whoever it wanted. \nSo thank you. I did leave what clues I could but I never dared hope you would \nactually release me. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG079 – Hide and Seek \n17 \n \n(Laughs) \nI must confess, though, I almost enjoyed watching you scurry around. \nDesperately missing the point. At least I knew what I was looking for. You really \naren’t even a shadow of your predecessor. You’re nothing. Even I would make \na better Archivist than you. \nMaybe I will. \nYou’ll miss the Unknowing, of course, but you wouldn’t understand it anyway. \nARCHIVIST \n(Whispered) I’m sorry. Martin, Tim… Sasha. I’m so sorry. I should have… I \ndidn’t… I’m sorry. \nGod, I’m so sorry. \nNOT!SASHA \nI wonder, if I wear you, will I really become the Archivist? Rob the eye of its \npupil? \nProbably not. Better to just kill you I think. \nYes. I think that would be best. \nARCHIVIST \n(Whispered) Please forgive me. If you’re still alive… if… if you hear this. Get as \nfar away from the Magnus Institute – \nNOT!SASHA \n \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG079 – Hide and Seek \n18 \n \nFound you. \nARCHIVIST \nNo. Please… \nNOT!SASHA \nSorry, John, but this is – \n[The walls of the tunnel shifts with scraping stone. Not!Sasha screams. \nThere’s silence.] \nARCHIVIST \nWhat? \nUNKNOWN \nMr. Sims? \nARCHIVIST \nYes. \nUNKNOWN \nI think it’s time we had a talk. \n[Tape clicks off.] \n[The Magnus Archives Theme – Outro] \nThe Magnus Archives is a podcast distributed by Rusty Quill and licensed under \na Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Sharealike 4.0 International \nlicence.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 3, "chunk_count": 5, "chars": 3408}}
