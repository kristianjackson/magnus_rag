The Magnus Archives. Episode one hundred and fifty-six: \n\"Reflection.\" \n[Tape clicks on. Paper rustles. A clock ticks.] \nMARTIN \nMm? (beat) Oh. \n(He laughs, softly.) \nMARTIN (CONT’D) \nYeah. (Rustling paper) I was going to read one. Hate for you to miss it! \n(He laughs again) \n[The paper rustles.] \nMARTIN (CONT’D) \nYou know, I- I’ve been wondering about your batteries. Like, could I just take \nthe batteries out each time one of you appears, and just- have an infinite \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 156 – Reflection \nsupply of batteries? I mean- I won’t; don’t worry, don’t really have anything \nthat needs them these days. \nAlso, I know there’s every chance that you don’t even have any, and it’s just \nempty, and, well... I’m not really sure that’s something I want to confirm. \nOr, I open up your compartment and it’s like- meat, or maggots, or something. \n(Pause.) Mm. Emptiness or maggots. (He exhales) It’s kinda the shape of things \naround here, isn’t it? Still, kind of nice to talk to some... thing? (He sighs.) It’s \nalways quiet, these days. For me, at least. \nI guess I technically have the power to make it not quiet, to, to talk to people, \nbut like- you know, I, I also have the power to clean out the fridge, and it’s still \na mess. It’s not that I don’t want to clean the fridge, it’s just- \nSome things are just hard. \nAnyway. I know he’s been listening to the tapes, so I guess that’ll have to do. \nI think I still care that he hears my voice. It’s hard to tell, sometimes. How \nmuch do I actually care, and how much is just feeling that I should care? I’m on \nmy own so much these days, I... \nJust wish I didn’t like it so much. \nI mean, if you’ve got any thoughts, I’d love to hear them. \n(Pause.) \nMARTIN (CONT’D) \nHmm? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 156 – Reflection \n[Silence, but for the clock.] \nMARTIN (CONT’D) \nNo. Didn’t think so. (Long inhale) That’s not what you’re here for, is it? (Sigh) \nNo. You want this. \nMARTIN (CONT’D) \nFine. (Heavy sigh) Fine. Have it your way. As usual. (pause) \nMartin Blackwood, assistant to Peter Lukas, Head of the Magnus Institute, \nrecording statement #0090401. Statement of Adelard Dekker, taken from a \nletter to Gertrude Robinson, dated 4th of January, 2009. \nStatement begins. \nMARTIN (STATEMENT) \n(Inhale) Gertrude. I wanted your opinion on an encounter I’ve had described to \nme, and given your recent dealing with Viscera, I would very much value your \ninput. \nGood job on that, by the way. I’m sure the gnostic temple was a great loss \nculturally speaking, but I can’t help but admire your directness when it comes \nto this sort of thing. I often find myself locked in a sense of esoteric paralysis \non how to proceed. \nStill. God grant me clarity to act when I need it. \nAnyway, I was following up on a young man who had apparently had a nasty \nexperience whilst exploring the ruins of the Bright Lake amusement park in \nColorado.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 0, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 3105}}
