About the figure of the merchant, the trader who deals in strange and \ndangerous goods, how it can be found in so many myths and fables, dealing in \nsecond-hand nightmares. And how rarely the merchant themself is ever \npunished in those stories. \nI would love to pretend that it was out of self-preservation that I committed to \nmy new trade, but that would be mostly a lie. To tell you the truth, I got a real \nkick out of playing my role. To think of myself as a purveyor of curses, walking \nsoftly through the most dangerous edges of reality so that the rich and \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 181 – Ignorance \n18 \narrogant could buy their own doom. Sometimes people would come to me for \nsolutions, protections or talismans to ward off the attention they had already \ncalled down on themselves. I sometimes did what I could to help, but I had to \nbe careful. I could never afford to forget who I actually was working for. And \ndo you know what? I managed to walk that tightrope for decades without \nfalling. You know, I think there were times when I was perhaps skirting close to \nThe Stranger, but I kept my name prominent and, well… (chuckles) I’m not \nexactly a small personality. Anonymity just wouldn’t have suited me. \nBut the years, they wear on you, and as I talked to more and more people \nversed in that secret world, more acolytes and would-be cultists about rituals \nand destinies, I began to come to a conclusion. As the number of people in the \nworld grew, and the amount of fear grew with it, I began to become convinced \nthat it was only a matter of time before one of them succeeded. Before the \nworld was transformed into... Well, you’d know better than me. \nSo I began to plan for my... retirement. I spent most of my fortune preparing. \nSome on supplies, but mostly hunting down an artifact that I hoped might give \nme some… protection. One I had sold right at the start of my career: an old \nbroken camera. One that through some quirk had the ability to hide you from \nthe Powers. It was in the possession of another scared old man, one who had \nlong been running from his own supernatural debts. I believe it operates as a \nsort of, er, battery, charging itself on all the quiet worries that come from living \nin hiding, and then when the sanctuary collapses, all that fear flows out at \nonce. No doubt if my oasis breaks before I die, The Eye will get quite the feast \nfrom me, but in this new world I would hope it has other things to keep itself \nbusy. Anyway, it took a lot of resources to find it again, and even more to \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 181 – Ignorance \n19 \nretrieve it. Staging my death was a comparative, erm, afterthought, in some \nways just, just a happy accident. \nAnd so I waited, and lived out my days in comfort. For the longest time I \nthought that, well, maybe I had simply entered normal retirement really \ndramatically. But then… well... I was right. I. Was. Right. Both about the world \nand about the camera — it hid me from The Eye which, in the new order of \nreality, also protects where I am from the hellscape all around us. And when I \nrealised that the power moves with the camera — well, hmph, let’s just say I \nloaded up a truckload of supplies, and went on some journeys of my own, \nbefore I found this place. \n[Mikaela adds more ice to his glass] \nNo reason to not live the Apocalypse in style. \n[He takes a sip of drink] \nIn the end I find myself quite happy. I have supplies for a good few years, and \nthen I plan to take my own life. I think perhaps that’s the greatest blessing the \ncamera can bestow. I. Can. Die. Here. Escape this place. Not yet, of course, and \nmaybe the wine will do me in before I have to take matters into my own \nhands, but still, it remains a comfort. \nAnyway, no more stories, I think. Let us relax, and talk and drink. And not \nworry about who might be… listening. \n[Tape clicks off] \n[Tape clicks on] \n[Bag-packing noises inside an otherwise quiet room]", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 4, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 4082}}
