I shook my head and turned to leave, but as I did so, I \nsaw a small flash of colour in the bath. I pulled back the white curtain and \nlooked down. Surrounding the edges of the plug’s pristine chrome was a small \nhalo of purple. I leaned over to get a closer look. It appeared to be some sort of \nfungus, scrubbed away so only the faintest traces remained. There was a \nspongy, fibrous look to it, and I had the sudden image of long, soft tendrils \nstretching away down through the pipes. It was the colour of a fresh bruise \nand smelled sour, like old milk. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG093 – Contaminant \n6 \n \nI don’t know how long I stood staring at it, but when I looked up, my father-in-\nlaw stood in the bathroom door with a look on his face that was a mixture of \nanger and embarrassment. He started screaming at me about privacy and \nrespect, about how he was a clean man, and knew how to keep his house pure. \nHe had a lump of wire wool in his hands, and I left quickly, because…. I was \nsomehow sure that if I didn’t he was going to start scrubbing me with it. \nI didn’t go back the next day, both to let him cool off, and because I need to \nspend some time convincing myself that I shouldn’t just head home and leave \nhim to whatever the hell he thought was going on. I couldn’t get that mould \nout of my head, though. When I went out to eat, I kept thinking I could smell \nthat awful, sour odour, and I ended up just sitting there, watching my burger \nas it cooled down, searching its surface for any signs of… something. At one \npoint a fly landed on it, and I just found myself nodding, like everything was \nexactly as it should be. I don’t know. I wasn’t sleeping well; my sheets felt odd. \nSlimy, somehow, though whenever I turned the lights on to look… there was \nnothing out of the ordinary. \nI did go back. Of course I did. He wasn’t well. I know I should have done \nsomething, forced some help on him somehow, but even now I’m not sure \nhow I could have done it. Greg didn’t answer the door, but it wasn’t locked. \nThe house was still spotless, but the cleanliness didn’t look quite as fresh as it \nhad before. Like it had been cleaned earlier, and just hadn’t been used since \nthen. My father-in-law was sat on the sofa in the same clothes he’d had on the \nlast time I’d seen him. His skin was slick with sweat, and his face was blank. I \ncalled out to him and he looked up, but there was… no recognition in his eyes. \nI glanced behind him, and saw the bathroom door was closed. Not just closed, \nbut sealed. All the edges and the cracks had been packed through with sealant.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 2, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 2735}}
