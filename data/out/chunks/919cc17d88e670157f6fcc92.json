He was \nplaying the closest thing the film had to a protagonist: a homeless ex-\nMethodist minister who’d found himself on the island by chance and served as \na connecting thread, wandering between the scenes and the vignettes of the \ninhabitants after each ended with their march to the spider. \n \nBrandon took to the role immediately, with a gravity and a weariness that I \ndon’t think could have been entirely feigned. He was the only one who didn’t \nseem excited by the movie, and spent his off hours smoking and reading \nquietly in one of the trailers. It was a shame because for whatever reason he \nalso seemed to be the only one that Dexter would listen to. I only saw them \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG110 – Creature Feature \n \n9 \n \ntalking once or twice, but every time Dexter would be rapt, nodding at \nwhatever Brandon might have to say. \n \nOf course, I never really had time to think on it. I was finding it an almost \nimpossible task to get even the most basic of shots, with Dexter constantly \ndemanding the whole set-up be changed for no reason. Like I said, I’m \nexcellent at my job, but giving him what he wanted from the camerawork \nrelied on him actually knowing it himself. There was a frenzied, nervous energy \nto his instructions and, if I didn’t know any better, I might have even said that \nhe wasn’t just afraid the shots might not work, he was afraid of the idea. \n \nAnd so it was for the first few weeks. Dexter clearly wasn’t sleeping. He had \ninsisted on using old equipment and avoided digital almost entirely, to the \npoint where several of the crew were using pieces of kit they’d never even \nseen before. This meant that a workprint had to be made manually for the \ndailies, something he refused to let anyone else do. Once shooting wrapped \nhe’d be in the editing room for hours “preparing dailies”, although they \nshouldn’t have needed editing at all. And when we watched them, I’d often \nnotice that certain shots were missing, stuff I was certain that we’d filmed. I \nbrought this up with him once, and he called me a liar to my face. \n \nI only interrupted him when he was preparing dailies once. An actress who was \nslated to be shooting the next day had taken violently ill and the crew needed \nhis sign-off to change the schedule. No-one else dared to go in, so once again it \nwas down to me to head into that tiny room alone. \n \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG110 – Creature Feature \n \n10 \n \nIt was dark inside, lit only by what spilled in through the open doorway. I could \nhear a sound like the turning of an old film reel, but I couldn’t say where from. \nI stood there, unable to step inside, not because of fear, but because the space \ninside was threaded all over with film strips. Up and down, one side to the \nother, wrapping around and through each other. I gingerly reached out and \ntouched one and, as I did, Dexter seemed to emerge from the darkness. At \nfirst, I thought he was taller than usual, but then I realised that he was \nsuspended, ever so slightly, by the strips of film, his feet a good couple of \ninches off the floor. He was very calm as he asked what I wanted, and when I \nstutteringly explained the situation, he just nodded and said we should feel \nfree to rearrange however we liked. Then he closed the door and I left, trying \nvery hard to convince myself that he had only had two arms. \n \nShooting continued, but there was a growing awareness throughout the crew \nthat we had still seen nothing from Neil Lagorio. Nobody had met him on set or \nspotted him or his team entering or leaving the workshop where the spider \nwas supposedly being constructed. No-one had heard the sound of work being \ndone in there, and the rumour was that Dexter had finally lost it and the \nworkshop was empty. We had run through all the scenes that could be done \nwithout it, and everyone was getting really impatient. \n \nFinally, Dexter announced it was time for the unveiling, for the spider, for \nKumo to make its appearance. We were all excited as we assembled outside \nthe workshop, but there was a nervous energy in the air that day. It was about \nas cold as it ever gets in LA, but the shiver that passed through us when he told \nus it was time was something else entirely.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 4, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 4244}}
