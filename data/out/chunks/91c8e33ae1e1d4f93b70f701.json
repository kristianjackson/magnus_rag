But it is \nimportant to this account, as I believe it was whatever heroin still remained in \nmy system that night that caused the vampire Robert Arden to remove its \ntongue from my neck and start to shake, as though having a violent choking fit. \nI lay there, trying to compose myself enough to fight back, when I became \naware of the screaming. The woman, who had been brought in as a victim, was \nstanding over the flailing Robert Arden, stabbing it repeatedly with a kitchen \nknife. Strong and quick as it was, the vampire didn’t seem to be able to cope \nwith the sudden onslaught of violence and was on the ground. This gave me \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG010 – Vampire Killer \n12 \n \nthe precious seconds I needed to get to my feet and locate my improvised \nwooden stake. I took aim and plunged it into where I believed the thing’s heart \nshould be. It was easier than I thought it would be – the chest was soft and \nyielding and there didn’t seem to be any ribcage to stop the blow. Robert \nArden went rigid and froze, apparently unable to move its body, though I saw \nits eyes darting around wildly. \nIt was at that point the woman whose name I never discovered, dropped the \nknife and ran. I never saw her again, but she had already saved my life. I took \nout my cigarette lighter and set Robert Arden alight. Like Sylvia McDonald \nbefore it, it caught fire in a matter of seconds and, by the time the police \narrived, there was nothing left but a small patch of scorched tarmac. I was \nlucky that night, and nobody saw anything or called the police before I was \nfinished and had made my way from the scene but I was always more careful \nafter that. \nFollowing that night, though, I was never again worried that I might have been \nwrong about the existence of vampires. I always kept my eyes open for them, \nalthough sometimes I was too eager, as was the case of Alard Dupont who I \nkilled in 1982 and later discovered was a human. It is my belief that they are \nvery rare and feed only infrequently, as all evidence I have seen points to their \nfeeding being fatal. If there were many vampires or if they ate often, the \nnumber of disappearances would quickly become noticeable to the rest of \nsociety. I do not know what they do with the bodies of their victims and this \nhas always perplexed me, as they do not have any mechanism for eating solid \nfood and I do not believe there are many, if any, cases of murder where the \nbody is found completely without blood. I certainly do not think they rise as \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG010 – Vampire Killer \n13 \n \nvampires themselves, as the vampire population seems far too small for this to \nbe a possibility. \nJONATHAN SIMS \nStatement ends. \nAccording to Martin, who was here when they took this statement, it was at \nthis point in writing that Mr. Herbert announced he needed some sleep before \ncontinuing. He was shown to the break room where he went to sleep on the \ncouch. He did not awaken; unfortunately succumbing to the lung cancer right \nthere. Martin says the staff had been aware of how serious Mr. Herbert’s \ncondition was and had advised him to seek medical aid prior to giving his \nstatement, but were told rather bluntly by the old man that he would not wait \nanother second to state his case. I can’t decide whether this lends more or less \ncredibility to his tale. \nRegardless, there is substantial evidence to support the version of events told \nby Mr. Herbert in all aspects except the vampirism. There is a news report of a \n1959 fire that consumed a house on Loom Street and apparently claimed the \nlife of an 18-year-old boy, although no mention is made of the homeowner, \nand a police report from 1968 confirms the disappearance of Robert Arden in \nManchester amid circumstances of violence, including a broken window and \nsigns of a fire, though no human remains were found. There is also a murder \nreport concerning one Alard Dupont, whose partially burned corpse was found \nin his home on August 2nd 1982. Unfortunately Mr. Herbert was never able to \ngive details of others, so we cannot corroborate further. \nThere was, however, a small bag left on top of this statement, which appears \nto contain six shark teeth of varying sizes.
