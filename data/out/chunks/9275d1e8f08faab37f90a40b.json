Original statement given 19th October \n2013.

I’ve had jobs in a \ncouple over the last few years, and talked to people who’ve worked in others, \nand they all seem to operate slightly differently. \nSome treat every department almost as a separate business, with its own \ndedicated team, some move their workforce around regularly, so they don’t \nget too comfortable. A few operate almost entirely by leasing out spaces to \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG083 – Drawing a Blank \n5 \n \nspecific companies, like the individual perfume or makeup counters, so you \nhave an array of small, isolated teams on their little island of product. \nI personally prefer the second sort, as it gives me an opportunity to work with \na lot of different people and products, and I have a tendency to get… bored if \neverything gets too samey for too long. \nSo Fanton’s worked pretty well for me, at least at first. I mean, it’s not like \ncustomer service is my passion; the public is a moaning, dreadful bunch, but it \nwas only a part-time job to put me through art school, and my colleagues were \nmostly a decent lot. \nWhat I did enjoy, and what I tried to be involved in every time it came up, were \nthe displays. I was mainly studying illustration, but I’d always had an interest in \ndesign more generally, so when the seasons turned and we changed up the \ndisplays in the windows and on the shop floor, I always made a point to try and \nbe on the team helping to set them up. My line manager, Lana, knew this and \ngenerally let me do so. \nI’m not sure I actually sped things up, to be honest. I’m a bit of a perfectionist, \nand between posing and dressing the mannequins and setting up the props, I \nthink I probably delayed the whole process more than a bit, but everyone was \nvery patient with me as I directed them on how I thought they should \nassemble the bits I couldn’t easily reach. \nI sometimes wonder whether, if I’d left this display alone, or even let Lana do \nit, things might have turned out differently, but in the end it is what it is, and \nI’m just going to have to live with it. \nThis was about a month ago, just as we were starting to put out the autumn \ndisplays. These are always my favourites because, aside from the obvious \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG083 – Drawing a Blank \n6 \n \nduffle coats and Hallowe’en stuff, the slightly more… unexpected or avant-\ngarde displays tended to be up over the autumn. \nThe theme for this particular one was ‘Nights at the Circus’. There were \nacrobat mannequins in hoops, a rather well-made paper maché lion and the \ncentrepiece: a mannequin set up like a ringmistress, dressed in some of the \nmore theatrical clothes that Fanton’s was selling that season. \nTopped with a bright red top hat and clutching a whip, it created rather a \nstriking effect; I spent longer than I should have trying to get it absolutely \nperfect. When it was done, though, I knew it had been worth it. The shiny \nblank face stared out from below the vivid red, and the hand clutched the whip \nat such an angle it seemed as though the smooth plastic flesh might leap to life \nany second with a crack. \nThere was one other reason I quite enjoyed working at Fanton’s, and that was \nit gave me ample opportunity to practise my figure drawing. Because of my \nclasses I tended to end up working the later shifts, and Lana would usually let \nme stay past closing time, where I would spend hours drawing and redrawing \neach static figure – the different poses and costumes and displays gave me \nfantastic practise. It was almost meditative. I’ll always be grateful to Lana for \nletting my do that – a lot of the higher-ups were kind of arseholes about it, \nhiding behind faux-concern that “my condition made closing up on my own \npotentially dangerous”, but Lana, to her credit, ignored them and we never \nhad an issue. Well, not that sort of issue, at least. \nSo obviously, once the ‘Nights at the Circus’ display went up, I spent several \nevenings drawing and redrawing it, copying every curve of the almost \nfeatureless face, the line of the limbs, the poise of the feet, over and over until", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 1, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 4374}}
