Recording taken \ndirect from subject. \n \nI wanted to get some thoughts down before... everything. We all should, \nactually; I’ll mention it to them. It looks like it’s decided. Myself, Daisy, Basira \nand, uh, Tim are all going to be heading off to this ‘House of Wax’. We’re to \nsneak in as best we can; Daisy will set the charges while we, what was the \nphrase she used, “run interference”. Then we set them off once the ritual \nbegins. Gertrude’s notes were pretty clear: unless the ritual is underway, any \ndamage we do can be easily repaired. But if we time it right, it’ll be... centuries, \nmaybe, before they can try again. Of course, if we time it wrong … \n \nDaisy’s been pretty clear that she thinks the best chance of success would be \nfor her to go in alone and, honestly, I struggle to disagree. But Tim isn’t going \nto sit home and wait, and Elias seems pretty insistent I go along. Part of me \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG117 – Testament \n \n2 \n \nthinks it’s just so he can see if whatever this “preparation” he’s been trying to \ndo on me works. And you know what? That same petty little part of me rather \nhopes it doesn’t. That all this time all his cryptic nudges and learn-to-fly-by-\nfalling attitude ends up being a complete waste of time. Just to show him. Even \nso, I, I— It wouldn’t feel right not going. I think Basira is the same. She’s \ncoming along to back up Daisy, or so she says. I don’t quite get those two. I \nsuppose what they’ve done, seeing what they’ve seen... It’s a hell of a bond. \nThe sort of thing I’ve mostly done alone. Hm. Still, it does sometimes make it \nhard to fully trust them. \n \nNo. You know what? No. I’m done with that. No more paranoia. It’s almost got \nme killed more than once and Georgie was right. If I am, uh, slipping, then I \nneed people I can trust. And I don’t think that can happen naturally for me \nanymore, so I’m making a decision. I trust them. All of them. Except Elias, \nobviously, that’s not... I mean, I’ve listened to the tapes. I’ve listened to the \ntapes – I know what they talk about behind my back. How much they’ve... \nsuffered, because of this place. Because of me. God, poor Melanie... And aside \nfrom some, uh, office gossip, which, I’m not sure is... necessary, uh, or \nconducive to a workplace that... hm. It’s natural. It’s normal. There’s no... \nsinister hidden motives, or... It’s fine. It’s fine. \n \nSo, I guess... Sometime in the next few days, I go on a commando mission to \nblow up a wax museum. It’s not exactly what I was expecting from an archiving \njob. I do worry about Martin and Melanie, leaving them behind, but I suppose \nthat’s part of trusting someone, isn’t it?
