Yellow reeds and white bones. I hear it said so \noften now it almost has the rhythm of a joke. How can one have poetic clichés \nfor a massacre? How can unspeakable carnage become so tired and repetitive? \nEven the most trite and poorly written of the penny bloods would, at least, \nmake some show of a plot, or a purpose to the horror and the suffering. But \nhere, beyond those pages, it seems the dead simply pile higher and higher on \nboth sides, and nothing changes but the number of ghosts. On one side \natrocities in the name of one who claims to be brother of Christ; on the other, \nslaughter in the name of the supposedly sane men who would stop him and his \n\nHeavenly Kingdom. And I find myself walking through the still and bloody \nlandscape that has consumed all of China, scrawling my confessions on any \npaper I can find not yet saturated by mud and death. I am a stranger here, yet \nif you told me I were dead, and this place my just reward, I would not for one \nsecond doubt your honesty. I have seen no vision of hell that can compare. \nNeither could I say I have not earned it. Not for nothing do these drowned and \nmurdered faces pursue me. Nemesis was my ship, under Captain William Hall. I \nwas so eager to serve my country, how could I question what they asked us to \ndo? The trade in opium was a cornerstone of the Empire, and when called \nupon to defend it against those Chinese that would threaten Britain’s rule of \nthe waves, what could I do but answer? Was ever a man so eager to have his \ncountry beseech of him his violence? \nAnd there was violence aplenty aboard Nemesis. \nFirst of its kind. An iron warship. Small, lightly armed, but able to go where \nother British vessels never dared, far upriver to strike at the very heart of the \nQing forces, where their defences were weakest, and the damage we could \ninflict most brutal. Captain Hall had a particular zeal for the work. He was a \npetty man, bitter, and never missing an opportunity to mention how long he \nhad waited to command a ship of his own. Were I to judge solely based on the \norders he gave, I would have been forced to conclude it was the Chinese who \nhad slighted him, and now he exacted his vengeance. Truth be told, I simply \nbelieve he was possessed of a great cruelty. A cruelty I shared. \nI remember we sank a Qing ship off First Bar Island. Cambridge it was named, \nan old East Indiaman sold to the Chinese some years before. When she sank, a \nfew crew made it aboard Nemesis, half-dead and utterly defeated. I cannot \n\nhonestly recall whether Captain Hall ordered them drowned or whether I took \nit upon myself, confident in the Captain’s approval. Either way, it was certainly \nforthcoming. Theirs were the first faces that began to follow me. I would never \nhave admitted that was why I paled when I passed by a \nlooking-glass. Or why I shook my bunkmates awake, demanding that they stop \nsinging. Truth be told, no one knows how Nemesis sank. I certainly have my \nown beliefs, my own dreams of what may have reached up towards us and \ntaken its price, dragging that dreadful iron curse to the bottom of the Canton \nRiver. All I remember is waking up to the screaming of buckling metal, the \nlouder screaming of doomed men in the decks below, and that third, deeper \nset of screams, that sounded for all the world like a cry of triumph. I managed \nto get to the deck, and leap from the bow into the waters of the river. When I \nplunged below the surface and watched the hulk of Nemesis twisted and \ndisappearing into the deep, deeper than the Canton River should have been, I \nsaw the water around me full of corpses, but when I finally broke the surface, I \nwas alone. \nThese corpses follow me still, though I am hardpressed to see them now, \nsurrounded as I am by death in all its myriad forms. If you ever wish to escape \nyour pursuing guilt, there are few places so apt to hide it as a land devastated \nby unimaginable war. At least I shall not go hungry. I lost that particular moral \nqualm in Anqing. I believe thirty-eight fen was the going price for a pound of \nhuman meat by the end of the siege. Such a profound will to survive. In the \nend, it did no good. Zeng Guofan’s army breached the gates, and they put \neveryone inside to death. Sixteen thousand more corpses, soldier and civilian \nalike.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 1, "chunk_count": 5, "chars": 4348}}
