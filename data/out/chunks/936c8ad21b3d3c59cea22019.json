The kid laughed, as \nthough he and Rachel were in on some private joke. “Can you smell it?” he \nsaid, and for a brief moment, I could smell something. Damp old stone and \nmusty paper, just a faint whiff. It took me off guard, and I think that was why I \njust stood there as he walked past me and picked up the hammer. He strode \nover to one of the walls and, with a swing stronger than I would have thought \npossible from his age and skinny frame, he buried it into the wall. I heard a \nscream, high-pitched, but it definitely didn’t come from any of us. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG035 – Old Passages \n6 \n \nThis was enough to break me out of my stupor and I ran over and wrestled the \nhammer from the kid. He struggled and flailed, though he didn’t say anything. \nAs I tried to calm him down, Rachel called over me, and I looked at where he’d \nhit the wall. In the centre of it was a neat hole; the other side was darkness. \nThere shouldn’t have been anything behind the wall except foundation, but it \ndidn’t look like this was a real basement wall. I let the kid go and walked over \nto get a closer look. Rachel started to examine it with her tools, before she \nconfirmed what I’d already guessed – that it was a fake. It looked like someone \nhad blocked off a passage, and then very carefully disguised it. \nIt was at this point Alf returned, and we had some considerable explaining to \ndo. Through it all the kid, who said his name was Gerard, just sat their sullenly, \nlistening to his CD player and waiting. When we asked him how he knew what \nwas behind that wall he just shrugged, and told us that his mother knows all \nabout this stuff. He didn’t elaborate as to what “this stuff” might have been. \nWe should have waited until morning and told the Reform Club staff what \nwe’d found. We should have handed Gerard over to the police, but Alf was \nalways too curious for his own good, and he suggested we have a look inside. \nRachel and I half-heartedly tried to argue against it, but I think deep down we \nwanted to know just as much as he did. So in we went. \nKnocking through the rest of the wall didn’t take long. It had been built to look \nlike the rest of the basement, but hadn’t been constructed with the same skill. \nTen minutes later our coffees lay forgotten on the floor and we stood before a \npassageway leading off into the musty darkness. A gentle breeze blew from \nthis entrance, which didn’t make any sense at all. We had plenty of torches, as \nyou often need them during night work, so we each took one large one and a \nsmaller back-up in case the first had any problems.
