Like my shoes. I’m \nnot a particularly fashion-conscious man at the best of times, so I have three \npairs of shoes. Comfortable loafers for everyday use, a pair of walking boots \nfor hiking, and some well-shined, polished, leather brogues for fancier events. \nWell, I had a rather upmarket auction that I needed to attend, so I went to put \non my nice shoes, but they were nowhere to be found. Not the shoes, not the \nbox I kept them in. Instead there was bag containing two shirts that I know for \na fact I threw away the year before. When I asked my husband, David, about it, \nhe told me point blank that I had never had any such shoes. Claimed I always \nwore my loafers when I went to auctions or parties. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG038 – Lost and Found \n5 \n \nI know that compared to some of the ghost stories you must hear in this place, \na pair of misplaced shoes seems perfectly trivial, but something felt so... wrong \nabout the whole situation. In the end I did go in my loafers. I don’t remember if \nanyone at the auction noticed. It was about a week later that I got the invoice \nfrom Salesa. It was a pleasant surprise, far less than I thought we’d agreed on. \nThat feeling lasted until I looked through the itemised list and realised why the \ncost was so low. He hadn’t charged me for the Ming. I’ll admit that I was \nsomewhat conflicted over whether to raise the issue, but in the end I decided \nthat even if Mikaele Salesa did work with thieves, I was not going to be \ncounted among them. So I phoned him to try and explain the mistake. \nHe seemed to be in a fine mood when he answered the phone, and asked me if \nI’d had a chance to try out the sabres yet, which I’m pretty sure was a joke. I \ntold him that there was an item he’d missed off the invoice, and he said that \nno, everything had been double-checked and was correct. I was getting \nsuspicious at this point, and thought he might be trying to pull a fast one of \nsome sort with me, maybe get me to take the blame for some illicit scheme \ngone wrong. I told him so in no uncertain terms, and described our encounter \nand the vase in minute detail. He was quiet for a few seconds, and then asked \nme if I could send him a photo of the pot. His tone was different, and he \nsounded oddly wary when he made the request. I was very on edge by this \npoint, but could come up with no good reason not to agree, so I took a few \npictures with my phone and sent them through to him. \nIt was a long time before he spoke again, and when he did he sounded... \ndifferent. Almost scared, I thought. He told me that I could keep it. No charge. I \nbegan to protest again, but he ignored it. I remember his exact words: “I do \nnot remember having that thing, which means it belongs to you.” Then he", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 2, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 2776}}
