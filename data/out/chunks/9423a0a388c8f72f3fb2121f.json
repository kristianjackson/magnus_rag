The knife’s just there. Let them go. \nMARTIN \n(Tearful) I’m not going to kill you! \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 200 – Last Words \n23 \nARCHIVIST \nCut the tether. Send them away. \nMaybe we both die. Probably. But maybe not. (Emotional) Maybe, maybe \neverything works out, and we end up somewhere else. \nMARTIN \nTogether? \nARCHIVIST \n(Emotional) One way or another. Together. \n(Martin takes sobbing breaths) \n[A metallic clink as Martin picks up the knife] \nMARTIN \nI don’t think I can... \nARCHIVIST \nIt has to be you. The Eye won’t let me do it. \nMARTIN \n(Sobbing) Are you sure about this? \nARCHIVIST \n(Humourless laugh) \nNo. \nBut I love you. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 200 – Last Words \n24 \nMARTIN \nI love you too. \n[Kiss] \n[Martin stabs deeply] \n(The Archivist gasps in pain) \n(A tearful sob from Martin) \n[The building still afire; statics start; and then the sound of many \ntapes rapidly unspooling and rewinding into a rising crescendo that \nculminates in an enormous white-noise glitch created by them] \n[Tape clicks off] \n \n[Tape clicks on] \n[Sound of shifting rubble and debris; birdsong can be heard faintly] \nBASIRA \nHuh. \n[Rubble and mic noises as Basira reaches in and grabs the tape \nrecorder] \n[The birds get louder, while sounds of construction machinery are \nin background] \n(Close) Still works. \nGEORGIE \n(Calling) You found something? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 200 – Last Words \n25 \nBASIRA \nJust one of the old tape recorders. \n[Footsteps as Georgie gets closer] \nGEORGIE \nGod, tough little bastards, aren’t they? \nBASIRA \nYup. \n[Footsteps on rubble as Basira and Georgie walk to Melanie] \nMELANIE \n(Calling) No luck? \nGEORGIE \nNo, still no sign of them. \nBASIRA \nNo bodies, though. That’s a good sign, maybe? \n[Basira and Georgie reach Melanie] \nGEORGIE \nMaybe. \nMELANIE \nHuh. \n(Beat) \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 200 – Last Words \n26 \nMaybe it’s time to accept that they’re gone. \nBASIRA \nHm. \nMELANIE \nAnd, honestly, it’s probably for the best. \nI mean, I just don’t think people would exactly be understanding. You \nremember what happened when they found Simon Fairchild? \nGEORGIE \nYeah... \nMELANIE \nAnd he’s not just some powerless left behind avatar, you know? We’re talking \nabout ‘The Archivist’. \nBASIRA \n(Sharp) Yeah okay, you’ve made your point. (sighing) Would just be nice to \nknow for sure. \nGEORGIE \nAll we can do is hope. \nBASIRA \nI suppose. \n(Beat) \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 200 – Last Words \n27 \n(Georgie sighs) \nGEORGIE \nWe should go. It’ll be dark soon, and we still need batteries for the nightlights. \nMELANIE \nAnd I’m sure Rosie’s keen for us to take the Admiral back off her hands. \nGEORGIE \nShe’s alright, he’s calmed down a lot. \nMELANIE \nThank god for tinned tuna. \n(Beat) \nCome on. \n[Melanie extends her mobility cane] \nBASIRA \nWhat do you want me to do with this? \nGEORGIE \nLeave it. We’re done with tapes. \nMELANIE \nWant me to smash it? \nBASIRA \nI think… we can probably just turn it off.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 6, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 2997}}
