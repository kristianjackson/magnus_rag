Harriet visibly relaxed when she saw it, and \nmore so when it was closed. The skittish glances and scratching her arms \nstopped almost immediately. I offered her a coffee or tea to warm up. She just \nasked for a glass of water, said she was feeling a bit unwell. We sat down and, \nonce I’d fetched her water and fixed myself a coffee, we talked for a while. My \ninstincts had been right – she was a student, studying art. She hadn’t been in \nLondon long, she said, was originally from Salisbury and had been finding it… \ndifficult recently. When she left that pause, I saw in her eyes hints of that panic \nI’d seen on the street. \nI asked her to tell me what was wrong, said something was clearly bothering \nher and I’d like to help. She got very quiet for a few moments and then \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG006 – Squirm \n5 \n \nnodded. She told me she’d been mugged the night before last, although the \nway she said the word “mugged” made it sound like she wasn’t sure. I just \nnodded and let her continue talking. She lived up in Archway, on a street \nnamed Elthorne Road, and had been walking home around midnight when she \nsaw a woman lying face down on the pavement. This woman wore a long red \ndress and Harriet said she could see it shifting in the orange glow of the \nstreetlamps, as though something was moving underneath it. Harriet was close \nto her house, which she shared with several other students, so she said she \nwas maybe less careful than she should have been and had approached, calling \nout and asking if the woman needed help. There was no response but all \nmovement stopped and the red dress went very still. Suddenly, far quicker \nthan Harriet could have expected the woman leapt to her feet and sprinted \ndirectly towards her, seizing her by the shoulders and pushing her back against \na nearby wall. It happened so fast the Harriet said she had never really gotten \na good look at the woman beyond her dress, a head of long, matted black hair \nand wide, staring eyes. The woman growled something at her but Harriet \ncouldn’t make it out. She tried to ask what the mugger wanted, but as she did \nshe felt a sudden pain in her stomach, as though she’d been stabbed, which is \nexactly what she thought had happened. She told me that she had fallen to the \nground and lost consciousness almost immediately. \nWhen she awoke, the woman in the red dress was gone. Harriet had expected \nto find herself lying in a pool of blood from her stomach wound but could \ninstead find no trace of any injury anywhere, except for some scraped knees \nwhere she had fallen to the floor. She had staggered home and tried to sleep it \noff. Since then, she said she’d been seeing that woman everywhere she went. \nShe felt like she was being followed all the time and couldn’t stay in her own \nhome, as whenever she did it was like this weight was dragging her down.
