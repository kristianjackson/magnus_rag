I could never bring myself to say anything or even \nmake a sound when her eyes fell on me. I barely had enough wherewithal to \nconfirm her order, even if it was always the same: a large cup of black coffee, \nwith enough room for milk. She never actually put any milk in it. She never \neven drank it. She’d just take it over and sit there, staring out the window into \nthe street for an hour or so. It wasn’t like there was much a view, just a normal \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG067 – Burning Desire \n \n3 \n \nstreet, and outside, Sheffield city centre. That’s not much of a view at all. Still, \nshe’d sit there, staring, alone with her thoughts for about an hour, then stand \nup and leave. I’d go over to clear away her coffee and it was always scalding \nhot. \n \nIt was such a strange little routine and I would spend time wondering to myself \nwhat she could possibly be thinking about. What was her life that every \nTuesday at three in the afternoon she came into the same cafe and didn’t drink \na black coffee? The way she always used to order the coffee, it always sounded \nlike she was enjoying it. The order, I mean. Like the phrase, “One black coffee \nwith room for milk” was a delightfully novel thing for her to say. \n \nIn the year and a bit leading up to my finally talking to her, I only ever saw two \noccasions where she wasn’t sitting alone. The first was when another man \nattempted to chat her up. At least, I assume that’s what he was doing. I didn’t \nrecognise him, but you can always tell when someone starts a conversation \nwith a motive like that. He walked over and started saying something or other, \ncocky as anything. Agnes, though I didn’t know her name back then, just \nlooked up and met his eyes and I could see him start to falter. Sweat began to \nroll down his forehead, but he kept talking. Then Agnes went to stand up. It \nwas only a very small movement, but the man started as though a gun had \ngone off, knocking into the table and spilling coffee all over his hand. It had \nbeen sat there almost 40 minutes, but I could see his flesh start to redden with \nburns where the liquid had touched it. He screamed and suddenly all eyes \nwere on him. His face went almost the same colour as his burned hand, and he \nshouted something vague at us about suing us over the temperature and ran \nout the door in pain and embarrassment. Suffice it to say we did not hear from \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG067 – Burning Desire \n \n4 \n \nhis lawyers. That was the day I noticed the slight scorch marks on the chair \nAgnes had been sat on, though at the time I didn’t connect the two. \n \nThe other time was about near the end of October last year. I remember \nbecause Dalia had been ranting at me about how impossible it was to get a \ndecent women’s Halloween costume that didn’t, as she put it, “show a mile of \nskin.” I was making some weak joke about going as a bedsheet ghost and \ntelling everyone it was sexy because the ghost was technically naked, when I \nlooked over and saw someone else sat at the table with Agnes. She was a short \nAsian woman with close cropped hair and a thick, muscular frame. I remember \nbeing a bit surprised that she seemed to be just wearing a tank top, given how \ncold it was starting to get, but it did show off a rather intimidating back tattoo \nof what looked to be a man wreathed in the fires of hell. I still remember how \ndisconcerting I found that screaming face, contorting in the agony of inked on \nfire. \n \nWeirder than all that though, was the fact that Agnes appeared to be talking to \nher, actually saying words that weren’t an order for coffee or a thank you. Her \nvoice was soft and I couldn’t make out any of the words. I mean, I know I \nshouldn’t have been trying to listen – I know it’s a creepy thing to do – but you \ndon’t understand how momentous an occasion this was, to see this beautiful \nwoman whose name I still didn’t know finally talking to another human being. \nIt was incredible. The shorter woman’s voice was loud though and she made \nno attempt at subtlety in her conversation. She was talking about some sort of \njob and whether Agnes was going to be able to do it.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 1, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 4392}}
