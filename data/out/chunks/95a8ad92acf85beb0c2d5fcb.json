Then he picked up the knife, walked over to me \nand cut through the cable ties keeping me in place. He started to pull me to my \nfeet before I could protest about my ankle, but surprisingly, it seemed to bear \nmy weight without any problems. I looked down and, although I could plainly \nsee dried blood all around it, my ankle was... fine. I stared in disbelief, then \nlooked at my right hand, which still seemed to have all five fingers. It didn’t \nmake any sense. I could still see the ones he had cut-off on the pile. One of \nthem bore my heavy silver ring, while the same finger on my hand did not. I \n\nstarted to say something about this to Leroy, but as I did there was a sudden \nheat from behind me. \nWe turned to see one of the candles had been pushed onto the pile of bibles, \nsetting them almost instantly ablaze. I looked around quickly for anything to \ndouse the flames, but I could see nothing, and the fire was already starting to \nspread up the wall. Leroy and I ran, keen to get away before the fire brigade or \npolice arrived. I didn’t see what happened to the man who had been cutting \nme, and we didn’t stay to watch the old takeaway go up in flames. \nIt’s still there, you know. Now a gutted, empty shell, smoke-blackened through \nthe windows. I wonder if they’ll ever get around to tearing it down. It doesn’t \nreally matter, though. I’ve decided to move. \nARCHIVIST \nStatement ends. \nMeat again. Not quite in the volumes of some previous statements, but still, a \ntheme that continues to disconcert. First point to make is that I believe Mr. \nGoodall gave us a fake name and details when making his statement, as \nneither myself nor Sasha have been able to find any record of him to follow up, \ncertainly none that match Martin’s admittedly vague recollections about the \nman. Tim has confirmed the 27th of September 2009 as the date of the fire \nthat destroyed the takeaway in question, which was registered as “Waltham \nExpress Grill”, but can find no record of anything out of the ordinary about the \nfire, which was put down to unknown local vandals. We’ve also been unable to \nfind anything on a teenager being picked up for trespass on that property, \nthough that’s not a particular surprise. \n\nI’ve had Martin looking into the case of John Haan, though it’s slow going as \nwhenever there’s a picture he ends up needing to take a breath of fresh air. \nApparently Haan was second-generation British Chinese, marrying his wife \nLanying shortly after she arrived in the country and setting up Waltham \nExpress Grill. He seems to have been utterly normal, according to the \ntestimony of his former employees. What Martin did find, is that according to \ncoroner there was a noticeable lack of defensive wounds on what remained of \nLanying’s body, and some of the injuries seemed like they might have been \nself-inflicted. From my perspective, however, what is more interesting is that \nsix months before his arrest, John Haan let the last of his staff go and replaced \nthem with a nephew of his who had recently moved over from China. The \nnephew’s name was Haan Tao, although upon moving to this country he took \nthe name ‘Tom Haan’. I’ve checked, and this is the same Tom Haan who was \nemployed at the Dalston meat processing plant from late 2009 until his \ndisappearance in 2013. \nI doubt this is the last we hear of him and his strange relationship with meat. \nEnd recording \n[Tape clicks off. Tape clicks on.] \nARCHIVIST \nSupplemental. \nI still haven’t been back down in the tunnels, though my earlier conversation \nwith Basira puts me in some hopes that I may be able to request help with it \nsooner rather than later. Only to wait and see what comes of this operation of \nhers. I rather hope that she… I hope she’s okay.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 5, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 3845}}
