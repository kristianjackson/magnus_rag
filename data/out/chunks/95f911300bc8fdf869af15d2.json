Toby had always \nbeen into all of that mystical crap, even before the drugs, and if there was \nsome half-baked New Age fad going round you could bet you’d find it dribbling \nout of his mouth whenever he was coherent enough to actually talk. I punched \nhim in the gut and turned to leave. He followed me, doubled over and \nstruggling for breath, begging me to help him. He said he was serious, said it \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG014 – Piecemeal \n4 \n \nwasn’t like the other stuff, said he knew someone with real power, who could \nput the hurt on Noriega, but he just didn’t have the money. \nI should have kept walking. I should have shaken him off. I should have beat \nhim so bad he couldn’t turn his neck the other way either. But I didn’t. I \nstopped and I listened to what that piece of human garbage had to say. I was \nan idiot. \nSo Toby took me to see his friend Angela. He never gave me her second name. \nI asked him what it was: Wicca, voodoo, some crystal bull? But Toby said no, \nnothing like that. Said he didn’t really know how it was supposed to work, but \nhad a girl a few months back, had told him about Angela; said she’d used her \nservices on a particularly unpleasant ex-boyfriend. Apparently he’d \ndisappeared, and they never found a body. So then I’m thinking maybe there’s \nno magic there, just a killer with a schtick, but hey, if that was the case it was \nfine by me, just as long as Noriega got done. \nWhen I finally met Angela, it was all I could do not to cave McMullen’s head in. \nI’d just about convinced myself I was going to be meeting with a hardened \nkiller, maybe one that kept a bunch of spooky Halloween crap around, but still \nsomeone who’d get the job done. I wasn’t even put off when we pulled up to a \nwell-kept suburban house in Bexley. But when the door was answered by an \nold lady in a lilac dressing gown, I almost lost it. McMullen asked if she was \nAngela, speaking in a quiet voice like he was actually scared of the geriatric \nfool. The old woman said yes, she was Angela, and asked us to come in. \nThe house felt almost as old as its owner – faded floral print wallpaper, dark \noak furniture and threadbare carpets. The walls were covered with framed \nportraits, the sort you’d get in any cheap antique store or charity shop, \nalthough as we went into the living room I noticed something that I didn’t \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG014 – Piecemeal \n5 \n \nexpect: they weren’t paintings, they were jigsaw puzzles, each completed and \nframed. And sure enough when we sat down on the worn cloth sofa, there in \nfront of Angela was another jigsaw, halffinished. I’ve got no problem with the \nelderly, and if they want to throw away their last years putting together a \ndamn picture then I’m sure not going to stop them, but it wasn’t exactly going \nto kill Noriega, was it? \nI was so angry at this massive waste of my time, that when she offered us a \ncup of coffee, I almost put McMullen face-first through the glass table in front \nof us. I grunted something which Angela apparently took as a “yes please”, and \nso a few minutes later there I was drinking instant coffee from a chipped mug \nthat this doddering old ass clearly hadn’t thought to wipe the dust off of. When \nshe asked if I wanted Paul Noriega dead, I nearly choked. \nShe asked it very matter-of-factly, like it was a question on some form she \nknew the answer to but had to fill it in anyway. I glanced at Toby, who nodded \nat me, and I thought what the hell, I might as well play along. So I said yes. Yes, \nI did want him dead. And more than that, I wanted him to suffer. Angela smiled \nwhen I said that, a warm smile that suited her round face, and said that that \nwouldn’t be a problem. I started to explain the situation, but she waved it \naway and told me that Toby had filled her in on all the details, and that there \nwas just one thing she needed from me, that he couldn’t provide. I started to \ntell her that I wasn’t paying for someone’s gran to take out a hard case like \nNoriega, but she said no, she wasn’t after money. She said that she was “well-\ncompensated” for the service she provided and that all she needed from me \nwas an object, anything that I had taken from Noriega.
