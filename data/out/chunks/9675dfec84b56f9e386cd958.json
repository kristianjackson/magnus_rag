Yeah? I get it. \nSo, anyway, I spend a lot of time at the dump. Not so much those huge iron \nskips or the bottle bank – I mean, like I don’t have enough bottles in my studio \nalready - but you know the bit in the middle where they sell stuff. All the stuff \nthat really skirts the line between trash and treasure. Mirrors that are \ntarnished but still good. Old furniture just a bit too scuffed for the charity shop. \nYou can get amazing things there for almost nothing if you look hard and aren’t \ntoo picky. And when you’re making art you don’t need to be picky. If \nsomething’s not perfect, you can make it perfect. You use the beauty inside of \n\nyou to reach in and pull the beauty out of the object. Sometimes by breaking it \nmore; sometimes by repairing it just enough. And, once, by setting it on fire. So \nthe people at the dump around my area they know me and generally when I \nturn up they key me in to any of the good stuff that’s come in. \nSo, I was checking out the tip near Wood Green two days ago and they don’t \nusually have a lot of good stuff. I mean, I’ve been there sometimes when \nthere’s literally no stuff out for sale but this time they had a few furniture \npieces and a cutlery set, but nothing I could use. But one of the guys who \nworks there, I think his name’s Gus. Or Al. He looks like a Gus or an Al. Anyway, \nhe pointed me to the only thing that really caught my attention. It was a wicker \nbasket full of old books. Now this I was interested in. I’m working on a piece at \nthe moment, it’s called ‘Pageviews’ and it’s about the death of print media at \nthe dawn of the digital age. Point is, I’m filling a bunch of computer monitors \nwith shredded books, so cheap books, especially a bit old and a bit yellowed, \nwere exactly what I needed. I discarded a few of them as the texture or page \ntone wasn’t quite right but there were plenty in there I could use. Then I \nspotted a book that looked a bit older than the others, right at the bottom. It \nwas large, and the pages looked thick and loose. It was titled The Tale of a Field \nHospital by Frederick Treeves. So clearly I’m buying it, right? I mean, obviously \nyou know Frederick Treeves, the surgeon who was best friends with Joseph \nMerrick, AKA the Elephant Man, AKA my all-time favourite Victorian medical \ncuriosity. And not just because he shares my name though I guess that doesn’t \nhurt. \nI mean, I knew about the book; Treeves’ account of his time working in a field \nhospital during the Second Boer War. I’d read it before, of course, but my copy \n\nhad gone missing about the time Sandra moved out. She wasn’t exactly a fan \nand I think she threw away a whole bunch of my stuff out of spite. \nThing is, this one looked old. Like, 19th century old, which, since that’s when \nhe was writing meant there was a good chance it was a first edition and that \nsort of thing can be very valuable. Meaning I get a good read and a payday. \nWin win, right? \nSo I buy it, for like 50p and head off, but it’s weird. Don’t know who owned it \nbefore, might have even have been a library copy but the sticker was mostly \ntorn off. It didn’t have a frontispiece, though, and a lot of the pages had \ndifferent ink weights or layouts, and it kind of looks like they were printed at \ndifferent times. It’s only when I get home that I remember The Tale of a Field \nHospital was actually based on a series of short columns he wrote for the \nBritish Medical Journal during the war itself. So I reckon what I’ve got here \nmight just be some kind of proofing or draft copy, or maybe some custom-\nbound collection of those articles, and I get really excited. \nAs I started reading through it, though, there was something kind of weird. Bits \nof some of the chapters that I really don’t remember from the version I read \nbefore. The book’s old and dirty and kind of tricky to just read, so I copied \ndown a few passages for you. \nSo, almost halfway through, Chapter Thirteen, he talks about “The Men with \nthe Spades” - the soldiers who came up every day to dig the graves for those \nwho had died in the hospital. He describes them as “unkempt and uncaring, \ntheir devil-may-care attitude hiding the deep sadness within them at their \nsolemn duty”. Except, in the version I have, it goes like this:", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 1, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 4319}}
