I can’t say I was particularly upset. The Human \nAnatomy module is where a lot of the engineers discover just how messy the \nhuman body is, and while the human heart is a phenomenal piece of \nmachinery in terms of design and function, most of the students would be \nmore comfortable holding a transistor. Not to put too fine a point on it, I get \ntired of… squeamish students, and was glad that I could avoid it this year. \nYou can perhaps imagine, then, that I was not best pleased when Elena Bower, \nthe admissions officer, emailed me last November to say that there had been a \nmistake, and I was needed to take a ‘spillover class’. Apparently the system \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG034 – Anatomy Class \n5 \n \nhad accepted more students for the course than there were places, and they \nwere trying to organise an additional class for the seven who were unassigned. \nIt didn’t make a lot of sense to me, Anatomy class wasn’t until the second \nterm, so surely this mistake should have emerged earlier, but Elena just kept \nsaying she didn’t know, she just had seven students who needed tutorials. I \nwon’t pretend I took the news gracefully. I have a lot of research due shortly \nand, well, you know academia – never enough hours in the day. Still, I was the \nonly staff member both qualified to teach the class and technically free when it \nhad to be scheduled. So I agreed, although that really makes it sound like I had \nmore of a choice than I actually did. \nI didn’t meet the students until the module started this January. I wasn’t \nresponsible for any of the lectures, so the first time I saw them was in our \ninitial class tutorial. They all sat there, all seven, staring at me, and I felt… oddly \nuncomfortable. There, there was nothing wrong with them, of course, nothing \nstrange to see or to look at, just... well, this is going to sound stupid to say out \nloud, but I don’t remember what they look like. Any of them. I remember that \neach wore blue jeans and a white shirt, though they were all different makes \nand styles; I think one of the girls had a skirt, instead. I must have noticed that \nthey were wearing the same outfits, but it didn’t strike me as odd. They all just \nlooked so… normal. Unremarkable. I remember their names, though, from the \nregister. They stuck with me – maybe because they were such an international \ngroup. There was Erika Mustermann, Jan Novak, Piotr and Pavel Petrov, who I \nthink were brothers, maybe twins, John Doe, Fulan al-Fulani and Juan Pérez. \nI greeted them when I entered the room, and was met with silence. Not a \nmalicious or angry silence, just silence. I’ve never been self-conscious when \nteaching, but walking to my seat with those fourteen eyes just… watching me... \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG034 – Anatomy Class \n6 \n \nit made ever so slightly uncomfortable. I got the oddest feeling they were \njudging my walk. \n(Nervous laugh) \nThe class began, and we started going over some of the basics of anatomy and \nhow the body works. They started to talk then, and some of my unease left \nme. I don’t remember exactly what was said, after doing it long enough most \ntutorials just kind of blur together a bit, but I recall being struck by just how \nbasic some of their questions were. The composition of blood, where in the \nbody the various organs sat, the sort of thing that anyone who’s done a science \nGCSE should know. I was almost tempted to ask where they went to school. At \nthe time, I didn’t question the fact that they must have all gone to the same \nschool. \nAside from that it was mostly normal, except... about halfway through the \ntutorial, we discussed the lungs and respiration. Inhalation, alveoli, et cetera. \nAs I said, basic stuff, but I paused afterwards, just to have a think about where \nto go next, and I heard the sound of them breathing. That’s not abnormal, I \nknow, but it seemed to fill the silence so suddenly, and all at once. I could... I \ncould have sworn that I didn’t actually hear it before that moment. Like they’d \nonly just then started breathing. \n(Nervous laugh) \nWhich is, which is absurd, obviously. I was probably just listening out for it \nbecause we’d been discussing the lungs. Even so, it was disconcerting, and I \ndon’t mind telling you that I breathed quite a sigh of relief myself when the \ntutorial was over and I could get out of there.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 1, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 4390}}
