Episode one hundred and twenty-\ntwo. Zombie. \n[Tape clicks on. Sound of clock ticking. Voices are slightly muffled] \nBASIRA \nWell? \nGEORGIE \nIt was just there. \nBASIRA \nCould he have come back, moved it? \nGEORGIE \nI guess. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 122 – Zombie \n \n2 \n \nBASIRA \nAnd you’re sure you didn’t recognise him? \nGEORGIE \nNo. No, he was, um… I’d never seen him before. \nBASIRA \nBut? \nGEORGIE \nHe, uh, he felt like Death. \nBASIRA \nWhat, capital ‘D’ Death? \nGEORGIE \nYeah, you know, one of your dark gods. \nBASIRA \nThey’re not— \nLook, I’m trying to help. You came to me. \nGEORGIE \nI came to Melanie. \nBASIRA \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 122 – Zombie \n \n3 \n \nWell, sorry. right now, I’m it. \n… \nSo, John told you then? \nGEORGIE \nSome of it. Not everything. \nBASIRA \nRight. So how exactly is it that you’re able to identify an avatar of The End on \nsight? \nGEORGIE \nHonestly, Basira, it’s not your business. \nSorry. \nBASIRA \n(Sigh) Alright. And you don’t know why this guy would have left a tape \nrecorder? \nGEORGIE \nYou’re the detective. \nBASIRA \nAnd you’re sure it was him who left it? \nGEORGIE \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 122 – Zombie \n \n4 \n \nI mean, the nurses said there were no other visitors, so unless it appeared by \nmagic? What, seriously? \nBASIRA \nI don’t know. The whole tape thing is... I don’t know. \nGEORGIE \nRight. Well, I showed you like you asked, so... \nBASIRA \nShh. \n[Fabric moves; voices become clearer] \nDown here! \n[Tape recorder is picked up and put on table] \nGEORGIE \nI told you. \nBASIRA \nThis is the one? \nGEORGIE \nSure. \nBASIRA \nYou don’t sound very sure. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 122 – Zombie \n \n5 \n \nGEORGIE \nI mean, I don’t know, it might be a different model, maybe? I thought it was \nplastic, but, yeah. So, what does it mean? \nARCHIVIST \n(Weakly) That’s a very good question. \nGEORGIE \nJohn! \nBASIRA \nOh Jesus! \nARCHIVIST \n(Hoarsely) Sorry. Didn’t mean to scare you. \nGEORGIE \nI’ll get a nurse. \nBASIRA \nWait. \nGEORGIE \nBasira. \nBASIRA \nJohn, is it still… you? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 122 – Zombie \n \n6 \n \nARCHIVIST \nUh, y-yes. Yes, I-I think so? I, uh, I don’t know how you’d prove it though. \nGEORGIE \nEnough, just stay still. I’ll get a nurse. \nARCHIVIST \nUh, no, I, uh, I’m alright. \n[Bedclothes rustle] \nGEORGIE \nStop it. \nARCHIVIST \nI’m okay. \nGEORGIE \nJohn, you are not okay. You have been in a coma. \nARCHIVIST \nWait, wait. How long? \nBASIRA \nSix months. Give or take. \nARCHIVIST \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 122 – Zombie \n \n7 \n \nSix… Uh, the others? T-Tim, is he...? \n… \nOh. \nBASIRA \nDaisy too. \nARCHIVIST \nI’m sorry. \nBASIRA \nYeah. \nARCHIVIST \nRight. \nGEORGIE \nJohn. \nARCHIVIST \nIt’s alright. \nGEORGIE \nJust stay still, please. How are you feeling? \nARCHIVIST \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 122 – Zombie \n \n8 \n \nHonestly, I, I think I’m alright. \n(Georgie sighs deeply) \nARCHIVIST \nI mean, that’s… good, right? I— \nGEORGIE \nAfter a six-month coma? No, it’s not. This isn’t how it’s supposed to go, John. \nARCHIVIST \nI— What? Y-You’d prefer I was... brain damaged? D-Dead? \nBASIRA \nJohn… \nARCHIVIST \nWhat? \nBASIRA \nGeorgie, could you give us a minute? There are some things we should \nprobably discuss? \nGEORGIE \n(Irritated) Fine. \nARCHIVIST \nGeorgie, I— \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 122 – Zombie \n \n9 \n \nGEORGIE \nJohn, if this really is a second chance, please try to take it. But I don’t think that \nit is. \nARCHIVIST \nGeorgie, I don’t—! \nGEORGIE \nTake care of yourself. \n(The Archivist sighs and attempts to speak) \n[Door opens and closes as Georgie leaves] \nARCHIVIST \nWhat about you? Disappointed to see me alive? \nBasira? \nBASIRA \nWe can deal with it later. \nARCHIVIST \nYeah, okay. \nBASIRA \nDo you want me to grab you some water, or...? \nARCHIVIST \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 122 – Zombie \n \n10 \n \nNo, the, uh, uh, the statement. In your, in your bag. \nBASIRA \nOh. Yeah, I, uh... \n[Zip opens] \nBASIRA \nI just grabbed one on the way out. I thought maybe you’d need it for— \nARCHIVIST \nYou, you were right. I, I think it would do me some good. Do you have a tape \nre— Oh. \nBASIRA \nHow did you know I brought one? \n… \nRight. \nARCHIVIST \nThank you, Basira. \nBASIRA \nHmm. \n[Door opens and closes]", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 0, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 4333}}
