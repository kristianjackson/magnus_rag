You see, there is quite a significant \nhistory of schizophrenia among the men in my family. My father had it, as did \nmy great uncle, and in both of their cases it led to suicide. I didn’t know much \nabout my great uncle but I had seen my father’s decline first hand. It had \nstarted shortly after his divorce from my mother, although thinking about it; it \nwas perhaps the early stages that had exacerbated the problems in their \nmarriage. Regardless, he began to spend a lot of time locked in his study doing \n“his work”. I was maybe 24 or 25 at the time and still living at home. I was \nworking with my dad, doing much the same job as I do now, and it was at this \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG008 – Burned Out \n5 \n \npoint I had to take on more and more of the actual running of the business, \nsince my father was beginning to prioritise his “work” over his actual job. His \n“work” turned out to be fractals. He became obsessed with them, seemed to \nspend all of his time drawing them, staring at them, measuring the patterns \nthey created. He would talk to me for hours about the maths behind them and \ntell me that he was on the verge of a great truth. He was going to shake \nmathematics to its foundations once he figured out this truth, hidden in those \ncascading fractal patterns. \nOne day I returned home to find my father staring through the blinds in terror. \nHe claimed that someone was following him, told me that they were planning \nto stop his work. I asked him who it was but he shook his head violently and \nsaid I’d know him when I saw him because “all the bones are in his hands”. I \ntried to get him help, of course I did, but he refused to take any medication as \nhe said it interfered with his work, and he wasn’t dangerous so I couldn’t have \nhim committed. I knew it was only a matter of time before he hurt himself and \nsure enough the day came when he wouldn’t answer the knocks on his study \ndoor. I broke in to find him lying dead in a pool of blood, with deep gouges \nalong his wrists and arms. The walls were covered in fractal drawings, every \nsurface was piled high with them and pencil shavings littered the floor. The \ninquest ruled his death a suicide, although the coroner wasn’t able to identify \nthe tool that had made the cuts on his arms or why he had such a look of fear \non his face. \nThis is why the apparent disappearance of Raymond Fielding worried me so \nmuch. I was younger than my father had been but still had that possibility \nwithin me. This train of thought was likely why I wasn’t paying as much \nattention as I should have been where I was stepping and I slipped on the wet", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 2, "chunk_count": 9, "chars": 2723}}
