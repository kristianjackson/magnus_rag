Such a simple word. Home — not house, not dwelling, not residence or \naddress— \n[Hissing static ends] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \n—not domicile or flat or lodging or abode or apartment or property or \naccommodation. Home. \nA structure of brick or wood or concrete or canvas. A box in which you pack \nyourself away when the long day is done. A book neatly closed and placed \nsnugly on a shelf. There's no place like home. An Englishman's home is his \ncastle. Home is where the heart is. \nAnd home is where that heart can be hurt most severely, because within that \nplace of safety, the warm and welcoming embrace of the cramped and well-\ntrod floors whose layout has ingrained itself into your soul, there you are most \nvulnerable. Your home is an extension of yourself, as much as you will let it be, \nand the place and the people and the things that form it and fill it are as much \na part of you as your blood. As your bile. As your tears. \nPerhaps you know the feeling that comes rushing over you when your home is \ncompromised, invaded, corrupted. Perhaps a burglary gives lie to the promise \nof safety you took from a flimsy front door and a cheap lock. Maybe the dirt \nand grime builds up to such a degree that the stench begins to infect your soul, \nor an infestation of moths or ants or bed bugs stretches itself throughout the \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 169 – Fire Escape \n13 \nvery structure of your home until it feels like your skin is squirming with them. \nYou may even find yourself living with a hostile, toxic presence, be they family, \nfriend, or stranger, that poisons your home, turning blessed relief and rest \nfrom the tribulations of the world into a choking fog of anxiety and fear. \nSuch are the dangers of a rotten home. \nBut how many truly control their home? How many have extended their soul \ninto the walls of a place that exists only at the whim of those who would let \nthem die in the street were it not for the gain that can be squeezed from them. \nA home you cannot control, that you cannot even be sure will exist with the \nturning of the seasons. Where stability and peace rot in calamity, exist only at \nthe behest of faceless names that lace themselves throughout labyrinthine \npaperwork, chaining you to the front of a truck whose motion you cannot \ncontrol. \nDo you smell smoke? Do you smell the creeping ruin of a life, a stalking \ncreature of unmaintained electricals, of cheap insulation, of cut corners and \nmissing fire alarms and unenforced safety regulations? Do you see it creeping \nunder the door to your bedroom as you sleep, the burning coals of its eyes \nregarding you in the supposed safety of your home, not indifferent but hungry, \neager to take everything from you, to burn down your life in any sense it can \nreach. Can you hear the crackling promise of kindled despair that it whispers \ninto your uneasy, dreaming ear? \nSabina senses it, feels it drawing near. \nHow long has she lived here? How long have these cramped, dingy rooms in \nthe back of this sprawling rundown tenement been the place her heart calls \nhome?
