The danger is real, as is the faint, hardened fear in your gut, but I've \nalways found that it sometimes put me in a state not too unlike how it feels \nstaring into the flames of a fire. Hypnotic – my mind cleared of all thoughts but \nthe dull, pulsing rush of adrenaline. That feeling was so strong here that I \nalmost swam past The Maria Fairchild completely. \nJulio was already inside and I quickly located a large enough tear in the hull \nand made my own entrance. The yacht was bigger than I had thought when \nviewing it from the boat, but the layout was not complicated, and we already \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG051 – High Pressure \n6 \n \nhad quite a good idea about where would be best to look for the sort of \nantiques and sentimental treasures that Simon wanted. Julio had taken the \nbedroom, so I started on the bridge. It was certainly an impressive sight – a \nlate 19th century steam yacht, slightly decayed from its time on the ocean \nfloor, but all in all, astoundingly well preserved. I looked over the chair and the \nvarious panels and controls, but could find nothing which could be classed as \nan easily removable heirloom, although I did make a mental note of which bits \nof the bridge were well enough preserved that they might be worth removing. \nIt would need more equipment than we had with us, but I could suggest it to \nSimon if we returned empty-handed. \nI checked in on Julio, but he was still busy ransacking the bedroom, so I \ndecided to do a sweep of the engine room, and it was there I found the hole. It \nwas large, maybe 7 feet in diameter, not unlike the one I had used to get into \nthe wreck in the first place. But there was something about it that immediately \nput me on edge. The shape was too regular somehow, the water outside it was \ntoo dark and – it took me a few seconds to notice this – but the direction of the \ntearing seemed to indicate it had been made from the inside out. I dropped \nthe rusted wrench I had been examining and let it float slowly towards the \nfloor as I made my way to the hole. I gripped the side and looked through. \nAs soon as I put my head through, I felt a change wash over me. The pressure \nincreased all at once, becoming so intense that I screamed in surprise and pain \nas my head erupted in agony. The pressure was upon my whole body now and \nI was finding it hard to move with the crushing weight on every part of me. My \neyes bulged as I stared forward and I saw two things: the first was that below \nthe hole there was no sea floor, just a deep and endless expanse of empty \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG051 – High Pressure \n7 \n \nwater, as though the boat were on a cliff edge; the second was that it was far, \nfar too dark. \nThe deepest that humans can survive in the ocean is the mesopelagic zone, \nwhich begins roughly 650 feet below the surface. It is colloquially known \namong oceanographers as the twilight zone, as it is the level where only the \nfaintest of light penetrates from the sun and the water can only be seen in the \nmany shades of darkness. Down that far, any glow that makes it is so diffused \nas to be utterly useless in determining which way is up. But as I stared out in \nterror, I was absolutely sure that there was no up and I could swim as far as I \nliked, but there would never be anything but water. \nThen I saw it. It was only a shadow in the dark, but it was there and it was \nhuge. It stretched from one side of my vision to the other and, as I fought \nagainst the pressure to turn my aching head, I still couldn't see the end of it, \nonly its blurred outline was slightly better contrasted against the lighter shade \nof the twilight water that surrounded it. I could not see the ends of it. It was so \nbig it made me lightheaded to think about it, to try and place myself in some \nbelievable scale against it. I think it was a hand, but I could not see enough to \nbe sure. Then it moved, slowly but clearly, and I realised how far away it still \nwas, as it got bigger and bigger and bigger and I could see nothing else and I \nscreamed. \nIt was the jagged metal of the hole itself that saved me in the end. As I cried \nout in horror, I felt the sharp edges of it digging into my hands and they \ngripped it, and the unexpected burst of pain snapped me out of whatever it \nwas that held me in place. With a surge of strength, I pushed myself back into \nthe boat and I felt the pressure l", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 3, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 4500}}
