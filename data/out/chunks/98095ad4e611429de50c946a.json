It hurts, most of the time. I don’t like it. \nGERTRUDE \nBut, you’re still here. \nERIC \nI suppose. Mary used to get me up to bounce ideas off of. Talk through her \nthoughts and theories. Never listened to me, obviously, but (light, pointed) \nnothing new there. \nGERTRUDE \nWell, it’s good to see you. I suppose. \nERIC \nYou too. (beat) You got old. \nGERTRUDE \nBetter than being dead. \nERIC \n(Short sigh of a laugh) Fair enough. To be honest, I’m impressed, more than \nanything. Hard to get old in this business. You either die, or you, uh, stay \nyoung. (short, uncomfortable pause) How did Mary look? \nGERTRUDE \n(same sort of short laugh) She got old, too. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 154 – Bloody Mary \nERIC \nS’pose that makes sense. And Gerry? Have you seen my son? \nGERTRUDE \nNo; I’ve never met him, I’m afraid. Mary talks of him a lot. Well, she seems \nvery proud. \nERIC \nThat’s...not as reassuring as you think it is. \nGERTRUDE \nI see your point. \n(Short pause.) \nERIC \nWhy did she give me to you? \nGERTRUDE \nI- I don’t know. She seemed to think it was a gift. \nERIC \nMm, charming. \nGERTRUDE \nShe said she had one final mystery to explore. With the book. \nERIC \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 154 – Bloody Mary \nOh. Oh. You know what that means, don’t you? \nGERTRUDE \nI have a pretty strong suspicion, yes. \n(Eric makes a small noise.) \nGERTRUDE \nWhat? \nERIC \nOh, just thinking. Five years as her husband, god knows how many as her \npossession, and she just couldn’t stand being bound in the same book as me. \nGERTRUDE \nHm. I’m sorry. \nERIC \nYeah, it doesn’t feel great. But being dead, I s’pose you don’t feel things quite \nas strongly. Little bit- flat. \nI’m aware of the heartbreak, but I don’t know if I actually feel it. It’s strange, \nreally. \nGERTRUDE \nYes. Yes, it sounds it. \n(Eric takes a slow, deep breath.) \n \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 154 – Bloody Mary \nERIC \nSo, what now? \nGERTRUDE \nI’m not entirely sure. I was probably going to burn you, if you’re amenable to \nthe idea. \nERIC \nYes. Yes, I think that would be for the best. \nGERTRUDE \nI’m just trying to figure out if there was a reason she gave you to me. The way \nshe was smiling... as if she was handing over a secret. \nERIC \nI don’t know. (sigh) Do you have any questions? Any unfinished business? \nGERTRUDE \n(heh-hm) Of course. When she killed you, there were plenty of outstanding \ncases and such, but nothing that would still be relevant. \nERIC \nSorry, what do you mean? \nGERTRUDE \nWell, you were working on quite a few statements when she killed you. \nERIC \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 154 – Bloody Mary \nGertrude, I left the Archives months before she killed me. \nGERTRUDE \nWhat? No. That’s- That’s not possible. \nERIC \nOf course. They didn’t tell you. Why would they? Mary probably thought it was \nfunnier if you didn’t know, and Wright would have preferred you not to know. \nHow is he, by the way? \nGERTRUDE \nJames? He died about twelve years ago. Elias is Head of the Institute now. \nERIC \nElias? Elias Bouchard, seriously? \nGERTRUDE \nHm, he’s changed a lot. \nERIC \nMust have! \nGERTRUDE \nSo. What did they not want me to know? \nERIC \nI quit. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 154 – Bloody Mary \nGERTRUDE \nYou- Sorry, you quit? \nERIC \nYeah. I figured out how. \nGERTRUDE \nI- I just assumed- \nHow? \nERIC \nWell, that’s it, isn’t it? I suppose that’s why she gave me to you. One final \nscrew you to the Eye. \nGERTRUDE \nEric. How did you quit? \n(Eric holds back.) \nGERTRUDE \n(warning) Eric. \nERIC \n(short laugh) Sorry. I just- (laugh) I don’t mean to be a dick, but- well, it’s been \na long time since I’ve had any sort of- leverage, I guess? Just a- little bit of \npower. \nIt’s kind of nice. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 154 – Bloody Mary \nGERTRUDE \nAre you going to tell me? \nERIC \nThinking about it. \nGERTRUDE \nThink harder. \nERIC \nYou know, you were never actually all that nice to me when I worked for you, \nGertrude. Not like Michael, or Emma. \nGERTRUDE \nEric. \nERIC \nWhat, you gonna threaten me? Look at me. Best I can currently hope for is to \nbe burnt to ash. (inhale, sharp sigh) I’m going to tell you, just- maybe there’s a \nprice? \nGERTRUDE \nWhat do you want? \nERIC \nI don’t know- I haven’t had a chance to think. \nGERTRUDE", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 1, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 4220}}
