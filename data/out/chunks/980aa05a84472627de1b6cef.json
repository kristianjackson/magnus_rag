I… I um... I nee-need a... I've been thinking of it a-as an \nanchor. I think. I... know. Something I have a connection to, th-that I can use to \nfind my way out of the Coffin when I reach Daisy. I-I figured the strongest \nanchor would be… part of my own body. \nMELANIE \nOkay. So… just cut it off. \nARCHIVIST \nI’m doing my best. \nMELANIE \nHmph. Can’t go through with it? \nARCHIVIST \nOh, th-the blade keeps going in. And… it hurts. Hurts plenty. But then it heals \nup. Pretty much the moment I take it out. No wound, no scar, nothing. \nMELANIE \n\nI could try? \nARCHIVIST \nI… don’t think that would be a good idea right now. \nMELANIE \nMaybe not. \nARCHIVIST \nI mean, you'd think I'd have a better idea how to do it. All these… all these \nstatements and... (Small laugh) You know who I need? I need the Boneturner. \n(Sighs) Just reach in and grab a rib. Job done. \nMELANIE \n… \nARCHIVIST \nWhat? Melanie? \nMELANIE \nCome with me. \n[Tape clicks off. Tape clicks on. There’s footsteps on stone. The following \nconversation echoes.] \nARCHIVIST \nI was down here just yesterday, and there wasn’t— \nMELANIE \n\nHere. \nARCHIVIST \nOh. This, this door... It shouldn't be here. \nMELANIE \nYes. \nARCHIVIST \nI, uh... I don’t want to open it. \nI’m not going to. \n(Melanie signs) \n[Melanie knocks at the door.] \nMELANIE \nShe’s been helping us. \nARCHIVIST \n(Sharply) It has never helped anyone. Not without a cost. \n[The door creaks open] \nHELEN \nIf I am an “it”, Archivist, then what does that make you? \n[The door creaks closed] \nMELANIE \n\nHi Helen. \nARCHIVIST \n(Coldly) I have been told you can help. \nHELEN \nI have been trying to. But the last time you were very rude to me. \nARCHIVIST \nYou’re still wearing her face. \nHELEN \nNot this again. I’m not “wearing” anything, Archivist. I am at least as much \n‘Helen Richardson’ as you are the ‘Jonathan Sims’ that first joined this \nInstitute. Things change. People change. It happens. \nARCHIVIST \nWe’re not people, though, are we? Not anymore. \nHELEN \nNames. Categories. It’s all so important to you, isn’t it? You do know none of \nit’s actually real. It's all just meaningless boxes. \nMELANIE \nIs… He still in there? \nHELEN \n\nOh, yes. He’s not exactly something I can... digest. He’s a bit of an irritant, to be \nhonest. If you’re looking to let him out, I could be persuaded. \nARCHIVIST \nWhen did you say they attacked? \nMELANIE \nA couple of months ago. \nARCHIVIST \nAnd he’s been in there… ever since? \nHELEN \nI helped clean up. \nMELANIE \nAfter I, uh... took care of things. \nARCHIVIST \nAll this time. Why didn't anyone tell me? \nMELANIE \nBasira said not to. \nARCHIVIST \nI see. Why didn’t you kill him? \nMELANIE \n\nI stabbed him in three different hearts. Didn’t work. If you want to go hunting \nfor a fourth, knock yourself out. \nARCHIVIST \nI...er… I’m alright, I think \nMELANIE \nSo, what’s the plan? \nARCHIVIST \nRight. I go in, I offer freedom if he... helps. Then I hope he doesn’t kill me. If he \ntries anything... \nHELEN \nI would suggest running. Try to find a door. \nARCHIVIST \nNaturally. (Deep breath) Oh, er… Er, pass the recorder? \nMELANIE \nSeriously? Fine. \n[Recorder is passed to the archivist] \nARCHIVIST \nRight. \n\n[The door creaks open. There are footsteps as the Archivist enters. The door \ncreaks closed. The following scene has the echoes and static of the \nDistortion’s corridors.] \nARCHIVIST \nHello? \n[More walking] \nIs, uh... Uh, hello? \n[Keeps walking] \nDid I— \n[Soft squelching steps] \nNo. W-Wait... I came from… \n[Wet, fleshy movement and cracking bones] \nEr, J-Jared Hopworth? \nJARED \nThat’s what it says on me licence. Mind you, the picture’s a bit out of date. \n(Jared laughs a wet, meaty laugh) \nARCHIVIST \nY-yes. \nJARED \n\nI try to kill you. And you throw me in here. And now what? You just walk in? \nARCHIVIST \nI-I didn’t— That wasn’t me. \nJARED \nYour people. Your gaff. \nARCHIVIST \nAnd you wanted to kill... me, specifically? \nJARED \nStill do. \n[Ominous shifting, cracking and popping. Throughout this conversation, \nJared’s speech is accompanied by continuous sounds of wet, mobile meat \nand bone-like clicks and snaps.] \nARCHIVIST \nRight. But… you know if you do, you're never getting out of this place. \nJARED \nWhat do you want? \nARCHIVIST \nI, uh... I want a favour. \nJARED", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 1, "chunk_count": 5, "chars": 4386}}
