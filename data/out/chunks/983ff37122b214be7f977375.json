Easier not to think about \nthem, I guess. Easier to just let them slip away. They can't hurt you if you don't \nthink about them, they can't shout at you or call you names. (emotional) And I, \nI always think of Mum's face when I've done something wrong, and I… wait. \n[Chair creaks] \nMARTIN (CONT'D) \nWait I don’t, her face, I. I don't remember her face. Did, did she have a face? \n(berating) D-don't be-don't be stupid, Martin; of course she had a face! \n(agitated) You just can't remember it ‘cause, ‘cause you're a bad son; because \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 170 – Recollection \n11 \nyou left her to rot in… (despondent) Wh-where did she go? She didn't like it, I \ndidn't like it. S-smelled. It smelled like… (sniffs) \nWhere am I? This isn't right I shouldn't be here; I should be— Somewhere, \nsomeone that— there are there are people who trust me, people who love me, \nso why can't I remember them? Why, why can't I see them? Sasha. Yeah! Yeah, \nyeah, I remember; there was, there was Sasha! I can see her face! No, no, wait, \nno; not, not Sasha, some, something else. The thing that isn't Sasha, that, that \ntook her, and, and made her something else, and her, her face, her, her face, I \ncan I can still see it, it's, laughing. Telling me that there's, there's nobody else. \nI'm alone. The only people who could ever stand to be around me are gone. \nEven from my mind. \n(Tearful) What is this place? So cold. And I can't see anything through all this \nfog. Huh, I must have left the window open. (stuttering) Let it, l-l-let the fog in. \nOh, my heating bills must be through the roof. Stupid! I can't afford that! At \nleast I've got a job now; did I tell you I've got a job? (normal) I mean, the \ninterview was weird, I, I don't really remember the man who talked to me. Just \nhis eyes. They stared at me, th-through me, and, and-and I knew that he knew \nwhat I had done. God I was, I was so scared, (more upbeat) but then he smiled, \nand shook my hand. What was his name? He said I ‘had the job,’ heh, that he \n‘looked forward to working with me’. I was still so scared (slight laugh) I could \nbarely move my arm. I was so terrified I'd let him down. \n[Hissing static starts] \nMARTIN (CONT'D) \nAnd then I met John, and I— (remembering) John, John! John! John? John, I'm \nhere! \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 170 – Recollection \n12 \n[Hissing static ends] \nMARTIN (CONT'D) \nJohn, I, I think I'm lost, I think, I don't— (whispered) John. \n[Chair creaks] \n(Beat) \n[Hissing static starts] \nMARTIN (CONT'D) \n(Pleasant) Oh, he-hello! Huh, what are you? \n[Hissing static ends] \nMARTIN (CONT'D) \nHuh. Didn't even know I had a tape recorder. Do you still work, or… \n[Tape recorder handling] \nMARTIN (CONT'D) \nHm, yeah, seems like you're running all right. \nHey, I should do some poetry! You could give it a little, little bit of that funky \nlo-fi goodness! All the cool poets love a bit of tape hiss, right? Maybe find \nsomewhere different to sit, though. \n[Chair scrapes on the floorboards] \nMARTIN (CONT'D) \nHate these chairs. Don't even know where I got them.
