Ocean sounds are audible \nthroughout.] \nARCHIVIST \nAny better? \nBASIRA \n(Nauseously) Not really. \nARCHIVIST \nYou were the one that suggested we go by boat. \nBASIRA \nDidn’t think I, urgh... (sniffs) I haven’t really done proper boats before. \nARCHIVIST \nHmm. Hold on. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 141 – Doomed Voyage \n[Footsteps ring on metal] \nExcuse me? \nSHIPHAND \nYeah? \nARCHIVIST \nDo you know when we’re scheduled to arrive? \nSHIPHAND \nCaptain reckons two days. \nARCHIVIST \nThank you. \n[Footsteps ring on metal] \nARCHIVIST \nHe says another two days. \nBASIRA \nYeah, I heard. Thanks. \nWhat? \nARCHIVIST \nThe tape recorder. \n[Sudden inhalation from Basira] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 141 – Doomed Voyage \nBASIRA \nGet ready. Any idea what’s coming? \nARCHIVIST \nN-No... No, I-I don’t think that’s it. \nBASIRA \nIt’s not recording for nothing. \nARCHIVIST \nNo, I… I think… \n(Calling out) Excuse me? \nSHIPHAND \nYeah? \n[Footsteps approach] \nARCHIVIST \n(Interestedly) You... \nSHIPHAND \nUh... \nBASIRA \nJohn? \nARCHIVIST \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 141 – Doomed Voyage \nYou used to work for Salesa. \nSHIPHAND \nWhat? You— -Who did? \nI don’t know what you’re talking about. \nARCHIVIST \nMikaele Salesa. You used to work on his ship. \nSHIPHAND \nI don’t know you. \nARCHIVIST \n(Archly) But I know you. \nBASIRA \nJohn... \nARCHIVIST \nFloyd Matharu. Served on the Dorian from 2011 to 2014. With Salesa. \nBASIRA \nJohn, I’m not sure about this. \nARCHIVIST \nI am. \nTell me what happened. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 141 – Doomed Voyage \nFLOYD \nWh-What is this? \nARCHIVIST \nWhenever you’re ready. \nFLOYD (STATEMENT) \nA-Alright. Sure. \nHe… H-He w-was a good boss, you know? I worked for him for three years, \nand… treated us well. He never lied to us about the sort of thing he was into. \nHe didn’t exactly volunteer specifics, but we all knew what we were doing \nwasn’t legal, and we trusted him because he knew what he was doing. \nIt was a weird ship to be on, though, and not just because everyone was \nalways gossiping about whatever the latest haunted cargo was. A lot of it was \nbecause we had a-a captain, a man named Gaultier, but he reported to Salesa. \nNormally, if the captain’s working for someone they’re going to be on the ship \nall the time; they’ll just be organising things, so there’s no worries about who’s \nin charge, you just obey the captain. But Salesa always travelled with us, \nkeeping an eye on whatever he was moving that day. It felt like… it felt like he \nwas a part of the crew, even though he didn’t actually have a job to do. Always \nfelt a bit uncomfortable when the captain was giving orders and he was there. I \ncould sometimes feel Captain Gaultier looking to him for support or \nconfirmation, and that always slightly undermined our confidence in him. It \nwasn’t a problem, not really, and Salesa never threw his weight around, never \ncontradicted the captain in front of", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 0, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 3163}}
