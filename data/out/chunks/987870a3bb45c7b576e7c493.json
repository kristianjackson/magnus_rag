The \nmedical staff appeared to have retreated to the large tent that served as their \nbase of operations, and if anyone noticed me, they didn’t interfere. I loaded \nthe gear into a wheelbarrow I had taken from the building site along with a \nthick metal chain, and began to head back towards the parkplatz, stopping \nonly to fill the syringe from a can of garden pesticide I had noticed during my \nearlier sweep of the houses. \nFinally, I revealed myself. He approached me coyly, clearly believing me to be a \nfoolish or lost ECDC medic. Perhaps he assumed I was frozen in terror at the \nsight of his work, and luckily my hazmat suit did much to hide my expression. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 157 – Rotten Core \nHe walked up to me with a smile so wide it tore the edges of his mouth, leaking \na sick green liquid from the edges, and reached a hand out for my mask. \nIt was then I gripped his hand and plunged the syringe into his spongy flesh \nand pumped him full of the chemical cocktail. He staggered back, ripping the \nneedle from my hand, and fell to the floor, shaking. \nI had no illusions of poison being sufficient to destroy an avatar of Filth, though \nfrom what I knew of his affinity to insects, I hoped it would be at least \ntemporarily effective. Regardless, I had to work fast. I dragged him to the \nstretcher and strapped him down, wrestling against his thrashing spasms. Even \nthrough the hazmat suit I could feel the diseased heat of his skin. \nI wrapped him around with the chain, which would, I hoped, hold him fast, as I \npulled the plastic over the stretcher in layer after layer until I could barely see \nhim through the thick clouded material. I hadn’t brought any of the supports \nwith me, so in the end, it looked less like the well-constructed tube of a \nquarantine stretcher, and more like a lumpy vinyl sack. Still, it was sealed, and \nthat was enough for my purposes. I dragged the thing over to the building site \nand, with the last of my strength, threw him into the hole that had been left. \nBy this point, the concrete truck I’d turned on earlier had been mixing for some \ntime, and it was a simple matter to open the pump and pour the contents of its \nhopper down on top of him. How much he had recovered by this time, I \ncouldn’t say for sure, but… he certainly moved around plenty as that thick gray \nsludge began to cover him. \nI can’t deny some pride in my solution, Gertrude. In all our discussions of how \nto contain a being that we could not destroy, I’m not sure we ever hit on a \nmethod quite so neat. I am no builder, but by the end I think you would have \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 157 – Rotten Core \nbeen hard-pressed to criticize how well that concrete had been laid, and \nAmherst four feet beneath it. \nAnd now, the part of my tale you must have anticipated from the beginning. \nDuring the altercation, the adrenaline had kept me from noticing the tear that \nAmherst had made in my hazmat suit while I wrestled him onto the stretcher, \nbut as I sat to savor my victory, it became clear that a great cut on my leg had \ngone clean through the material. There was no way that I was not infected, \nand indeed over these last few hours, I have felt the sickness working on me. \nMy pace is sluggish, and I can feel my skin begin to loosen. My heart is beating \nso fast it shakes my whole body. \nBut I shall not wait for it to putrefy as the rot overtakes me. I have dragged \nthose other afflicted I could find into the parkplatz, laid them at the feet of \nthat appalling throne, and taken the last gift of that generous construction site: \na dozen cans of petrol. I will sit upon that seat and release these poor souls \nfrom their suffering, and hopefully make things simpler for the ECDC cleanup \ncrews. \nBut it did not seem quite right to leave without letting you know what \nhappened, and Herr Becker was kind enough to succumb to the sickness \nwithout signing out of his computer. So. \nPerhaps you were right about the Extinction. I’ve been hunting it for decades \nnow, and while I have seen evidence of its influence in other powers, I have \nnever found anything to genuinely prove its emergence as a true power of its \nown. Perhaps it is an existential fear that flows through the others like a vein of \nore, or perhaps the birth of such things is longer and more complicated than I \nbelieved. For all that, though, I cannot regret at the time I have spent seeking", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 3, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 4454}}
