At first, I thought the \nbodies were all human, that perhaps I had somehow stumbled upon some sort \nof gang, disposing of a massacre’s worth of corpses. But then some of them \nstarted to move. Squirming limbs were dragging, rising, extracting themselves \nfrom this mound of flesh and making their way down to join their companions \non the ground, one by one. Most of them could still be mistaken for human at \na distance; a few even wore clothes. No-one said a word. \nAfter a minute or so, it looked like everything that was going to climb down off \nthe truck had done so. The pile of meat still rose several metres up from the \nback of the truck, and as much as I wanted to look away, I couldn't. Most of it \nwas just unidentifiable chunks, but a lot of it was clearly animal: chickens, \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 130 – Meat \n7 \n \nlambs … I even saw a whole pig head. Some of it was human. I could see a \nman’s torso near the top of the pile and an arm jutted out near the base, the \nhand splayed out at the end. I had the weirdest impulse to wave to it. The \ndriver, or the one I assume was the driver, then started to reach up onto the \npile. He took a handful of any meat he could reach and turned to whoever, or \nwhatever, was nearest to him. He passed it on to them, and then they would \nturn and head towards the back of the temple, towards an unmarked door I \nhad assumed was staff only. Now it was open, and they went in one at a time. \nThey didn’t come back out. \nAll this time, I had just been watching from my hiding spot, totally frozen in \nconfusion and fear. As I said, the temple stood apart from any other buildings, \nand if I tried to leave, the chances were high that I would be spotted. I thought \nI could maybe just wait, just stay where I was until these people had finished \ndoing whatever it was they were doing. Then they would drive away, and I \nwould leave and spend the rest of my life pretending I had never seen \nanything, that I had gone to an art gallery instead. \nThis plan lasted right up until the driver saw me. It was my own fault. My leg \nwas starting to cramp up, so I tried to shift position, but I didn’t realise just \nhow painful it would be to move, and I let out a cry before I had a chance to \nstifle it. The driver’s head snapped up and focused on me. He was rail thin, \ndressed in rough overalls, with shaggy black hair and pale skin. He was East \nAsian, Chinese, maybe, but he called me over in a crisp British accent. His tone \nwas firm, but unhurried, and to my ears, not immediately threatening. So, I did \nas he asked. I walked slowly but deliberately over to him, hands out to my side, \ndoing my best to show him I wasn’t a threat.
