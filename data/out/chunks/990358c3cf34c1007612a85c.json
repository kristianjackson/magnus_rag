I suppose that’s understandable. \n \nARCHIVIST \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG116 – The Show Must Go On \n \n2 \n \nWhat do you want? \n \nELIAS \nTo help. You have your recorder running? \n \nDAISY \nCourse he does. \n \nARCHIVIST \nI... Yes. \n \nELIAS \nWell, then I’ll speak clearly. You will soon be attempting to stop something few \nhave ever witnessed, and fewer still have survived. \n \nARCHIVIST \nNot alone. \n \nBASIRA \nWe’re, um, I think we’re all going. \n \nELIAS \nYes. And I believe your plan, simplistic as it may be, does have a reasonable \nchance of working. \n \nARCHIVIST \nWell thank you. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG116 – The Show Must Go On \n \n3 \n \n \nMARTIN \nSorry, sorry, did we— I thought we’d actually only got as far as, ah, well, we, \nwe sneak in, plant bombs when they’re distracted and then— \n \nARCHIVIST \nDetonate them when the ritual starts and they’re vulnerable. \n \nBASIRA \nI mean, I’ve got some plans of the museum and the area around it, but yeah, \nthat’s... that’s it. \n \nDAISY \nShould work. Doesn’t need to be fancy. \n \nELIAS \nWell, quite. But given there is every likelihood that some or all of you might \nend up confronting The Stranger in a rather direct manner, I thought it best \nyou have an idea of what you might encounter. \n \nMARTIN \nOh. \n \nELIAS \nDuring the... ‘difficulties’ with your initial absence, John, I took Gertrude’s \ntapes into my safe-keeping. \n \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG116 – The Show Must Go On \n \n4 \n \nARCHIVIST \nYes, I thought about as much. \n \nELIAS \nThere is one, I feel, it may be a wise for you to hear.

Statement taken from journal entry dated 2nd November \nof that year. Committed to tape 4th October 2013. Gertrude Robinson \nrecording. \n \nGERTRUDE (STATEMENT) \nSome months have passed now since the sights and sounds that excited in me \nthat unknown and hideous mania, yet still my hand shakes in the writing of it, \nsuch that I can scarce understand myself the marks I leave upon the page. I \nwould hold myself the most ill-used of men, were I not certain of others who \nleft that theatre with wounds far graver than a tremor. I curse the name of \nWolfgang von Kempelen and all his vile machinery, and there is no greater \nhope within me than that I should never again be required to lay eyes upon the \nMechanical Turk.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 0, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 2934}}
