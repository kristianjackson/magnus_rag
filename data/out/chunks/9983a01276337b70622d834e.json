Not without a 2013 copy of the Aberdeen \nYellow Pages. A bit of relief, in some ways. I tried to contact Mr. Davenport \nabout it, and did get through, but he told me to… um, he… he… wishes no \nfurther contact with the Institute. \nMelanie looked into Marie Balandin, though. In 2011 and 2012, she did really \nwell in several IFBB competitions, but it looks like she disappeared around the \ntime of this statement. No missing persons report was ever filed, but there’s \nno record of her anywhere after that. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG090 – Body Builder \n14 \n \nThe last official mention seems to be a police report filed on August 23rd, \n2013, which lists her as a ‘person of interest’ in a series of animal mutilations \non a farm about five miles west of Aberdeen. A bunch of sheep were found \ndead, with their femurs removed. Look, I, I know we’re not meant to speculate \nin these bits, but… well, I just… I wonder what she was planning to do with \nthem. \nThere. Well, that’s, er… That’s it. \n[Tape clicks off.] \n[The Magnus Archives Theme - Outro] \nThe Magnus Archives is a podcast distributed by Rusty Quill and licensed under \na creative commons attribution, non-commercial share alike 4.0 international \nlicense.
