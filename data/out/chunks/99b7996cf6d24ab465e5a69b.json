There were many things that happened, each strange \nand inexplicable in and of itself, but I’ll be damned if I can see how they \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG046 – Literary Heights \n2 \n \nconnect to each other, except that they all ended up involving the same \nstudent from the university. \nHis name was Michael Crew, though he normally went by Mike, at least to me. \nI’m not usually one to pay much attention to the students who come into my \nshop, especially during the start of a new school year. I have something of a \nsoft spot for the antique when it comes to my furnishings and that, combined \nwith the age of my stock, means that when new students arrive at the \nuniversity, they generally regard the discovery of Lion Street Books as \nsomething of a curiosity. I’ve heard more than one comparison to that shop in \nStephen King’s, ‘‘Needful Things’’, or whatever it was called. \nAnyway, as I deal mostly in rare books and antiquities, they generally get one \nlook of the prices and suddenly their interest dries up. Of course, there are \nalways a couple of rich kids whose parents weren’t able to buy their way into \nOxbridge, so it’s not a complete waste. \nSo, it’s rare that I have any cause to remember the face of my student \ncustomers, but Mike struck me the moment he walked into my shop. This \nwould have been last September – I don’t remember the exact date, though \nI’m sure if I looked up my receipts I could tell you. He was short, barely over \nfive feet, and very thin, underfed, I remember thinking. It hadn’t yet turned \ncold, but he wore a high collared coat and a thick scarf wrapped around his \nneck. \nNow I’m getting on in years and, much as I love my shop, the building can get a \nbit drafty come autumn, so I generally have the heating up quite high. It was \nclearly enough for him to become uncomfortable wrapped up like that and he \nremoved the scarf to reveal a branching pattern of white scar tissue arcing up \nthe side of his neck. That was interesting, certainly, but it wasn’t what actually", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 0, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 2980}}
