It dulled the pain, but the pain was never the \nproblem. Regardless, they always strapped the anaesthetic mask tight to her \nface before they began to cut. \n[Click of a metal tray, then visceral sounds of surgery] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nThe procedure varied depending on the diagnosis. An organ diagnosis was \nsimple: open her up, dig around inside her until they could remove something \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 182 – Wellbeing \n17 \nthat could conceivably be a liver or a pancreas or a (questioning) gallbladder? \nThen put something back in its place. Sometimes what they put in was hard \nand sharp, digging into her when she tried to move, sometimes it was soft and \nputrid, and she could feel it rotting away within. Occasionally it was alive, and \nshe could feel it clawing to get out. \n[An electric drill noise now joins the surgery sounds] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nWhen the diagnosis had been skin, they had been peeled her piece by piece \nbefore they painted the inside of it with something dark and sticky, then sewed \nit back on. All through she could do nothing but watch as they cut and \nswapped and conjectured her body, unable to speak, to move, to do anything \nbut watch these anonymous things play with everything she was. \nBut worse, perhaps, were the medicines. If they prescribed her medicine, she \ntried her best not to take it, but the pills would crawl down her throat when \nshe wasn’t paying attention, and the solutions would pour themselves in her \near when she lay down to rest. They might have done nothing, been naught \nbut dust and sugar, but she could never be sure. The sickness, the seizures, the \nspasms, the sadness. If it wasn’t the medicine, then it was inside her. And it \nhad always been inside her. And she just didn’t know. \n[One last loud and wet drilling occurs, before fading away] \n[Pause in SFX, then the sounds of short, pained breaths; ice-like \ncrackling; and huffing machinery] \nPatient: Kelly M. \nDate and place of birth: 1st April 1982, Bournemouth Hospital. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 182 – Wellbeing \n18 \nDate and place of last contentment: Not recalled. \nComplaint: Headaches. \nSurgical procedures thus far: 220. \nPrognosis: unwise. \nIn her locked and darkened room she waited for the doctors to come. She \nlooked to the small strip of fluorescence that spilled beneath the door, but \nnothing disturbed it. When would they come? When would they give her her \nnext treatment? \nThe last doctor had told her it was her heart. They had rushed her down to the \ntheatre, and tore open her chest with something that looked like a pastry \ncrimper and reached inside. Her bile rose at the memory of those strange \nboneless fingers brushing against her lungs. Then they had gripped something, \nand pulled it out of her slowly and… almost tenderly. Kelly remembered it had \nhad at first looked like a child, a baby, but it had her face, and stole away her \nsmile. She didn’t see what they did with it, but in its place they put a cold and \nglassy thing, a frozen tube that beats and pumps out ice water that makes her \nshiver all through the deepest parts of herself. \nIt still pumps now, as Kelly sits shivering in the corner of her room. \nHow long has it been? There is no way to tell, not here, but they will come \nback, they must come back. They always do. They must swap out this cold and \nhollow emptiness for some fresh pain and-and torture. She longs to feel the \npain, as it is at least a feeling. But the fear has grown inside her now. What if \nthe doctors have finished? What if she is treated, and this is all there is now? \nWhat if she is well? Kelly looks to the door and waits. \n[Tape clicks off]", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 4, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 3965}}
