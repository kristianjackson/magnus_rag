I don’t want to be alone. \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nVery well. Let’s start from the beginning. \n \nNAOMI \nAlright. I guess the beginning would be when I met Evan. I’ve never really been \nthe social type. I’ve always been more comfortable alone, you know? My \nfather died when I was 5 years old and my mother spent so much time working \nto keep us fed that I hardly ever saw her. I wasn’t bullied in school or anything \nlike that. I mean, to be bullied you need to be noticed and I made sure that I \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG013 – Alone \n5 \n \nwasn’t. It was the same in secondary school and even in uni up at Leeds. When \neveryone was moving out into shared houses for second year, I stayed in a nice \ncosy room for one in university accommodation. I’ve always just been happier \nalone. \nWell, maybe happier isn’t quite the right word. I did get a bit lonely sometimes. \nI’d hear laughter coming from other rooms in my building or see a group of \nfriends talking in the sun outside and maybe I’d wish I had something like that, \nbut it never really bothered me. I knew my own company and was comfortable \nwith it. I didn’t need other people and they certainly didn’t need me. The only \nperson who ever really seemed to worry about it was Pastor David. He worked \nin the Chaplaincy, and I saw him occasionally when work or stress was getting \nto me. My mum’s a Methodist, and I felt more comfortable talking to him that \nany of the secular counsellors. He used to tell me it wasn’t natural for people \nto live in isolation, that we were creatures of community by nature. I \nremember he always used to say that he was “worried I’d get lost”. Back then, \nI didn’t know what he meant. I think I do now, though. Anyway, the point is \nthat when I graduated three years ago, I left Leeds with a first in Chemistry and \nno real friends to speak of. And that was fine by me. \nI got a job as a science technician down in Woking. It didn’t pay well, and the \nchildren were a thick, entitled lot, but it was enough to live on and kept me \nclose enough to London that I could apply for the various lab jobs that I \nactually wanted. It was interviewing for one of these where I met Evan. He was \ngoing for the same position as I was – lab assistant in one of the UCL \nBiochemistry departments. He got the job, in the end, but I didn’t care. He was \nso unlike anyone I’d ever met before. He started talking to me before the \ninterview, and I amazed myself by actually talking back. When he asked me \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG013 – Alone \n6 \n \nquestions, I didn’t feel uneasy or worried about my answers, I just found \nmyself telling this stranger all about myself, without any self-consciousness at \nall. When he was called in for his interview, I actually felt a pang of loss like \nnothing I’d known before. All for a stranger who I’d met barely ten minutes \nago. When I came out of the building after my own, somewhat disastrous, \ninterview and saw him standing there waiting for me... I don’t think I’ve ever \nbeen happier than in that moment. \nWe went out, and dating gradually turned into living together. I’d had two \nboyfriends in the past – both short-lived relationships that ended abruptly. In \nboth cases they said it was because they never really felt like I wanted them \naround and, looking back, that was kind of true. With Evan it was different. It \nnever seemed like his being there stopped me being myself or crossed into \nspaces that I saw as my own. Everything about being with him felt so natural \nthat when he told me he loved me, it only came as a surprise to realise that we \nhadn’t said it already. He had friends, as well, plenty of friends, how could he \nnot? And he would take me out to meet them when I wanted to, and when I \ndidn’t he let me be. After a year with him I actually had what could perhaps be \ncalled a social life and, more than that, I didn’t hate it. I always used to roll my \neyes at people who said that their loved ones ‘completed them’, but I honestly \ncan’t think of any other way to describe how it felt to be with Evan. I proposed \nto him after only two years, and he said yes. \nI’ll skip over the bit where he dies. It’s only been a year, and I don’t want to \nspend an hour crying into your crappy tape player.
