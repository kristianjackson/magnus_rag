Still, about as much as I might have \nexpected, so I headed back to the Institute and updated you on what I’d found. \nAnd, well, as I'm sure you're aware that was the last time I saw you before I \ndisappeared. \nI was heading home when I got to thinking, and I was worried I hadn't really \ndone enough investigation for you, since I got so freaked out by the basement \nand all. And then I remembered that I'd seen quite a lot of spider webs in the \nbrief time I was down there, and maybe I should check it out again. I mean, like \nI said, I'm not really afraid of spiders. So… I went back for another look. It was \ndark when I got to Boothby Road, but I saw that the basement window was still \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG022 – Colony \n6 \n \nopen. I'd made sure to bring a torch this time, and after a quick check to make \nsure nobody was watching, I climbed inside. I knew right then that I'd made a \nhuge… mistake. The air was just as musty as it had been before, but it seemed \nwarmer than it had been, which was strange because outside it was a cold \nFebruary night. I turned on my torch and shone it around, but was \ndisappointed to see that all those spider webs that I remembered seemed old \nand unremarkable. If there were spiders there, none were easily seen, and… \nfor a second I thought that the only interesting part of my return trip was that \nit would land me in prison if I wasn't careful. Then, I heard movement. From \nthe other side of the basement. It was… faint, just a rustling, really. I didn't \nwant to check it out, I really didn't. I've catalogued and looked into enough of \nthese cases to know that following the noise is always a really, really bad idea, \nbut... I mean… it's my job, isn't it? \nSo, I slowly moved towards it, keeping my torch held in front of me like a… like \na shield. The beam was so much weaker than I had thought it was, and it only \nlit up the stark outlines of the shelves and detritus that littered the basement. \nThe movement had stopped, or at least I couldn't hear it anymore, and I’d \nalmost made up my mind to just turn around and leave, when my torch fell \nacross what looked like a human figure. It appeared to be… a woman. She was \nfacing away from me, apparently staring at the corner of the wall. Her hair was \nlong and black, though it was so twisted and dirty it was hard to tell if that was \nits original colour. She wore a threadbare grey overcoat, though beneath it her \nlegs were bare, and covered with what I at first I thought were spots. In her \nright hand she held a stained, green handkerchief. She stood there, totally still, \neither not noticing the torchlight that was shining on her, or not caring. \nI didn't move a muscle. Then, with a quick, jerky movement she brought the \nhandkerchief to her face and coughed. I mean, I call it a cough, because that's", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 3, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 2834}}
