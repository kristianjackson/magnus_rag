I sent \nTim to check the details – Martin declined to help with this investigation as \nhe's \"a bit claustrophobic\" – and he found some more bizarre discrepancies. \nMs. Popham was not found above ground, as she claimed. She was found a \nfew yards from the bottom of Death’s Head Hole, unresponsive and kneeling \nnext to a small pile of burned out candles. Alistair Popham claims not to have \nseen any such things being packed. She only came out of this stupor when \nbrought above ground, at which point she started shouting about her sister \nAlena, demanding they go and \"save her\". \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG015 – Lost John’s Cave \n12 \n \nThere is also the matter of the recording. She does not mention it in her \nstatement at all, but Ms. Popham took a camera with her into the cave system. \nIt was never claimed back from the CRO after her rescue, and Tim managed to \ngain enough access to copy the footage. Best not to ask how, I think. Most of it \nis mundane footage of Ms. Popham and her sister cave climbing, which \nseemed to match her statement, but the last recording is… somewhat \nalarming. The timestamp puts it at just past two o'clock in the morning of June \n15th. It is completely black, though whether this is because it was in a pitch \ndark cave or simply because the lens cap was still on is unclear. The audio is \nwhat concerns me, and here I will play a sample: \n[Underground Water Splashing] \nLAURA POPHAM \n(Increasing to crescendo) Take her not me, take her not me, take her not me, \ntake her not me. \n \nRecording Ends. \n[The Magnus Archives Theme - Outro] \n \nThe Magnus Archives is a podcast distributed by Rusty Quill and licensed under \na creative commons attribution, non-commercial share alike 4.0 international \nlicense.
