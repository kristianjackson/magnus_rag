Big surprise. But she did kinda hold up her end. \nARCHIVIST \nHuh. \nMARTIN \nI could’ve done without all the webbing, though. Still sticky. Urgh. \n[Martin rubs some webbing remnants off him] \nARCHIVIST \nWell, it’s over now and you’re safe, that’s all that matters. \nMARTIN \nNot quite... \nBASIRA \nMm-hmm. We do have another option to consider. \nARCHIVIST \nWhen we get back. I want to hear what the others have to say about it. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 198 – Precipice \n8 \nMARTIN \nThen we should get going. \nAh, speaking of? Um… Huh, where exactly do we go now? \nARCHIVIST \nForward. \nMARTIN \nUh, th-that’s a cliff, John. \nARCHIVIST \n(Sighs) Over there. \nBASIRA \nOh great. \nMARTIN \nW— S-ser-seriously? What happened to the big lake or whatever Basira was \ntalking about? I was looking forward to the lake! I-I’m-I’m fine rowing. I’m \ngood at rowing! \nARCHIVIST \nI’m sorry, some routes are one-way. \nMARTIN \n(Mildly distressed) So, so what, this is our new path then? Some rickety ladder \non a cliff edge that’s so high you can’t even see the bottom? Really? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 198 – Precipice \n9 \nARCHIVIST \nI admit it’s not a subtle metaphor. \n(Basira chuckles) \nMARTIN \n(Whispers) God… \n(Sullen) Yeah I get it. I don’t need another lesson on nightmare geography. It \nwas obvious as soon as I said it out loud. \nARCHIVIST \nIf there was another way... \nMARTIN \n(Sullen) Yeah, but there never is. Urgh, fine. Come on. \n[The start walking] \n[Tape clicks off] \n[Tape clicks on] \n[A blustering wind, with metal creaks and groans and every so \noften the sound of dirt falling] \n[Footsteps on metal as they descend the ladder] \nMARTIN \n(To himself) Okay... Easy does it. \nOne at a time. One at a time. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 198 – Precipice \n10 \nBASIRA \nCareful of your next one Martin! It’s loose. \nMARTIN \nHmm. \nRight! Thank you! \nBrilliant. \n[Careful footstep, then metal creaks and the rung gives way with a \nclatter and shower of dirt] \n[Martin exclaims in shock as he regains his footing] \nARCHIVIST \nMartin! Martin, are you alright? \nMARTIN \n(Mildly panicked) Mm-hmm! \nBASIRA \n(Gentle) I did warn you. \nMARTIN \nMm-hmm! \nBASIRA \nAre you good to keep going? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 198 – Precipice \n11 \nMARTIN \n…Yeah, just… just... Yeah. \nARCHIVIST \nMartin, would it help to know that if you do fall, you’ll be okay? \nMARTIN \n(Suspicious) Define “okay”. \nARCHIVIST \nI, uh— You wouldn’t die. \nMARTIN \nYeah, but it would still hurt, wouldn’t it? \nARCHIVIST \nUh, yes. \nBut not as much as th— \nMARTIN \nAnd, crucially, it would still feel like I’m falling an incredible distance. Wouldn’t \nit? \nARCHIVIST \nI mean, you would still be falling an incredible distance. \nYou just wouldn’t die when you hit the bottom. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 198 – Precipice \n12 \nMARTIN \nYeah, and there it is. \nBASIRA \nOh I have missed your pep-talks. \nARCHIVIST \nI’m afraid, it’s the best I can manage. \nMARTIN \nYeah, well, thanks for trying. \nBASIRA \nCan we just keep going? \nARCHIVIST \nRight. \n[Footsteps as they start descending again for a few beats] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nAh. \nBASIRA \nWhat? \nARCHIVIST \nRight. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 198 – Precipice \n13 \nBASIRA \n“Right”, what? \nMARTIN \nGuys, what’s going on down there? \n[They stop descending] \nARCHIVIST \nThe, uh... The ladder ends. \nMARTIN \nWhat do you mean it ends? \nBASIRA \nI’m guessing you’re not talking about the ground. \nARCHIVIST \nNo. No ground. And... no more ladder. \nMARTIN \nSo what do we do? \nBASIRA \nWhat do you think? We jump. And we fall. \n(Martin chuckles in disbelief)", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 1, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 3815}}
