My father wheeled round the corner \nand shouted a greeting as though everything was perfectly normal. He moved \nup beside the plump old woman standing in the doorway and looked at me, \nsmiling. The image made me feel queasy. I’m not even sure why, at this point I \nhad no reason to think this person was anything other than a friend of my \nparents, but something wasn’t right. \nI asked where my mother was, and they both got very quiet. I repeated the \nquestion with more force, and my father looked up to this strange woman in \nconfusion. She smiled sadly and stepped towards me, opening her arms as if to \nhug me, but I yelled at her to get back, demanding to see my mother. My \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG077 – The Kind Mother \n5 \n \nfather’s face grew dark, and he told me that my joke wasn’t funny. With the \nmost force I’d ever heard from him, he told me that however angry I was, this \nwasn’t the right way to deal with it. I looked back at this woman, standing \nthere with open arms, and she smiled at me. \n“Come, give your mother a hug,” she said. \nThe hour or two after that are a bit of a blur. I have vague memories of being \nnumbly taken through into the living room, sat on the sofa and handed a cup \nof tea. I tried to drink it as they talked on at me, but it was ice cold, so I must \nhave been sitting there a long time. I nodded once or twice, I think. My dad \nclearly thought I was having some sort of breakdown, and was just talking \nabout whatever came into his head in the hopes of calming me down. The \nwoman who was not my mother just talked cheerily, as though there was \nnothing at all amiss. \nShe had a kind voice, and her words were warm and friendly. She was nothing \nlike my mother, and I was very quickly becoming deeply afraid. Had she done \nsomething to my real mother, and somehow convinced my father she was her? \nIt seemed a ridiculous thought. My father may have been disabled but his mind \nwas still sharp, and he’d never showed any signs of the sort of dementia that \nwould let a stranger pose as his wife. Was he her prisoner? Maybe, but he \ndidn’t seem to be acting as though nything was wrong, and if that was the case \nwhy bother trying to convince me of so obvious a lie? \nI excused myself, and moved quickly out towards the back garden. Neither of \nthem made a move to stop me. I saw a phone near the back porch and \ngrabbed it, intending to call the police, when something caught my eye. It was \na series of photographs on the wall, showing our family in happier times. It had \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG077 – The Kind Mother \n6 \n \nbeen there for as long as I’d been to the house, and likely a lot longer. I had \nspent a long time staring at it my first visit there, lost in pleasant nostalgia, \nremembering days at the beach or the trip we took to Hanover when I was \neight. But now, in every one of them there stood this new woman where my \nmother should have been. She looked younger in these pictures, just like my \nfather, and across the dozen pictures on the wall I could see a timeline of this \nwoman growing old alongside him. \nThere was no way these photos could have been staged, and I could even see a \nsmall crease on the bottom corner of the Hanover picture. I remembered I’d \nsat on the pictures by accident on the journey home, bending the corner out of \nplace. I’d got a nasty talking to after that, and certainly not from the kindly \nfraud currently putting the kettle on in the kitchen. \nIt didn’t make any sense. It still doesn’t make any sense. After dinner I insisted \nthat we get out the photo albums, spouting some nonsense about catching up \non memories. My father and the woman who was not my mother agreed \nreadily enough, and so out came the albums and I began to look through them. \nI must have looked at well over five hundred photographs that evening, and \nnot a single one was out of place or failed to feature this stranger where my \nmother should have been. As my turning of the pages became more and more \nfrantic, I spotted a look on the face of this new mother. It was amused, almost \nmocking, and I became sure that she knew. Whoever this woman that called \nherself Rose Cooper was, she knew it was a lie as much as I did, and my \nconfusion and fear delighted her. \nFor all that, though, I was at a complete loss to explain any of it. Every piece of \nphotographic evidence I can find supported this woman’s claim to be my \nmother. My father’s memories agree", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 2, "chunk_count": 5, "chars": 4499}}
