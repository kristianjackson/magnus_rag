It’s not that I’m forgetful or stupid, you understand, just that I’m not very \ngood at spotting things that are out of place. The mind has a way of filling in \nthings it’s not concentrating on; just wallpapering them over with what you \nexpect to see. I rather think that part of my brain is more powerful than in \nmost people. I’ll never notice if you got a new haircut or piercing, and it’s a bit \nof a gamble whether I notice when you’ve had a baby. \nYou’d think that’d get in the way of being a plumber, but it really hasn’t, to be \nhonest. The thing you’ve got to remember is, if I know what I need to focus on \nI spot things just fine. And plumbing’s great for that – depending on the \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG087 – The Uncanny Valley \n4 \n \nproblem, there’s always the things I know need checking, one after the other, \nuntil one of them doesn’t look right. Then the fix is usually simple enough. \nThere’s no need to look at the thing as a whole, or pinpoint changes or \noddities. \nSo, even now, thinking back, it’s hard to say if there was anything particularly \nstrange about the call as it came in. Saying that I didn’t notice anything out of \nthe ordinary doesn’t really mean anything in that context. I suppose that the \nlocation they gave me was a bit of a surprise. I run my business out of \nPenmachno, out in Gwydir Forest, and it’s not exactly a densely populated \narea. I service people all over the region, and I wasn’t aware of any village or \nbuildings out in the area of the woods the caller directed me to. I mean, they \nhad co-ordinates on GPS, as there were no street names that they could give \nfor reference. It was an area I did sometimes drive though, and I didn’t \nremember anything being there, but I also didn’t really think about it at the \ntime. I suppose I reasoned that maybe there were some houses out there and, \nwell, I hadn’t noticed. \nThe problem sounded like a simple enough blockage, so I packed up my van, \nand started the journey over. It shouldn’t have taken nearly as long as it did, \nbut the roads aren’t all that easy to navigate at night, even with your satnav \ndoing its best, and especially when heading towards somewhere you’re not \nfamiliar with, trying to find the right road to get into some hidden valley or \nother. The call must have come in about seven thirty, as I’d just finished my \ndinner. I don’t normally do night callouts, but something about it had seemed \nurgent, and they had agreed to double my standard rate. \nI pulled up to a small collection of ramshackle looking buildings, made of wood \nand corrugated sheet metal, all set up around a large central building, that \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG087 – The Uncanny Valley \n5 \n \nseemed like some sort of workshop or small factory. At first I thought it might \nhave been a logging facility, but we were only a few miles from Penmachno, so \nif there were trees being chopped down here, I’d have known about it. \nProbably. I mean, even I’d be hard-pressed to miss the sound of industrial \nchainsaws. \nI pulled off the side of what seemed like a makeshift car park and got out. \nSomebody came over to meet me. Megan, she said her name was, and that \nwe’d spoken on the phone. She was very still when she said this, and seemed \nto be waiting for me to respond, so I grabbed my tools, and told her to show \nme to the plughole. She seemed a bit taken aback by this, so I apologised, \nassuming I’d been a bit too crude for her, and I asked her where I could find \nthe problem drain. \nShe led me up to the big building, gripped the door, and flung it open wide. \nThere was a damp, metallic smell that came from inside. Probably from the \nbacked up drain, I thought, although I will admit it didn’t smell much like \nanything I’d encountered before. Megan was stood in the doorway, arms \nspread wide for some reason, but to be honest I’d been checking my tools, and \nhadn’t really seen what she was doing. I asked her again to take me to the \ndrain, and she made a rather odd noise, and led me inside. \nWe walked through the main floor of the workshop, with people bustling \nabout either side, doing whatever it was they were doing. My mind was \nfocused on the job at hand. Megan took me into a back room full of pipes and \ngratings, and pointed to a drain in the centre of the floor where dark water \nwas pooling out of the top. You’d have thought the dark red would have clued \nme in to what was happening but, honestly, there are all sorts of industrial", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 1, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 4472}}
