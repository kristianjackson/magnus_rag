His left hand went to the boiling stock, blistering and peeling as Cook \nreached in and pulled out one of the larger bones, swinging it wildly about the \nplace. I don’t speak any Croatian, but given the way he was salivating I’m \npretty sure he chanting something about dinner. \nBut in the end, he only had one arm, and wasn’t thinking properly. His \nmovements were clumsy, like a drunk, and even at his best I’ve killed worse \nthan Cook. He went down easy. That’s another good thing about having a crew \nyou can trust. They tossed him overboard, and cleaned up without asking any \nsort of prying questions. Of course they belly-ached about another week on \n\ncanned food, but I think they understood the alternative would have been \nworse. \nStory has a happy ending, though. I managed to sell the grinder to some rich \nCanadian gourmet, who I assume was bored of the standard options for his \nmeals. Didn’t even have to leave anything out. Of course he disappeared about \na year later, and they never found the body. But there’s no way to prove that \nhad anything to do with me. Besides, it’s not like he was paying me in \ninstalments. \nARCHIVIST \nStatements ends. \n(Sigh) I suppose in some ways it’s strange I’m not a vegetarian yet, what with \neverything I know. But… I rather think someone in my position has to take their \nsmall pleasures where they can, and if it occasionally delights some grotesque \nmeat-god, well... c’est la vie. \nSo Salesa was one of Leitner’s old assistants. That makes some sense, I \nsuppose. The sort of small revelation that a month ago would have filled me \nwith wild conjecture. Now it seems, I don’t know, almost trite. Filling in the \npuzzle, but not touching on those parts of the picture I still don’t understand. \nMaybe it’s not that. Maybe it’s just this… stillness, the anticipation. I— We \nknow what’s happening, we know what we have to do about it, we even have \nsomething approaching a plan for once. And while it’s a welcome change not \nto be desperately praying for a deus ex machina, I don’t really know how to \nhandle the waiting. Whatever Elias has Daisy doing, it seems to be working. \nNothing’s made a move on me or the Institute since I returned, and last time I \n\nsaw her there was the distinct smell of burnt plastic. So I suppose I’m safe. But \neverything just feels like… killing time, running down the clock. I don’t think I \nlike it. \nGod, do I— do I miss being chased? That’s depressing. No, it’s… I just miss \nfeeling like I’m moving, like I— \n[There’s a knock on a door.] \n(Calls) Come i— \n[There’s another knock on the door.] \n(More sombrely) Come in. \n[A door creaks open] \n(Sharply) What do you want? \nHELEN \nNot sure. To talk. \nARCHIVIST \nYou're keeping her face, then. \nHELEN \nI am Helen. \nARCHIVIST \nDon’t pretend to be people I know. Knew. \nHELEN \n\nI’m not pretending. \nARCHIVIST \nYou’re not Helen Richardson. \nHELEN \nI wasn't Michael, either. \nARCHIVIST \nWho do you see? When you, you look at yourself? There are mirrors in those \ncorridors of yours. What do you see? \nHELEN \nI don’t. \nARCHIVIST \nWhy are you here? \nHELEN \nI… I’m not… I’m not entirely sure. I’m... having trouble. I don’t think I was \nmeant to be Helen. \nARCHIVIST \nI’m— I don’t understand. \nHELEN \nNeither do I. Michael was... pulling away. His anger was interfering. I don’t, I \ndon’t think I have a choice but to be Helen. Self is difficult. \n\nARCHIVIST \nMichael, he, uh, he, he wasn’t meant to be you either, though, was he? \nHELEN \nNo. \nARCHIVIST \nSo... (Slowly) Why are you here? \nHELEN \nI took someone. \nARCHIVIST \nYou t— Wh... L-Like Michael ate you? \nHELEN \nI took a man, wandering the halls of an old tenement. He's dead now, he never \neven came close to finding me. It was nourishing, but… \nARCHIVIST \nBut... \nHELEN \nI didn't like it. \nARCHIVIST \nYou d— (Sigh) I'm not sure I follow. \n\nHELEN \nI feel... wrong. I feel this— \nARCHIVIST \n(Angry) Why are you telling me this?! \nHELEN \nSomething happened when I became ‘Helen’. She wasn't right, she wasn't \nready. \nARCHIVIST \nI don't... \nHELEN \nBefore, talking to you made Helen feel better. \nARCHIVIST \nYou're not that Helen! \nHELEN \nI just want... I just want to feel better. \nARCHIVIST \nI don't believe you. \nHELEN \nYou don't?", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 3, "chunk_count": 5, "chars": 4270}}
