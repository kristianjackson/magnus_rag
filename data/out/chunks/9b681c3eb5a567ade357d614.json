Every dizzy spell was a sign of MS; every achy leg was \na fatal blood clot. She never feared an epidemic or a plague, and the thought \nof infection rarely troubled her, because she knew that whatever was about to \nimminently kill her was going to rise up from deep inside her own body. \nFor her whole life, as each milestone of adulthood passed, Danika never \nbelieved that she would live more than two years further. Every relationship \nwas tinged with a melancholic guilt that she would leave them so soon. Every \nachievement overshadowed by the certainty she wouldn't be around to enjoy \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 168 – Roots \n13 \nit for very much longer. Real health problems — her acid reflux, her blood \npressure — were ignored, because, well. They wouldn't matter for much \nlonger, would they? \nWhen the change came and the fears oozed forth into our world, the End that \nlaces through every fibre of my soul reached out and gave Danika to me. She \nhad fed it well for so long; it was only right that she should be here. \nFour: Circumstances of the death. \nIn exactly thirteen stretches of the route on which Danika travels — a stretch \nbeing measured in the waves of nauseating terror that flow out of her with \nsuch rhythmic regularity — she will finally arrive at her destination. It will be a \ncrowded place, a shopping mall or somewhere similar, though her feet will \nnever leave the route that binds her. She will feel it first as a dull ache, a \nsensation not unlike being pinched, but in the inside of her leg. Her skin will \nprickle like a faint and shuddering electric current were passing through it, and \nshe will absentmindedly scratch at it, as though it were a simple itch that could \nbe dismissed. \nShe will know exactly what is happening, but after so many scares and false \nalarms and dismal, morbid obsessions, she will not feel comfortable enough to \nsound any alarm or ask for anyone's help. She will simply stagger over to a \nbench that is nearby and find herself a seat to try and wait out whatever \nunpleasant sensations are washing over her, even though she is certain it will \nnever leave her. It is, alas, the act of sitting down that dislodges the long-\nforeseen blood clot in her leg, formed when she took that long-distance coach \ntrip. She should have known with her dreadful circulation that cramming \nherself into so little leg room would be the end of her, but she had dismissed \nsuch thoughts, waving them away as more paranoia. But the End knows there \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 168 – Roots \n14 \nis no paranoia about your own demise. Only that dim, plodding awareness of \nits constant approach. \nThe clot, now broken, will travel up and through her. Danika will feel its \npassage all through her body, aware of it as every vein of the corpse roots is \naware of her and those just like her, walking along their all-too-brief span. She \nwill begin to cough as it hits her lungs, her anxious dread and sense of doom \nbubbling up to fever pitch as the pink mucus bubbles up through her lips. She \nclutches her chest, as if desperate to pull the knotted blood vessels out with \nher bare hands, and looks wildly about. But the crowds that were there such a \nshort time ago have vanished, and there is nobody to help her. Nobody to see \nher collapse and call an ambulance. It is too late. It has always been too late. \nDanika Gelsthorpe will try one last time to stand, and instead collapse into a \ncorner, mostly obscured by a large pot plant, and will not be discovered for \nalmost half an hour, by which time any hope of saving her has long since \npassed. She remains conscious for several minutes after she falls, unable to \nmove or speak or even think in any recognizable sense, but aware enough of \nwhat is happening to be grasped with the despair of a terror realised. \nAnd then, at last, she dies. Her last thoughts a certainty of the yawning well of \nnothingness that awaits her as consciousness slips away. Danika takes another \nstep along the corpse root. \nFive: Coroner's concerns. \nI watch, as with each motion, each laboured, reluctant movement along her \npath, Danika Gelsthorpe is painfully and inescapably aware of what it is that \nlies at the end of it. She tries to move backwards, off to the side, any direction \nother than that unstoppable, inescapable forwards.
