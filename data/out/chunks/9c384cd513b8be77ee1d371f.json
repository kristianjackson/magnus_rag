If that’s… yeah. \n[Door opens & closes] \n(Martin sighs.) \n[Tape clicks off. Tape clicks on.] \nTIM \n(Wearily) Mr. Smith… \nSMITH \n(Angry) Look, Jeremy, is somewhere, under London, right now, having… \nbioweapons tested on him! Yeah! Like, and I know that, 100% certain, coz it’s a \nfact! \nTIM \nI think you might possibly be looking for a different agency… \nSMITH \nWell, I, I think so! I came here, because I have uncovered, like, a massive \ngovernment conspiracy, yeah. And what are you doing? You’re like… you’re \nwhat? Just frowning at me sceptically. \nTIM \nIt’s possible you should take that to someone else, Mr. Smith. \n\nSMITH \nWell! Well probably! Probably I should do that! Coz that’s a fat lot of use you \nare! Mendacists! \nYou’re rubbish! \n(Tim sighs) \nTIM \nStatement ends. \n[Tape clicks off. Tape clicks on.] \nROBIN \nYeah, people have always said to me that Jack Russells can be difficult dogs, \nbut I’ve always found that, that, as long as you, sort of, treat them right, and, \nyou know, give them lots of treats, and it’s, it’s really quite— \nBASIRA \n(Getting exasperated) So you were in the spiral, and you heard an old man \ncrying? \nROBIN \nAs I was meandering around, and you know when you hear, you, you hear \nsomeone crying, but you, you, but you definitely sort of say that’s, that’s… \nthat’s, there’s an age in that voice. Like it sounded… like, if you, have you heard \nmany old men crying? \nBASIRA \n\n(Sharply interjects) So you were following…? \nROBIN \nYes, that’s right. So, you know how, sort of, at places like Hampton Court, \nwhere they’ve got those little hedge mazes, and rather than, sort of, bounding \nstraight into the middle of them, where you can just sort of walk over all the \nhedges, you have to, you have to, sort of, follow it through, er, I’ve, it sort of \nput in me in mind of that. As, er, as I sort of imagine myself in… exploring that \nmaze— \nBASIRA \nSo you followed the maze? \nROBIN \nSo I followed the, so I, yeah, so I followed the spiral, the spiral round and, er, I \ncould definitely hear this sort of old man crying.

Er, he was, he was— \nBASIRA \nMmmm, so… So what happened? \nROBIN \nSo, so… as I was going round, and, and hearing this old man, erm, I suddenly, \nsuddenly realised that I was going to be late for… I was going to be late for my \nmum’s dinner that she had planned, er— \nBASIRA \n\nYou… But… didn’t you say it was, it was about noon? \nROBIN \nWell, that was the funny thing.

So, er, at that point, I, I left. \nBASIRA \n…I’m sorry? \nROBIN \nYes, so I would, I would have been late for dinner, so… \nBASIRA \nSo you left? \nROBIN \nSo I got out of the spiral, and went to dinner. \nBASIRA \n… (Baffled vocalisations) \nStatement ends… I suppose. \n\nROBIN \nIs, is, is that all you need from me? \nBASIRA \n(Emphatically) Yep. \nROBIN \nAre you sure? \nBASIRA \nYep! \nROBIN \nYou don’t, you don’t need anything— \nBASIRA \nAbsolutely! \nROBIN \nYou want any more details— \nBASIRA \nNope! Thank you Mr. Lennox. \nROBIN \nOkay. \n[Tape clicks off. Tape clicks on.] \n\nBRIAN \n(Very distressed) …and I just, I dunno what to do anymore! I think they were \nfollowing me. I think they followed me here! I saw a spider in the basement \noutside. And, and the webbing, it just… it had this webbing, the sticky kind… \nand I just… I don’t know how I can keep… I just need… This is the first time I’ve \nbeen in a room where I haven’t seen a spider— \nMELANIE (Overlapping) \nI… Please, just… There’s, there’s tea there.
