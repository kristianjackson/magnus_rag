If I had glanced over a \nsecond later or only caught it from the corner of my eye, I could easily have \ndismissed it. After all, the simple presence of insects is not, in and of itself, \nremarkable. It was the where this particular insect came from, however, that \nshook me so deeply. Benoît was leaning over the bar, listening to a young man \nwho, I believe, was ordering for quite a large group. As this customer listed off \nhis drinks, Benoît’s hand rested lightly upon the countertop, and I found, for no \nreason I could readily provide, my gaze was resting upon the fingers of his \nhand. \n\nWithout any warning, or reaction from Benoît himself, there seemed to be \nmovement from the ring finger of his right hand. A slight shudder, a shifting of \nthe skin beneath his fingernail. A small patch of darkness seemed to grow just \nbelow it, expanding until it resolved itself into the shape of an insect. It pushed \nitself smoothly and quickly out from below his fingernail and dropped down \nonto the bar, scuttling away and out of sight so quickly I lost it almost \nimmediately. It had all happened in a matter of moments, and there was no \nblood, no reaction from Benoît, no evidence that it had truly happened at all, \napart from my shaking legs and the feeling I was going to collapse. And it was \nin that state that your associate found me. \nAt the time I thought he was your son. His French was significantly better than \nyours, and it took some time and some difficulty translating before I could fully \nexplain to you what had happened. You rebuffed all my questions about your \ninterest in Benoît and his situation, as you resolutely have since. I am… telling \nyou my story, since you have asked so nicely, but I will never truly forgive \neither of you for what you have shown me. I should have been more suspicious \nof this man, too old for his poorly dyed hair, leading me to an old woman who \npromised me answers in exchange for an address. I should have walked away. I \nshouldn’t have offered to go with you. But I was in shock from what I had seen, \nand I believe you could have told me to do almost anything, and I would have \nbeen unlikely to argue. You tried to cross-examine me about things I didn’t \nunderstand: “Étranger ou la saleté?” I honestly had no idea what you were \ntalking about, but I didn’t put up a fight when you told me to get Benoît’s \naddress. I don’t know why you agreed when I asked to come with you. I wish \nyou hadn’t. \n\nDo you really need me to describe it? You saw it for yourselves. The flowing \ntide that swarmed and scuttled as soon as the door opened. The smell that \nrolled out of that apartment like a choking wall. The thing that embraced \nBenoît. Mon petit scarabée. The only thing I don’t know is if you saw in as \nmuch detail as I did the look of sheer contentment and joy on poor Benoît’s \nface as his family crawled all over him. I don’t care about what the police might \nhave done; your young colleague was right. You should have burned the place \nto the ground. I have nothing more to say to you. \nARCHIVIST \nStatement ends. \nTh— (Sighs) This is, um… \n[Pages turning.] \nThis is written in French. A-All of it. I don’t… I don’t speak French. I-I don’t \nread… I’ve never… \n(Sigh) I wish I could find it in myself to be surprised. \n[More pages turning] \nEr, statement, it seems, given directly to Gertrude. Though not apparently \nrecorded. Did she perhaps leave her tape recorder at home when she took this \nlittle ‘field trip’ with Gerard? June 2014. Barely a year before her murder, and \nless than half that before Gerard Keay’s brain tumour would lead to his own \ndeath. Did he know already? That his life was ending? Was he trying to \naccomplish one last good deed before the end? Were they both? “Étranger ou \nla saleté?” Foreigner or dirt. Stranger or Filth.
