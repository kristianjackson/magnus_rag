He insisted that he’d never \nmake such a rookie move. I told him that he could argue with me, but not with \nthe camera. Eventually he stormed off to ‘go exploring’ further on. I took \nanother picture before I followed him. The shadow was still there, and it \nseemed to be ever so slightly closer. \nI don’t know why I ignored it. The human mind is amazingly adept at ignoring \nthings that don’t make sense, that it doesn’t want to see. I convinced myself it \nwas a quirk of the angles at that location. I didn’t even let myself entertain the \nthought that it could be a problem with my extremely expensive camera, so I \ndefinitely didn’t consider the possibility of a supernatural explanation. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 063 – The End of the Tunnel \n \n6 \n \n \nI followed Luke further on until, after about 20 minutes, we came to the ruins \nof a chamber of some sort. The roof had collapsed, probably from the bombing \nthat had destroyed St James’ church, and the rubble blocked off most of it. It \nlooked like it had once been a circular room and on either side of the entrance \nI could see doorways blocked with fallen stone. There was no way we’d be able \nto shift enough debris to access them, but it was strange; as the torch beams \nplayed across them, even with most of them completely covered in collapsed \nmasonry, they still didn’t seem as dark as the corridor we’d come from. \nI took some photos – the composition of the place was excellent and the \nblocked doorways had an odd sort of stark grandeur to them. They were \ncertainly well made if they managed to survive what looked to be a direct hit \nby a Germany bomb. I checked the photos and there were no shadows, which \nwas something of a relief. \nWe headed back the other way. When we reached our ropes, hanging down \nfrom the hole above us, Luke started to have some concerns. Well, I say \nconcerns, he wanted out of there. He wanted us to pack up and climb out and \nleave, telling me he was getting ‘weird vibes’ from the place, and trying to \nconvince me we’d seen enough. Looking up at that bright square, lit invitingly \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 063 – The End of the Tunnel \n \n7 \n \nwith the moon shining through the church windows, I was half tempted to \nagree with him. The trouble was that, due to the problems with the first shoot, \nI had one, maybe two pictures of a quality I could do anything with and that \nwasn’t nearly enough. I told him bluntly that I didn’t have enough and if I \ndidn’t get paid, he didn’t get paid. I saw the conflict on his face. He wanted to \nget out of there, sure, but apparently not as much as he wanted to make rent. \nSo, on we went, further into the tunnel. \nI don’t know how far we went. I stopped every 10 metres or so to set up and \ntry to get a good picture, but the shadows were back and worse than before. \nNow there’d be two or three of them in some pictures. It wasn’t quite as \nclearly a human silhouette, so I managed to tell myself that it must be a quirk \nof how the tunnel reflected the light, even though, looking back, that makes no \nsense whatsoever. Still, I kept going, hoping to find somewhere where I could \nget some shots of the stark, gloomy tunnel with bricks so black they almost \nlooked like coal. We’d move, set up, shoot, check and then I’d swear at my \ncamera. \nI don’t know how many times we did this. Luke got jumpier and jumpier the \nwhole way. It didn’t feel like much more than 10 minutes we’d been doing it, \nbut when I checked my watch, we’d been down there for almost two hours. \nWe had finally come to the end of the path and it was just that.
