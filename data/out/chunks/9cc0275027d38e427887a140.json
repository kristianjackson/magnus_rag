I decided to go \nalong and enjoy myself. \nI did enjoy myself in the end. Despite the crowds and the music, I wasn’t \nfeeling quite as wild as I expected but I drank a bit and danced plenty. Ok, \nmaybe I wasn't quite as sober as I said earlier but I certainly wouldn't have \ncalled myself drunk. Now, I wasn’t particularly looking to get laid that night, \nbut I know I’m not an unattractive guy and I live local, so I’m always alert, shall \nwe say, for any possibility of finding myself a partner. It was closing in on \nmidnight when I saw her. She was skinny and had that student look which \ncould have put her age anywhere between nineteen and twenty-eight. Her hair \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG006 – Squirm \n3 \n \nwas long, dyed a deep henna red, and she wore torn tights and too much \neyeliner. Exactly the sort of girl I go for. \nShe was lurking on the dance floor and I wasted no time trying to catch her \neye. It was harder than I’d guessed, though, as her attention seemed to be \nmainly focused on the doors. At first I thought she was waiting for someone \nbut, the more I watched her the more I saw the nervousness in her eyes, \nmaybe even fear? It was at that point she noticed me, and our eyes just locked, \nyou know? She came over and we began to dance together. She was excellent, \nfar better than me, and moved in a smooth, rolling sort of rhythm that made \nthe word “writhe” leap suddenly to my mind. I offered her a drink but she \nrefused, gesturing instead for water, which I happily got. I couldn’t really hear \nher over the music but you don’t go to these nights for conversation. Besides, I \nheard her loud and clear when she leaned over and asked me if I wanted her. I \nsaid yes. Looking back it was stupid, of course it was, but she was beautiful and \nthere was something in the way she moved that really got me. She smiled \nwhen I said yes, and for a moment it looked less like a smile of anticipation and \nmore like a smile of relief. \nOutside the Dogstar it was much quieter and we had a chance to talk. She told \nme her name was Harriet and she was very pleased to hear I lived locally, as it \nwas a cold night. She held my arm tightly as we walked back towards my \nstreet. At first I thought this was for warmth as she didn’t have a coat and I \ndoubted the light jacket she was wearing had much insulation. When I looked \nat her, though, I saw she was looking around the same way she’d been \nwatching the door earlier. Her nervousness was even more obvious now and \nshe was peering intently down every street we passed. I asked her if anything \nwas wrong, and tried to tell her that I lived in a nice neighbourhood, she was \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG006 – Squirm \n4 \n \nperfectly safe, that sort of thing. She nodded and agreed but still seemed \njumpy. \nWhen we were about half way, she started scratching her arms. At first I \nthought she was just rubbing them for warmth, but after a few seconds it \nbecame clear that she was scratching them quite hard, leaving obvious red \nmarks where her fingernails dug in. I was starting to suspect something was \nwrong and asked Harriet if there was anything the matter, anything I should \nknow. She just insisted we head back to my place as quickly as possible. I \nagreed since I figured that whatever the problem was, we could deal with it \neasier in my flat than on the cold streets at midnight. \nBy the time we reached my building, she was staring over her shoulder in near \npanic. I followed her gaze but couldn’t see anything, so quickly opened the \nfront door and let her in. She seemed to relax a bit once we were both in the \nrelatively warm corridor with the door shut firmly behind us. My flat was on \nthe third floor and even though, as I said, I don’t live in a bad area, I did have \nan extra deadlock on my door. Harriet visibly relaxed when she saw it, and \nmore so when it was closed. The skittish glances and scratching her arms \nstopped almost immediately. I offered her a coffee or tea to warm up. She just \nasked for a glass of water, said she was feeling a bit unwell. We sat down and, \nonce I’d fetched her water and fixed myself a coffee, we talked for a while. My \ninstincts had been right – she was a student, studying art. She hadn’t been in \nLondon long, she said, was originally from Salisbury and had been finding it… \ndifficult recently. When she left that pause, I saw in her eyes hints of that panic \nI’d seen on the street. \nI asked her to tell me what was wrong, said s", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 1, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 4500}}
