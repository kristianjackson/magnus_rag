Er, could you ask them to wait a minute or two? \nROSIE \nYep, will do. \nELIAS \nThere. That should make it even easier for you. Right, Detective? I know you \nwere planning to kill me, but surely an arrest is a consolation prize? \nBASIRA \nDaisy? \nELIAS \nOh, didn’t she tell you why she hadn’t gone back to the station? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG092 – Nothing Beside Remains \n14 \n \nAllow me. She rightly suspected that I held evidence of various murders she \nhad committed, and that I sent this to her superiors. \nShe’s quite the killer, your partner. All in the public good, of course. And she \nwas correct, I spent some time acquiring that evidence. Or creating it. And \nwhile your superiors don’t much care about the killings, the fact there is \nproof… They’re not happy. And they want you brought in. \nDAISY \nHeh. So I kill you, and go to jail. I’ll take that deal. \nELIAS \nFor someone who used to be a detective, you’re remarkably reluctant to think \nthings through. You think you’re the only police officer eager to do violence \nand call it justice? No, there are plenty of other rabid dogs out there, mad with \nthe hunt. And some of them have signed a Section 31. There are plenty of \nothers your superiors can call on to clean up this mess. \nBASIRA \nEr… they wouldn’t. \nDAISY \nYeah. They would. \nELIAS \nAnd anyone close enough to be implicated. They will kill Basira. \nMARTIN \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG092 – Nothing Beside Remains \n15 \n \nOkay, wai-wai-wai-wait, that’s the police that you’re talking about! Okay, \nthey… they wouldn’t… Would they? \nDAISY \nI’m sorry, Basira. \nBASIRA \nYeah. \nELIAS \nIf the officers down there take you away… Oh, but perhaps I was wrong when I \ncalled them. Maybe it was a false alarm. \nDAISY \nWhat do you want? \nELIAS \nCollateral. \n[A piece of paper is moved.] \nDAISY \nThat… What? \nELIAS \nA contract of employment. For Basira. \nBASIRA \nUh? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG092 – Nothing Beside Remains \n16 \n \nMARTIN \nWhat? \nARCHIVIST \nOh, no… \nELIAS \nSign it, and I’ll send your ex-colleagues on their way. \nDAISY \nBasira, I… \nTIM \nDon’t do it. \nBASIRA \nThere. \nARCHIVIST \nOh damn it. \nELIAS \nHmm. \n[Elias presses a button the intercom again.] \nFalse alarm, Rosie. Could you apologise to the officers for me, and thank them \nfor their time. \nROSIE (INTERCOM) \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG092 – Nothing Beside Remains \n17 \n \nOh. Um. Alright… \nDAISY \nSo… what, you’re her boss now? Is that supposed to stop me? \nELIAS \nYes. \nMELANIE \nUm, I mean, she’s still got a gun? \nELIAS \nAh, of course. Er, sometimes I forget how new you all are to this. \nBasira is now tied to the Institute. All of you are. Like fingers on a hand. And I \nam the beating heart of it. Should I, or the Institute, be destroyed, you will all, \nunfortunately, follow suit. \nMELANIE \nWait, what? \nTIM \nYup, that sounds about right. \nELIAS \nAnd it would not be a pleasant death. \nDAISY \nBullshit! \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG092 – Nothing Beside Remains \n18 \n \nELIAS \nThen shoot me. Just squeeze the trigger, and watch the only person you care \nabout die screaming. Your last connection to humanity. Do it. \nBASIRA \nDaisy… \nDAISY \nWhat do you want? \nELIAS \nThe police are not the only ones who can find a use for your violence. I’m sure \nthere’ll be plenty here for you to do. Feel free to go where you like in the \nmeantime. I’ll be in touch. \nDAISY \nYou piece of – \nBASIRA \nDaisy, it’s… it’s okay. We’ll figure something out. \nMELANIE \nThis is insane! \nTIM \nYou get used to it. \nELIAS \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG092 – Nothing Beside Remains \n19 \n \nNow that’s taken care of, if you’ll all give me and John a moment alone. I’m \nsure we have some things to discuss. \nDAISY \nYeah. \nMARTIN \nCome on. \n[Everyone else leaves and the door is closed behind them.] \nARCHIVIST \nSo. \nELIAS \nCome on, John, there’s really no need for the scowl. \nARCHIVIST \nWhat do you want? \nELIAS \nHonestly? To offer some congratulations. You’re doing a lot better than I \nexpected. \nARCHIVIST \nFeels like all I’ve managed to do is… not die. \nELIAS \nAnd believe me, that is a remarkably rare skill.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 3, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 4449}}
