Well, enough to tell my story, at least. \nGERTRUDE \nAh, good. Sergeant Walter Heller recording, regarding a discovery made near \nAlexandria during Operation Crusader in November of 1941. Recording date: \n5th September 1997. Any time you’re ready. \nWALTER \nRight. W-w-where do you want me to start? \nGERTRUDE \nWell, you say you were serving in North Africa when it happened? \nWALTER (STATEMENT) \nYes, I-I was with the 2nd Royal Gloucestershire Hussars. We weren’t even \nmeant to be down in Libya originally, but when the pushback against Rommel \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 053 - Crusader \n3 \n \nstarted, the whole brigade was reassigned. We were going to help with \nOperation Crusader. Well, that was fine by me. My brother Francis had died at \nArras when the Germans had pushed through the year before. Rommel had \nbeen in command then as well, and I hated him for it. I knew I’d never get to \ndo anything about it, but I always used to carry an old picture of him I’d clipped \nfrom a newspaper, and I made sure to keep it in my pack, so I’d know him if I \never saw him again, or just in case. \nWell, there were four of us on the tank crew. Frank Malloy was in command, \nRalph McKeller did the driving and we had a loader by the name of Dickie. \nWell, I’m afraid I don’t remember his second name. He wasn’t with us very \nlong. I was the gunner. I’ve always had good eyes, you see, and you really need \nthat for the gun. It’s all very well for Frank to point at a speck on the horizon \nand give us the order to fire, but I’m the one that needs to line up the shot \nclose to a mile away and turn a Nazi tank into a smouldering wreck before they \ncan do the same to us. I was good at it, though I managed to get three \nM13/40s when the fighting started. I would have liked to have had a crack at \nthe Panzer, but it was the Italians who caught us up with at Bir el Gubi, so I \nnever had a chance. Maybe it was just as well. By all accounts, the Germans \nhad a lot more training, so maybe it would have gone even worse for us. But I \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 053 - Crusader \n4 \n \nstill hated having to waste time on the Italians when I knew Rommel and his \nPanzers were out there in the desert somewhere. \nIt was all a bit of a mess, to be honest, that battle. Our air support were meant \nto have bombed their airfields to rubble, but weather had kept them \ngrounded, so we were being hounded by German planes the whole time. The \nItalians had unsurprisingly taken a page out of Rommel’s handbook and they’d \nbacked up their tanks with heavy infantry support, while we were left almost \nentirely on our own. Frank took to the machine gun when he could keep it \npinned down, but it was hard enough to keep our eyes on the enemy tanks, \nwithout constantly having to worry about a Panzerfaust coming out of you \nfrom nowhere. We were still in the Crusader Mark 1s back then, so we had the \nspeed to keep ahead of them, but I was basically useless when we were \ndriving, and any time we stopped long enough for me to get an eye on the \nItalian tank, we ended up a sitting duck for their infantry. All told, I think taking \ndown three of them was a pretty good effort. \nIt was hot that day. I hadn’t been in the desert more than a couple of weeks by \nthen and the sheer heat of the place was still something of a shock. I’m from \nCheltenham, you see, so not exactly used to the blazing sun of a Libyan desert. \nAnd the Crusader, well, for all its advantages, didn’t have very much in the way \nof ventilation, so we were spending a lot of time trapped in what was more or", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 0, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 4252}}
