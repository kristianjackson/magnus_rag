I told myself it was to take care of \nhim, but I’d been there five years before I knew it, and in a lot of ways the old \nman seemed more capable of dealing with the world than me. \nNot that he was supportive. He’d been a vet for most of his life and spent a lot \nof that time working with livestock. I think all those years hanging around \nfarmers must have rubbed off on him. He hated doctors, for instance, \nsomething I always pointed out was absurd given his own job. I’d say he was a \nvet, and he’d say, yeah, he was, and start talking about how many animals he’d \nput down in his career. I never had any interest in continuing the conversation \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 144 – Decrypted \n \n3 \n \nafter that. He’d always been blunt, but after mum died, God, it was like his \nwhole personality became callous. \nI should have left him to himself, but there was something about that dismal \nlittle house, all alone except for old Mrs Whitshaw on one side and the empty \nhouse that no-one could sell on the other. Something kept me rooted there, \nsleeping in a bedroom that hadn’t changed since I was fifteen and caring for a \nman who I’d rather just shut up. We were both trapped there, I think, bound \ntogether in a sort of wordless misery. I would look at him and see a grim sort of \ndestiny for myself, trapped here until I became him, any future I might have \nhad sacrificed to his. \nI always used to go for long walks through the fields to try and escape for a bit. \nI usually managed to walk for about an hour and a half, before my paranoia \nkicked in and I started to worry he’d had a fall or something and I had to head \nback. An hour and a half was plenty, though, for all the places I could go. We \nwere a long way from any real trails, and the most scenic things to see were \nrusted tractors, piles of discarded tyres, or the huge metal skeleton of an old \ndisconnected power pylon. It was a bleak and empty rural wasteland, and \nwhen the summer heat hit, without shade or shelter, it was almost as \nrelentlessly oppressive as that old man. But I still took my walks. \nIt was this last August that it happened. I was about an hour into my walk, \nhaving had a row with him about his failing eyesight, a subject that made him \neven more defensive than usual, and was passing by an old sheet metal barn \nwhen I heard it. I’d been listening to music as I walked, when my iPod abruptly \ncut out. I stopped where I was and took it out of my pocket, assuming I’d \nknocked it or somehow turned it off, but the screen was on, apparently playing \nmusic, though I didn’t immediately recognise the song. I’ve got a pretty sizable \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 144 – Decrypted \n \n4 \n \nmusic collection, but I feel like I do know it pretty well. This one had no artist, \nno album, just the track name: “Numbers”. \nAs I stared at it, I began to hear something from my headphones. It was a faint \nand tinny tone, like it was far off or produced by a low-tech synthesiser or \nsomething. The tone began to shift, and I realised that it was playing a tune. It \nseemed to be a crude rendering of the opening lines of “The Skye Boat Song”. \nIt only got through about a line and a half of the old folk melody before it \nabruptly cut off. There was a moment of silence before it was replaced by a \nvoice, a man, but his voice was so distorted and pitch-shifted that it could have \nbeen anyone. It barely even sounded human as it spoke in its strange \nmonotone. \n“Five. Nine. Three. Seven. Five. Six.” \nNow, I’m not an idiot. I’ve heard about numbers stations, and I know all about \nthe Lincolnshire Poacher and the Russian Man. I know they’ve all got perfectly \nlogical explanations and real world uses for espionage and that. What that \ndidn’t explain, is how a numbers station found its way onto my iPod. I checked, \nand its radio wasn’t even on. It seemed to be coming from my music player, \nthough I had a look through my library and couldn’t find anything that matched \nit. The sky was still grey, though sweat dripped off me as I sat against a rotting \nfence post, and the numbers just kept coming. \n“Three. Zero. Five. Eight. Three. Nine. Two. Eight. Four. Six.” \nEventually I staggered to my feet and began to make my way home. My \nfootsteps were heavy, and my hands shook slightly as I tried to steady myself. \nDo you know that one of the symptoms of a heart attack is literally “a sense of \nimpending doom”?
