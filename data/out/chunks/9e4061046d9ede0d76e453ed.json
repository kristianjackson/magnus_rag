You know I was looking into spectres of war and violence, and I \nfound reports that these soldiers’ ghosts were still manifesting. I did my \nresearch and I figured out where and when I thought it was going to happen \nnext. I told you what I was doing, and then I went to see for myself. I was right, \nthey did manifest, but they weren’t what I thought they’d be, they were... \nfused somehow, all... mixed together. A huge angry mass of dead flesh. And \nguns. I ran away, obviously I ran away. It wasn’t like it could chase me, but... It \nturned out their bullets were more solid than I’d have guessed for ghostly \nantiques and one of them got me. I had it sewn up at the hospital, said I’d been \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG117 – Testament \n \n7 \n \nmugged, although the scans couldn’t find anything in there. And then I came \nhome. \n \nSo yes, that’s it. That’s all you’re getting because it hurt like hell to live through \nand I didn’t do it so you could stroke your chin and call it fascinating. \n \nGood luck, John. I do hope you win. But I also hope it hurts. \n \n(Click) \n \n(Click) \n \nMARTIN \nUm. Statement of Martin Blackwood, on the night of his... colleagues’ \ndeparture. Statement given direct. August 3rd, 2017. \n \nStatement begins. \n \nI, uh... I’m scared. I guess. No, wait, no, no, I mean… (Frustrated) Oh, I don’t \nwant that to be my last message, the thing that defines me. “Martin \nBlackwood. He was always scared, then he died. The end.” I don’t want that. \nBut it’s true, isn’t it? I mean, if you’re right, if these things out there are eating \nour fear then I’m a, a … luxury smorgasboard, I suppose? I’m just afraid all the \ntime. \n \nI know, I know, I’m not going to die. I’m not even going on the incredibly \ndangerous mission. Me and Melanie, well... I don’t think death is really the \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG117 – Testament \n \n8 \n \nworry. It’s just... This feels like an ending, or something, like nothing can go \nback to normal after this. But hey, I mean, what’s normal, right? Is living in an \nold document storage normal? Is losing a friend and not even noticing normal? \nCorridors? Evil all-seeing managers? I suppose you can get used to anything. \nBut this feels different. I need them to be safe. I need him to be ok. \n \nSorry. \n \nI’m not afraid for me, though. Isn’t that weird? I mean, it’s not like I’m going to \nbe safe, like my plan’s not dangerous. But it’s mine. This last couple of years \nI’ve always been running, always hiding, caught in someone else’s trap. But \nnow it’s my trap, and... well … I think it’ll work. I know, it’s not exactly intricate, \nbut it felt good, weaving my own little web. \n \nOh Christ, I hope John doesn’t actually listen to these. (Mimics Archivist’s \nvoice) “Good Lord! Is Martin becoming some sort of spider-person?” (Normal \nvoice again) No, John, it’s an expression. Chill out. Besides, spiders are fine! I \nmean, yes, people are scared of them, obviously, but actual spiders, they just \nwant to help you out with flies. \n \nAnyway. I guess I’m just sick of sitting on my hands, drinking tea and hoping \neveryone’s ok. This way, I finally get to do something. It’s going to hurt, but... \nI’m ready. And I want to. Also, I get to burn some stuff so that’s cool. I just... \nreally hope everyone else makes it back. I don’t want to win on my own. \n \nOh, and I hope the world doesn’t end. Obviously. \n \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG117 – Testament \n \n9 \n \nJust don’t die, John. Or Tim. Or Basira. Or Daisy, I guess. Just everyone please \nmake it back home. \n \n(Click) \n \n(Click) \n \n(Deep, steadying breaths, as a pistol is loaded & holstered, and a combat \nknife is drawn & sharpened) \nDAISY \nOkay. \n \n(Click) \n \n(Click) \n \nTIM \nAll right. I don’t know what you are. I don’t even know if you’re listening. I \ndon’t care. Just, if you’re there, I want you to know that I hate you. I hate you \nfor witnessing what’s happened to us. \n \nI used to blame my brother, for going off on one and poking around where he \nwasn’t wanted. I used to blame myself for not helping him. But now... Now it \ndoesn’t matter. I’ve read through enough of these things to know that this \ndoesn’t matter. The only thing you need to have your life destroyed by this \nstuff is just bad luck. Talk to the wrong person, take the wrong train, open the \nwrong door, and that’s it.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 3, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 4313}}
