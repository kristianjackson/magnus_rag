I’m glad for it now I’ve passed 60 and teeth have \nstopped being something I take for granted, but at 15 the thought never even \ncrossed my mind. But when I lived on Hill Top Road, I cleaned them every \nnight. Up and down and side to side, my arm moving like I didn’t even need to \nthink about it. \nThe other kids living there were the same, at least I think they were. I \nremember them being kind of dull. Not that they were boring, exactly. We’d \nspend time together and smoke and play games and the like, but there was \nsomething about them, as though there were some things that they said and \ndid without anything behind them. Occasionally there’d be flashes of \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 059 – Recluse \n6 \n \nsomething, like the time me and Dick Barradale snuck out after dark and set \nMr Hainsley’s bins on fire, but mostly they were quiet, almost placid. I’m sure \nthey’d have said the same things about me and at the time nothing seemed \namiss. I did what I did because it was what I was supposed to do, and it never \nstruck me to question it. I’m not sure I really recognise who I became while \nliving at that house. \nI did take up reading though. There was a shop down in Cowley that kept a \nbucket of old pulp magazines, marked down to sixpence because they weren’t \nthe latest issue. I used to spend whatever money I had down there and then I’d \nsit under the tree in the back garden and read them cover to cover, over and \nover again. They were daft really, but I loved them. In the summer, with the \nleaves giving you just enough shade to keep cool, I’d say I was happier than I’d \never been before then. \nFor the most part, Ray seemed content to stay out of our hair and leave us to \nour own devices. He had his own study in the basement, where he spent \nalmost all his time, and usually trusted one of us to go to the grocers for food \nand sundries. Aside from church, which he made us attend with him every \nSunday, he rarely went out at all. Occasionally, one of the other residents of \nthe neighbourhood would overcome their distaste for us long enough to ask \nhow Ray was keeping and whether he was well. I gradually got the sense that, \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 059 – Recluse \n7 \n \nwith the exception of the teenagers staying at his house, Raymond Fielding \nwas something of a recluse. A well-liked recluse, certainly, but to see him leave \nthe house on any day other than a Sunday was quite a remarkable thing. \nAside from church, there was one other regular activity that he always insisted \nwe take part in. We generally ate our meals in the dining room, which was a bit \ncramped sometimes as, when full, there were eight of us in the house aside \nfrom Ray, and the table was barely big enough. On Sunday evenings, however, \nwe’d all gather for the evening meal and before we sat down to eat, he would \nremove the bright white tablecloth that covered it and we’d gather around the \ndark wood. \nI remember it was carved in all sorts of strange swirling designs and patterns. It \nfelt like if you picked a line, any line, you could follow it through to the centre \nto some deep truth, if only your eye could keep track of the strand that had \ncaught it. The centre of the table looked at first like it was simply part of the \nwooden top, but if you looked closely, as I did so often, you could see an \noutline marking the very middle as a small, square box, carved with patterns \njust like the ones that laced their way over the rest of the table. I don’t \nremember how long we sat around the table those evenings, nor do I have any \nmemory of what we might have eaten.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 2, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 3635}}
