Then it's covered by Section 31 and can't be revealed under \nthe Freedom of Information Act. There's a whole bunch of other NDA stuff in \nthere as well, but it basically means you have to keep quiet about it. \nThing is, signing your first Section 31 really marks you out. Word spreads fast in \na station, and once they see you’ve signed one, people start to push you in \nthat direction. They call you ‘sectioned’, which I guess is kind of appropriate? \nYou're generally assigned to head out with others who've signed, and if any \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG043 – Section 31 \n4 \n \nofficers get a whiff of something weird from a scene, they'll wait 'til you \narrive, rather than going in themselves and risk getting sectioned themselves. I \nsuppose in some ways it's kind of a unit, but not one with any funding or \ntraining or official power. Just a bunch of burned out cops with a retirement \nrate five times the average. \nThat's why it took so long to get a car here when your friend found Miss \nRobinson's body. I was on a burglary call-out with Carver, the only other \nsectioned officer on shift, and you can bet no- one else was responding to a \ncall from the Magnus Institute. No offence. \nARCHIVIST \nNone taken. And full names, please. \nBASIRA \nWhat? Oh, PC Richard Carver. \nARCHIVIST \nThank you. \nI did notice you seemed less... taken aback by the large number of shrivelled \nsilver worm corpses than I would have expected. \nBASIRA \nYeah. I mean, that was easily one of the most disgusting things I've seen on \nthe job, but not the weirdest. \nARCHIVIST \nShall we start at the beginning, then? \nBASIRA \nOkay, well, the first time I got hit with a Section 31 was five years ago, August \n2011. I'd got my badge the year before that, and was still getting used to some \nof the more stressful bits of the job. The week before this happened, I'd heard \nan officer get his leg shattered by some arsehole with a cricket bat. We were \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG043 – Section 31 \n5 \n \nspeeding towards the scene, but couldn't do anything but listen to it over the \nradio. That sort of thing it, it does something to your brain; that mix of \nadrenaline and helplessness, so... so I was still a bit rattled when the call came \nin. \nThere was a fire out near Clapham – a residential home had gone up, and the \nfire brigade were \ncalling for some police back-up. Apparently the homeowner was getting \nviolent, and there were suspicions of arson. I was riding with John Spencer \nback then. We didn't really get on – let's just say I wasn't a fan of the tone he \nalways used when he said the word “diversity”, though I never had enough to \nbring any real grievance about it. Even so, he didn't deserve what happened to \nhim. \nSo we arrive at the smoking ruin of a house, and the firefighters have got it \npretty much locked down, just a lot of smoke and damp rubble, except for \nwhere we see a couple of firefighters struggling to keep a guy restrained. He \nwas a Hispanic male, probably mid-to-late 40s, heavy set with a completely \nshaved head. Another of the firefighters, this one with a fresh black eye, \ncomes over to brief us. Apparently the guy had burst out of the house shortly \nafter they arrived, not a single burn mark on him. The fire brigade had \napproached to see what help he needed, but instead he just started throwing \npunches and trying to run. \nThat was an assault charge, sure, but why the arson? The fireman just sort of \nnods to him, and I realise for the first time the bald guy’s saying something. \nNot loud, but intensely. I mean, this was \nyears ago, so I don’t remember exactly what he was saying, but it definitely \ninvolved the words “cleansing fire”, “all shall be ash” and the name Asag,", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 1, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 3881}}
