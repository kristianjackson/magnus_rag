You must think me \ndreadful for not even giving you a chance at a reply, but I recall that during \nyour visit last spring you mentioned your fascination with the macabre and \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG023 – Schwartzwald \n2 \n \nstrange, and pressed upon me as to whether there were any such lore or \nlegends that I myself were familiar with. Wolfgang writes me that you are \nacquiring quite the collection, and I feel that I now have something that \nbelongs with it, far more than any of the fairy stories or old maids’ tales that I \ntold you before. Put quite simply, I have had a most terrifying encounter. Two \nencounters, really, I suppose, and I pray to the Lord that I shall have no more. \nFor I honestly believe I should die, from fear if not from violence, were I forced \nto meet the thing again. \nI’m sure you must think me the most dreadful bore, speaking around the thing \nso, but I feel that to understand all I must begin my tale some time before the \napparition itself appeared, with my travels down to Württemberg. My family \nhas a small estate there, in the heart of the Schwarzwald, what you would call \nthe Black Forest, near a small town by the name of Schramberg. This estate \nbelonged to my brother, Henrik, and when he passed away it descended to my \nnephew Wilhelm. He was barely in his fourteenth year when Henrik died, and \nhis mother had passed while birthing him, so myself and Clara have since made \nevery effort to provide him with guidance and such affection as he may have \nlost. This felt especially keen as we have ourselves been unable to conceive a \nchild, and so we felt it our duty to teach Wilhelm what we would have \nimpressed upon a son of our own. The profligacy of youth is always a danger, \nand we felt it our duty to help guide him, where we could, along the path of \nvirtue. We needn’t have worried ourselves overly: I have never met so sober \nand prudent a soul as seems to exist within young Wilhelm. Nonetheless, \nbecause of this we have remained close with my nephew through the years, \ndespite the distance. When he took ill this last winter, naturally we made \narrangements to travel to his home in the Schwarzwald and offer what comfort \nwe could.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 0, "chunk_count": 10, "chars": 3039}}
