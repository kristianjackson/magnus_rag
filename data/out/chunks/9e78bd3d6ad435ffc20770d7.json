I grabbed it with my good arm, tried to \nescape it, but the grip was too strong. The texture of the flesh was like hard \nrubber. All I could do was watch as my partner kept walking into the earth on \nstairs that couldn’t be there. After a few seconds, he was completely out of \nsight. \nI expected to hear something, shouting, a scream, something. But it was still \njust the rain. The lid closed very slowly, and then he was gone. Just a coffin \nsitting on the hard shoulder of the M6. The hand released my shoulder as the \ntwo men in overalls began to walk over and calmly wrap the chains back \naround it. I felt a sudden burst of anger and picked up my baton. I lunged at \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 061 – Hard Shoulder \n \n16 \n \nthem, but the one closest to me moved quicker than I would have thought \npossible. His fist slammed into my chest like a cannonball and I felt a couple of \nribs break. I collapsed to the floor, just lay there, as Tom and the two men \nlocked the coffin back up, loaded it into the van and drove off. I never saw \nIsaac Masters again. \nWhen I called it in, I was expecting a manhunt, an investigation, some kind of \njustice. It wasn’t like we didn’t have plenty of leads. Instead, I was handed a \nform I didn’t recognise, told to sign it and then reassigned to the Met. Since \nthen, it’s been one spook story after another. \nARCHIVIST \nRight. Thank you. Um... are you quite all right? \nDAISY \nNo. I never told that story to anyone except my old Sergeant. \nARCHIVIST \nI-I’m not sure I... \n[Daisy stands.] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 061 – Hard Shoulder \n \n17 \n \nDAISY \nI should go. \nARCHIVIST \nYes, of course. I’ll see you out. There is one other thing. I’ve been meaning to \nask Basira, but you might know better– \nDAISY \nI’m done. \nARCHIVIST \nOh, yes, it’s just... do you know anything about vampires? \n(Pause.) \nDAISY \nYeah. \nARCHIVIST \nOh, it’s just that we– \nDAISY \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 061 – Hard Shoulder \n \n18 \n \nA while back there were some problems: arrest irregularities around a few \nmissing person cases; suspects being released without proper interrogation. \nRecordings of the interviews showed the subject wouldn’t say a word, but the \nofficers doing the interview would let them go anyway. I don’t know the details \nof the investigation, but there’s an operating procedure now. \nARCHIVIST \nWhich would be? \nDAISY \nCases matching certain parameters have to be monitored by another officer \noutside the room via video. In the very specific circumstance where the \nsuspect says nothing, but the interrogating officer acts as though they have, \nthey’re immediately removed from the room. Then they call me. \nARCHIVIST \nJust you? \nDAISY \nThere are a few others around who do it, but I take care of a dozen or so \nprecincts. I cuff the suspect’s hands and legs, drive them out into the middle of \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 061 – Hard Shoulder \n \n19 \n \nEpping Forest and burn them to ashes. There’s never enough left to be a \nproblem. \n(The Archvist sighs) \nDAISY \nI don’t know if they’re vampires, exactly, but that’s what we call them. \nARCHIVIST \nGood Lord. H-how many have you... taken care of? \nDAISY \nFive in the last nine years. \nARCHIVIST \nI see. \nDAISY \nDon’t tell Basira. She doesn’t know about that procedure. I’m not sure how \nmuch she’d understand. She, she’s not cut out for that kind of work. \nARCHIVIST \nOf course. I, I won’t. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 061 – Hard Shoulder \n \n20 \n \nDAISY \nDon’t tell her any of this, okay? I was never here. If she wants to get you more \ntapes, that’s her business, but you keep this visit to yourself. Got that? \nARCHIVIST \nO-of course. \nDAISY \nGood. \n[Tape clicks off. Tape clicks on.] \nARCHIVIST \nSupplemental. \nThat was... an interesting interview. It seems we’re not done with sinister \ncoffins just yet. And the contents were... surprising, to say the least, but don’t \ngive any real clues as to its origin, purpose, or even its relationship with \nBreekon and Hope. Are they simply couriers? Guardians? Hostages? At least I \nalso have confirmation that the vampires Trevor Herbert described are not \npurely figments of a drug-addled mind.
