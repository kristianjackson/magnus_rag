And sure, maybe they might \nstill have a bit of movement in them after the bolt, and maybe their heart still \nbeats, but for all they talk about “stunning” or “irreversible brain damage”, \npulling that trigger sure felt like killing to me. \nThere was another man who worked the floor, bleeding the animals. His name \nwas Tom Haan, and I had never really spoke to him. For the longest time I \nwasn’t even sure how much English he spoke – he was from China, I think, and \nhardly ever said a word. The first time I really heard his voice was that day, the \nday it all started. I’d been feeling strange about work ever since I started on \nthe killing floor, and had finally asked to be moved positions. Now, the official \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG030 – Killing Floor \n5 \n \ncompany policy was that any request to leave the killing floor has to be \ngranted, but in practice no-one asks to be moved. It shows a weakness that \nmost of the people working there aren’t comfortable with. I did it anyway, and \nhad just received word that, from the following day, I was being moved to \nbutchering the carcasses. I don’t remember how I felt. My feelings weren’t \nreally working back then. \nAnyway, it was as I was processing the last of the cows for that day that Tom \nHaan came over. I didn’t really pay him much attention, but he leaned close, \ngripped my shoulder and said to me in perfect English, “You cannot stop \nslaughter by closing the door.” I felt a chill pass through me, and I wanted to \nturn round and demand to know what he was talking about, but he’d already \nreturned to the bleeding crew. I was a bit shaken for the rest of the day, and \nknowing that these were the last animals I’d need to actually kill made each \npull of the trigger harder, not easier. I just turned off my mind and let my \nmechanical motions take over. Cow into the holding pen, lock its head in place, \ngun against temple, pull the trigger. Over and over again, until I felt like I was \nalmost in a trance. \nIt was the silence that finally brought me back to myself. I was waiting for the \nnext in the line of cattle to be herded into the room, and I noticed that I \ncouldn’t hear anything. There wasn’t the scared lowing of the animals, the far-\noff whine of saws or the rumble of any one of the hundreds of machines that \nhum and churn to keep the abattoir running. I waited and waited, but no more \ncows came. Looking around I couldn’t see anyone. There was no clock in that \nroom, nor did I wear a watch. A buzzer would usually sound when breaks rolled \naround, and I hadn’t heard anything.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 2, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 2708}}
