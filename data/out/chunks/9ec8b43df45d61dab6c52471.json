Episode one hundred and thirty-\neight. The Architecture of Fear. \n[The tape clicks on. We hear the rattle of chains. The voices in the following \nconversation echo.] \nELIAS \nThere. Much better. \nMARTIN \nYou know I don’t care if John hears this. \nELIAS \nCome on, Martin, it’s been so long since I’ve seen you; let’s not start with lies. \nMARTIN \n(Sighs) Fine. \nELIAS \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 138 – The Architecture of Fear \n \n2 \n \nI am so very pleased to see you. \nMARTIN \nMmhmm. \nELIAS \nNo time for pleasantries? Very well then, to business. What can I do for you? \nTired of running budgets for Peter? I know I would be. \nMARTIN \nI— I need to— \nIs he telling the truth? \nELIAS \nAbout what? \nMARTIN \nAny of it? \nELIAS \nEverything Peter has told you is true. \nMARTIN \nOh. \nELIAS \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 138 – The Architecture of Fear \n \n3 \n \nFor all his… many faults, Peter is legitimately trying to stop the end of the \nworld as we know it. \nMARTIN \nSo why haven’t you helped him? \nELIAS \nMy relationship to the apocalypse is more... complicated. \nMARTIN \nOh, seriously? \nELIAS \nSeriously. Anyway, I have helped him. I’ve given him control of the Institute, \nI’ve provided him with— \nMARTIN \nMe. \nELIAS \n—any manpower he might require. \nMARTIN \nYeah, but i— If he’s right about The Extinction, what it is, then why didn’t you \nsay anything before? Why am I only hearing about this now? And why doesn’t \nJohn know!? \nELIAS \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 138 – The Architecture of Fear \n \n4 \n \nIn my case, while Peter has talked of it before, it is only very recently that I’ve \nbeen forced to admit The Extinction is real. And as for our dear Archivist, I’m \nafraid I no longer have any real control over what he does or does not know. \nUnlike yourself. \nI notice you haven’t told him either. \nMARTIN \nYeah well, I’m still not sure I really believe it. \nA-And I don’t— I’m... \nELIAS \nWorried he might charge off into another coffin? \n... \nQuite. \nAs for why I have done so little about such a looming existential threat, to be \nblunt: I have been rather busy. \n(Martin snorts.) \nELIAS \nBesides which, don’t forget I am still living at Her Majesty’s pleasure, due in no \nsmall part to your actions. So by this point all I can do is confirm that \neverything Peter has told you is true. \nMARTIN \nI think he wants me to join The Lonely. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 138 – The Architecture of Fear \n \n5 \n \nELIAS \nThen it sounds like you have a decision to make. \nMARTIN \n(Incredulous) What? That’s it? No, no monologue? No mind games? You love \nmanipulating people. \nELIAS \nThat makes two of us. But no, this too important for me to jeopardise with \ncheap “mind games”. I simply have to trust that when the time comes, you’ll \nmake the right choice. \nMARTIN \nGreat. \n(Sotto voce) Great. Great. \nSo what you’re actually saying is that you’re going to be no help whatsoever? \nELIAS \n(Smilingly) Just like old times. \nMARTIN \nI don’t know what I expected. Right. \nRight. We’re done here. \n[Chair scrapes, footsteps move away] \nELIAS \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 138 – The Architecture of Fear \n \n6 \n \nDon’t forget to keep in touch Martin. There are so many people in here, but \nwithout one’s friends... \n[Door opens and closes]] \nELIAS \n ...it does get rather lonely. \n[Tape clicks off. Tape clicks on.] \nMARTIN \nMartin Blackwood, Assistant to Peter Lukas, Head of the Magnus Institute, \nrecording statement number 8671302, statement of Robert Smirke, taken \nfrom a letter to Jonah Magnus dated 13th February 1867. \n(Clears throat.) \nMARTIN (STATEMENT) \nMy dear Jonah, \nYou will forgive me, I hope, for being so forward, but I feel I must break the \nsilence that has characterised our acquaintance for these past decades. You \nsee, Jonah, I feel the hour of my death approaching and, though you have \nalways been reluctant to pay due heed to my warnings or counsel, I continue \nto see in you the reflection of my own past hubris. I could not go easy to my \ngrave without offering you one last plea for your restraint. What we built at \nMillbank should be left well enough alone, resigned to the nightmares of the \nreprobates and brigands contained within its walls.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 0, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 4377}}
