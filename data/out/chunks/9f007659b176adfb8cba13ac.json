I grew up in the little village of Algasovo, \ndeep in the forest steppes. We were tiny, far below the notice of the district’s \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG044 – Tightrope \n2 \n \nрайсовет, and as such we were quite a poor community, with little hope of \nbeing added to the circus routes as anything but a waystation. Every year he \nwould take my brother Ivan and me, and we would make the journey down to \nMorshansk to see the circus as soon as it arrived. \nJugglers, acrobats, wild animals… it took my breath away every time. My \nfavourites were the clowns. Not as you would think of them; I’ve seen what \nyou call clowns in this country, but back then clowns would actually tell jokes, \nnot simply hit each other and fall over. I didn’t always understand the jokes \nthey told, but there was something intoxicating about sitting there, \nsurrounded by people all laughing and cheering. Even if I didn’t always share \ntheir amusement, I always shared in their joy. \nI never liked the acrobats, though. I would watch them swinging from the top \nof the tents, leaping between the trapeze or walking their tightropes, and my \nchest would tighten, and all I could see in my mind would be the image of \nthem falling to the sand-covered floor. I’ve never been afraid of heights myself, \nyou understand; I used to spend half my summers at the top of the tallest trees \nI could find. When I was six, my best friend Piotr fell when we were climbing \ntogether. He survived, but broke his leg so badly that he still walks with a limp \ntoday. From that moment, that long terrible moment when I watched him fall, \nwhenever I would watch the acrobats fly through the air it was all I could do \nnot to close my eyes. Still, that doesn’t change the fact that my visit to the \ncircus in Morshansk remains some of the happiest memories I have of my \nchildhood. \nOne day in early November, the circus came to Algasovo. To say this was \nstrange is to put it very mildly. As I’ve said, we were a small village, and far \nbelow the notice of the troupes that travelled the region.
