As he laid down, I \nheard him say something else. I thought it sounded like “the show must go \non”, and at that moment, you know, I actually thought that was a good sign. I \nwatched for a few more minutes until he was asleep, and then I went back to \nbed, though it was a while before I fell back to sleep. \nThat night was the last time I ever saw Danny. When I woke up a few hours \nlater, he was gone. \nHe left no note, no hint of where he may have gone, and the only thing that \nshowed he’d been back at all were a small pile of sketches he’d drawn on some \nscrap paper from my printer. On each there was a clown, the same clown. A \n\nshock of dark hair, vertical on the top of his head, porcelain white face, bright \nred lips painted in a wide, pointed smile, and a crimson diamond running down \neach cheek from just below his eyes. The lips may have been smiling, but the \nmouth my brother had drawn was dark, an empty circle that made me feel \ncold. \nI should have called the police. Well, maybe not, now I’ve met some of the \nones who’ve dealt with these cases. But I shouldn’t have followed him. I \nshouldn’t have checked the notes Danny left about where to get in, and what \nto watch out for en route. There was never really any hope for me, though, \nwas there? This was how it was always going to go. \nDanny’s notes were very comprehensive, and finding the entrance to the old, \ndisused part under the Royal Opera House wasn’t nearly as difficult as I \nthought it might be. He hadn’t reattached the chain he’d broken to get in, and \nit didn’t look like anyone had noticed to replace it. The entrance stood open, \nand even though it was the middle of the day, it became almost completely \ndark as soon as it crossed the threshold. I think he must have done some work \non the hinges too, because even though I could see the rust eating through \nthem, the door opened in complete silence. I stepped inside. \nBack then I didn’t know enough about Robert Smirke’s architecture to \nrecognise his work; I just thought it was a really well-preserved sub-level. The \ncorridors were wide and solid, and my torch showed columns that were that \nregular geometry that I’ve come to recognise. Compared to the summer heat \noutside, the air was cold. I found myself shivering in just my T-shirt and shorts. \nThe whole place looked spotless, a lot cleaner than any pictures I’ve ever seen \nof urban exploration or abandoned sites. I couldn’t really see why the Royal \n\nOpera House above wouldn’t use this space, why they’d just let it sit here \nuntouched and hidden behind a locked and unmarked steel door just off of \nJames Street. I was still wondering about this when I walked into the \nauditorium. \nAt the time I wasn’t exactly sure what I was looking at, but I’ve now seen \npictures of the second Theatre Royal in Covent Garden, the one designed by \nSmirke, and I can say it was identical. A perfect recreation of the old stage and \ntiered seats, the decorations and the boxes. There were only two differences: \nthat it was almost twenty feet below the ground where the original stage was, \nand that everything, from the floor, to the seats, to the blank and faceless \naudience was entirely hewn out of crude stone. There was no light except for \nthe headlamp I had taken from my brother’s pack and it swept over a full \nhouse, four levels of unmoving stone watchers, two thumb-sized indentations \nfocused towards the stage. There was nothing that indicated they were any \nnewer than the rest of the place. \nI walked down the steps to the edge of the top level, where I’d entered, and I \nlooked down towards the stage. My lamp barely illuminated the single figure \nthat stood on it. (Sigh) It was Danny. At least, I, I think it was. It looked like him; \nthe same hair, the same clothes, but there was something not right about how \nhe looked. Like he was smaller, somehow, slightly folded in on himself. It didn’t \nmatter; I shouted down to him, to let him know I was there. He didn’t look up, \nbut when my voice echoed around the stone theatre, I knew I’d made a \nhorrible mistake. \nFrom somewhere above me, a spotlight suddenly turned on, shining down \nonto the stage, painfully bright against the white stone.
