Well. I guess that’s it then. \nA one… \n(Big inhale then sharp exhale) \n[He releases his grip and falls] \n[Increasingly furious wind noise as the Archivist and tape recorder \ngain speed] \n[Tape clicks off] \n[Tape clicks on] \n[A wasteland wind swirls] \n[Gritty gore sound as the Archivist recovers] \n(The Archivist groans in pain) \nMARTIN \nJohn? \nARCHIVIST \n(Pained) Mm-hmm. I’m here. \nI am here. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 198 – Precipice \n24 \nBASIRA \nCome on, even Martin didn’t make this much fuss. \nMARTIN \nI resent that. \n(Martin coughs) \nARCHIVIST \n(Wincing) There is a big difference between knowing pain and experiencing it. \nMARTIN \nDon’t worry, it passes pretty quickly. \nARCHIVIST \nI know. \nMARTIN \nOf course you do. \nARCHIVIST \nBut it hasn’t passed yet. \nMARTIN \nNope. \nBASIRA \nAlright, let’s get you up. \n[Archivist is assisted up with some pained exclamations] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 198 – Precipice \n25 \nARCHIVIST \nOkay. I’m okay. \nBASIRA \nMartin says that’s London up ahead. \nARCHIVIST \nYes. \nBASIRA \nLooks even more messed up than usual. \nARCHIVIST \nYeah. We, uh, we should be okay, but best be careful. \nMARTIN \nYeah keep an eye out. \nBASIRA \nWas that a joke or…? \nARCHIVIST \nCome on. Let’s get home. \n[Footsteps as they start walking] \nMARTIN \nYou mean the tunnels? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 198 – Precipice \n26 \nARCHIVIST \nI suppose. I don’t really know. \n(A few last pained noises from the Archivist) \n[Tape clicks off] \n[Tape clicks on] \n[Footsteps and voices echo as Martin, the Archivist and Basira \nproceed through the tunnels] \nMARTIN \nHello? \nARCHIVIST \nGeorgie? Melanie? \nMELANIE \n(Muffled) In here. \n[Footsteps continue; they open the door to the supplies/Leitner \nroom and enter] \nMARTIN \nHey, what happened here? Are you both okay? Where is everyone? \nGEORGIE \n(Upset) They came for them. Took them away. Like before. \nARCHIVIST \nOh god. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 198 – Precipice \n27 \nMARTIN \nWho’s ‘they’? \nGEORGIE \nThe… things from the city. You know, the, the ones that serve that big eye. \nARCHIVIST \nBecause of me? \nMELANIE \n(Accusatory) Probably. \nGEORGIE \nW— It doesn’t matter. (sighs) It’s the same as last time. We thought, maybe \nkeeping our numbers down might help, but… No, it was um, it was always \nborrowed time. \nMELANIE \nW-We tried to stop them, but— \nGEORGIE \nThere, there were just too many. W-we couldn't do anything. Just had to listen \nas they were dragged off. \nMARTIN \nI’m so sorry. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 198 – Precipice \n28 \nBASIRA \nDamn. \nMELANIE \nHa-Hang on? Basira, is that you? \n[Basira steps towards Melanie] \nBASIRA \nHeya Melanie. How, um, how are you? \nMELANIE \nI’m fi— I mean… \n[Melanie fidgets with her folded can] \nMELANIE (CONT’D) \nfine compared to— You know. \nAnyway, come here. \n[Melanie and Basira hug] \nWhere’ve you been? \nBASIRA \nJust wandering. I’ll tell you about it later. \nGEORGIE \nYou got Martin back, then? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 198 – Precipice \n29 \nARCHIVIST \nWe did. \nMARTIN \nI was actually doing alright until you showed up, and then Annabelle started \nacting up for company. \nBASIRA \nAt which point we rescued you from certain death. \nMARTIN \n(Grumbling) Well, hardly certain death. \nGEORGIE \nWell, it’s good to see you in one piece. I assume the spider-woman is, um...? \nARCHIVIST \nActually, no, it’s a bit more complicated than that. \n(Georgie makes an unsatisfied noise) \nMELANIE \nNo, I’ll have a real answer thanks. \nMARTIN \nAnnabelle wasn’t trying to kill anyone. She just wanted to offer us a choice. \nSort of, tell us about another option, I guess.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 4, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 4446}}
