In the picture, however, it was not. \nThe raincoat mannequin had, it seemed, been… disassembled, then rebuilt into \na tangled bunch of limbs and joints. The torso was upside down and the two \narms jutted out from the front and back of the pelvis, bending up to hold the \nmannequin’s head aloft. It had been dressed in an assortment of lurid red and \npurple shirts from our pyjama range, and someone had clearly stolen some \npaints from the craft department and daubed a colourful, smiling face on top \nof the blank space that had previously been there. They had finished it with a \nred pompom crudely glued onto the top of the head. The effect was alarming \nand put me in mind of a clown. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG083 – Drawing a Blank \n9 \n \nI looked up to see Lana’s eyes staring into me, acutely scrutinizing my reaction. \nThe confusion and mild horror on my face seemed to put her a little bit at \nease, but she was still a long way from relaxed. I told her it wasn’t me, that I \nhad no idea who would have done it or why, that I definitely didn’t see or hear \nanything out of the ordinary, all the standard excuses. She nodded, though it \nwas clear nothing I said was really helping the situation. Finally, I asked about \nCCTV, and she shook her head. There hadn’t been any focused on the \nvandalised display, and whoever had done it had clearly known enough about \nthe camera placements to avoid them. Another reason, apparently, they \nsuspected it was done by someone who worked there. \nWe went back and forth for about ten minutes, until at last she said she \nbelieved me, and wouldn’t pursue disciplinary action, but without any other \ncredible explanation there was no way she could keep letting me stay behind \nalone. Not least because, technically, she shouldn’t even have been doing it in \nthe first place. I was upset, of course, but I also realised I was getting off \ncomparatively lightly, so I didn’t make a fuss. \nThe next couple of weeks were difficult. Drawing the displays in the shop had \nhelped me centre myself, gave me some positive associations with the place. \nWithout it, Fanton’s was just where I worked. And more importantly, \nsomewhere I constantly had to deal with the public, all their rudeness and \nstupidity and fake pity. To be honest, I was finding it harder and harder to keep \nmy patience. \nThere was something else, though. Without being able to rely on me to close \nup, Lana had assigned it on a rota to the others in our team. Nobody really \nwanted the job, and a few of them moaned to me privately, but they didn’t \nexactly have a say in the matter. But as the days went by I noticed that some of \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG083 – Drawing a Blank \n10 \n \nmy colleagues were getting nervous, jumping at little noises and glancing over \ntheir shoulder. It always seemed to be the person who’d been closing up the \nnight before. And through it all that ringmistress stood there, malicious and \nunmoving, brandishing her whip ready to strike. \nFinally it happened. Last Wednesday, Lana couldn’t find anyone else to do the \nlast shift, Jan had a doctor’s appointment, Liam had a family emergency… you \nget the idea. Lana was going to have to do it herself. I’d been working very \nhard over the days prior to get back in her good graces, and I managed to \nconvince her to let me do the last shift with her, and stick around to do some \ndrawing while she locked up, promising that I’d be out of the door as soon as \nshe was. She reluctantly agreed. \nSo Wednesday rolled around, and the day went very much as normal, maybe a \nbit quieter than usual, but not so you’d notice. There was a slight… something \nin the air though, an anticipation. I thought at the time it was me, since I’d \ndecided to use this opportunity to try and exorcise some of the feelings of \nunease and finally draw the mannequin that was making me so uncomfortable. \nBut now I don’t think I had anything to do with it at all. \nEverything was closed up, everyone else had left. It was just me and Lana. And \nshe was making the final checks to lock up. I ran to the changing rooms and \ngrabbed the small bag from my locker that contained my pencils, inks and \npaper, and then hurried back and over to the womenswear department. I \ncouldn’t hear Lana anywhere, which is strange as she usually provided \nsomething of a running commentary, but I didn’t really notice. \nThen I rounded the corner of one of the aisles and stopped dead: the \nmannequin was gone.
