Said she was spending the day with this Tom of hers. \n\nMARTIN \nAnything nice? \nARCHIVIST \nDidn't say. \nMARTIN \nHave you ever actually met him? \nARCHIVIST \nWhy would I have? We're don't exactly hold socials. He sounds nice enough, I \nsuppose. In a Kensington sort of way. You ever met him? \nMARTIN \nNo but she’s pretty private with that stuff. Not like Tim. \nARCHIVIST \nHm. \nMARTIN \nJust talk to him, please. \nARCHIVIST \nI think we’ve said more than enough. I doubt there’s much more words can do \nfor us. \nMARTIN \nYou can’t work together like this. \n\nARCHIVIST \nIronically, I think working is all Tim and I can do together \nMARTIN \nLook. Jon… when was the last time we all just talked? Just talked, without all of \nthis– \nARCHIVIST \nThank you for the tea, Martin. \nMARTIN \nOk. Fine. \n[Martin opens the door.] \nHe’s not wrong, you know. \n[Martin leaves, closing the door behind him.] \nARCHIVIST \nI know. Statement of Darren Harlow… (Sigh) Statement of Darren Harlow \nregarding a failed psychology experiment at the University of Surrey. Original \nstatement given 18th November 2010. Audio recording by Jonathan Sims, \nHead Archivist of the Magnus Institute, London. \nStatement begins. \nARCHIVIST (STATEMENT) \nThings always seem so obvious in retrospect. That experiment was always a \nterrible idea. Even at the time, I remember thinking it sounded like something \n\nout of a horror movie. I mean, every time I heard a new detail about it I’d go \nhome and tell my wife and we’d speculate over dinner about how it was going \nto go wrong in some grotesque and horrific way. We’d laugh and suggest the \nways it could turn those poor grad students into crazed killers or mutated \nmonsters. And when I started to see more and more spiders around the lab, I \nturned the very real sense of unease into the… the fun sort of fear, like I was \njust playing at being scared. It’s so strange, even when you’re really looking for \nhorror, it’s impossible to actually believe it. It always feels like something you \nmade up. Just having a bit of fun scaring yourself. Because those things don’t \nhappen. Not in the real world. But you think sometimes about what the real \nworld is. Just what your brain mixes together from what your senses tell you. \nWe create the world in a lot of ways. I suppose it shouldn’t be surprising that, \nwhen we’re not being careful, we can change it. Before you ask any in-depth \nquestions about the methodologies or structure of the experiment, I should \nmake it clear – I’m just one of the cleaners. I have no idea how or why they \nstarted it or, god knows, where the funding came from. I find it hard to believe \nthe Psych Department okayed it, but I’m not an academic, and those decisions \nare way over my head. I mainly take care of the science labs. \nMost of the cleaning crews at the university get shifted around a lot, working \nin different buildings or departments one month to the next, but there’s a lot \nof stuff in the labs that requires additional training to clean safely, so we’re a \nbit more specialised than the rest. I mean, they still didn’t let us within spitting \ndistance of the really expensive equipment; that was all taken care of by the \nlab techs, but the point is I’m a much more familiar face around the science \ndepartments than a cleaner would otherwise be. There’s also the fact that the \nscience lot actually talked to me on occasion. I don’t want to say it’s ‘cause I’m", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 0, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 4016}}
