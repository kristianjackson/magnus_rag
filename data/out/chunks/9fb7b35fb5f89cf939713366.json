I just hope he gets \nback soon. \n \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG108 – Monologue \n \n9 \n \nYou know, saying it out loud, I, I think I’m actually really worried about \nMelanie. I... You know what, Basira knows her better than I do. I’ve been too \nawkward to ask, but I need to. I really think I need to— \n \n(Strange creaking noise, Martin exhales shakily) \n(Door opens) \n \nMARTIN \nBasira? Melanie? Tim? \n \n(Door closes) \n \nPETER \nMartin, isn’t it? \n \nMARTIN \n(Surprised and scared) It’s you! Don’t move. Uh ... Um ... Don’t you come any \nnearer. I, I have a knife. \n \nPETER \nDo you? That would seem ... wildly out of character, from what I’ve been told. \n \nMARTIN \nOk, but— You stay back. \n \nPETER \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG108 – Monologue \n \n10 \n \nPlease, Martin, I’m not going to hurt you. I just thought we might have a chat. \nAlone. \n \nMARTIN \nOh. You’re one of them, aren’t you? A, a Lukas. \n \nPETER \n(Surprised) Yes, that's ... Peter. Pleased to meet you. Now, how did you know \nthat? \n \nMARTIN \nI, I was just reading, uh... John left some notes, and— \n \nPETER \nAh, I see. I'm sorry to have disturbed you. It’s one of Elias’ little jokes. \n \nMARTIN \nI don’t— What? \n \nPETER \nDid he suggest you record a statement today? One that mentioned me? \n \nMARTIN \nUh, yeah. Sort of? I mean, not you specifically, but ... \n \nPETER \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG108 – Monologue \n \n11 \n \nRight. I have a meeting with him today. He suggested ... I’m sure he’s watching \nfrom his office, grinning from ear to ear. \n \nMARTIN \nUh, I don’t... \n \nPETER \nI almost thought he genuinely wanted me to meet the team. Ah well. \n \nMARTIN \nI’m really sorry, I don't, uh... \n \nPETER \nDo I scare you, Martin? \n \nMARTIN \nYes. \n \nPETER \nHm. Probably for the best. And what’s Elias like to work for? Aside from \norchestrating unsettling encounters. \n \nMARTIN \nUm, that's a lot of it, to be honest. \n \nPETER \nAnd that's not something you look for in an employer, I assume. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG108 – Monologue \n \n12 \n \n \nMARTIN \nWell, he’s ... I mean, you’ve just— You’ve just said he’s watching us? \n \nPETER \nAlmost certainly. How is he as a boss? \n \nMARTIN \nFine, I guess? I mean, not so much with the manipulation and ... sometimes the \nmurder? \n \nPETER \nOh. That doesn't sound like the Elias I know. He killed people himself? \n \nMARTIN \nI mean, I wasn't, uh, I wasn't there, but that's what he said. And I did see the \nbody. Bodies. \n \nPETER \nElias Bouchard getting his hands dirty. Well, well, it must be the end times. \n \nMARTIN \nI, I don't ... \n \nPETER \nSo, your advice would be less murder? \n \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG108 – Monologue \n \n13 \n \nMARTIN \nI, I suppose? \n \nPETER \nNo, no, it's a good observation. I thank you for it. \n \nMARTIN \nYou're welcome. \n \nPETER \nWell, I’m sure I’ve disturbed you quite enough for one day, Martin. I have a \nmeeting to get to, and a few things to tell Elias to his face about wasting both \nour time. Be seeing you, as it were. \n \nMARTIN \nYeah, uh, bye. \n \n(Door opens and closes) \n \nMARTIN \nWhat? \n \n(Door opens) \n \nBASIRA \nDid you call me? \n \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG108 – Monologue \n \n14 \n \nMARTIN \nYeah, uh, I ... Did you see anyone? \n \nBASIRA \nWhen? \n \nMARTIN \nOut there, just now. \n \nBASIRA \nUm, no? \n \nMARTIN \nNo? \n \nBASIRA \nNo. \n \nMARTIN \nThat figures. \n \nBASIRA \nSo, did you need anything or? \n \nMARTIN \nDoes the name Peter Lukas mean anything to you? \n \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG108 – Monologue \n \n15 \n \nBASIRA \nOh! Yes, actually! I’ve been reading a bunch of the old statements; he’s the \ncreepy boat captain, right? From that family Elias doesn’t want us bothering? \n \nMARTIN \nYeah, well, apparently that warning doesn’t go both ways. \n \nBASIRA \nHe was here? \n \nMARTIN \nYeah, I, I think so. \n \nBASIRA \nWas he ... \n \n(Basira makes spooky sound) \n \nMARTIN \nI mean, a bit, yeah. \n \nBASIRA \nOh. Oh dear. \n \nMARTIN \nMaybe? I don’t know. Honestly, he was just a bit ... weird.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 4, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 3908}}
