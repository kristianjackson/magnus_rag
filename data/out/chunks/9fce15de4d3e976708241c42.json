Scratching his notes and formulae into \nhis skin with a fragment of splintered obsidian. It does not matter, time means \nnothing in the pursuit of knowledge, and he has no concerns except the \nsolution. And he has cracked it. His mouth breaks into a smile, lip splitting in \nthe grin, spilling a drop or two of scarlet onto skin so pale as to now be near-\ntranslucent. He has seen the others pointlessly wandering the halls, of course. \nSimpering pretenders claiming to see patterns when they are only being led by \nthe siren call of their pathetic little biases. Their ridiculous pet theories. Not \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 183 – Monument \n14 \nlike him. They’ll remember him forever, the first to escape the Monument. His \nname will be hallowed with the greats: Doctor...uh… Doctor... \nIt doesn’t matter. There will be time enough for names and gloating and \nawards once his achievement is secured. And now is the time to put it to the \ntest, to prove once and for all that his peers are ignorant amateurs beside him, \nwho can finally boast that he has found the key to the system in which they all \nstruggle. He begins to walk, calmly, and with a measured certainty, to the east. \nFiguring out which way was east was the first step, and the most simplistic \none, for the central chamber in which he had positioned himself received a ray \nof light from above at regular intervals that could only be sunlight. And thus it \nwas a simple matter to track the course of the light to determine which \ndirection was east and which was west. Once he had noticed that, it was all \nabout keeping a close eye on the timing of the shifts, cross-referenced with the \ncompass-point. In a westward direction, the corridors would invert every forty-\nseven seconds and shift incline every twenty, as well as growing a door to a \nstaircase every two minutes. The staircase would always be descending except \nfor every fifth door, which would go up and twist to the north. And just like \nthat, he had plucked order from what would, to any of the other charlatans \nthat wandered this prison of geometry, appear to be true chaos. It was east \nthat he travelled now, however, because every eighty seconds, the second \ncorridor to the east made a sharp upwards inversion, leading to a full minute \nwhere every seven seconds a door would sprout from the ground. Only the \nfirst of these doors would lead you to the true path that will— \nA dead end. Wait. No. This… wasn’t right. The first of the doors would lead \nhim… Maybe that wasn’t the first of the doors. But it, it was, it was the first \ndoor. But that would mean... No, he, he was right, he was certain, he had \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 183 – Monument \n15 \nfactored in all the timings. This didn’t make sense. It, it wasn’t fair! He had the \nanswer!

But it is not the fall that terrifies him, not the pain of the impacts, but \nthe fact that none of them should be there. That it doesn’t make sense. And it \nmust make sense. There must be a system. There must be, because if there \nisn’t... \n[The body lands wetly and solidly] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nHe lands with a heavy smack onto rough limestone and lies still, his body \ntwisted and broken. He knows it will knit itself back together, slowly, painfully, \nas it always has before. But the thought of starting over, of composing yet \nanother theory, fills him with a deep dread. \n[Sounds of the body continuing to knit itself together]", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 3, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 3903}}
