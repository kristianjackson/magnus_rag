It was a grey, overcast day and \nthe forecast had said there would be rain later, so I was keen to move the last \nof my boxes inside and start unpacking, and didn't really pay him much \nattention. I remember that he was wearing a hooded jacket, though, pulled up \ntight and obscuring most of his face. We locked eyes briefly – at least I assume \nwe did – I couldn't see his eyes but I felt him looking at me – and I could swear \nI smelled the weirdest odour. It's hard to describe, halfway between the smell \nof a pavement after rain on a hot day and chicken that's starting to turn. It was \nunpleasant, to say the least, but the wind changed and it was gone as quickly \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG018 – The Man Upstairs \n3 \n \nas it came. The man in the upstairs window kept watching as I took my boxes \ninside, just continuing to smoke in silence, ‘til at one point I came outside to \nget the last bits and noticed he was gone. \nI was slightly spooked by the encounter. It's hard to say exactly why, as aside \nfrom the smell, which could have come from anywhere, there was nothing \noutwardly upsetting about it, yet something in the man's manner had shaken \nme. I didn't even know at the time whether it was a man, that was just an \nassumption I made but I certainly had no plans to check. I'm quite a private \nperson, so the idea of going round and trying to meet my neighbours at all was \nnot one that I gave a lot of consideration, let alone this one who had spent the \nbetter part of half an hour staring at me. I decided to ignore the whole thing, \nand get on with the process of moving in. \nI was very successful at ignoring the man upstairs, at least at first. It wasn't \ndifficult, as he was usually quiet and rarely came out of his flat as far as I could \ntell. In fact, as the time in my new home wore on I started to recognise the \nother residents of Welbeck House: the white family that lived across the hall, \nwith their little girl – I sometimes heard her in the evening, loudly protesting \nher bedtime; the old spinster next door – Dianne, I think her name was, or \nDiana; the Asian guy on the first floor that worked nights and slammed the \ndoors too much. I doubt I ever exchanged more than a dozen words with any \nof them but I began to know their sounds and their habits. In all that time, \nthough, I'm not sure I ever saw the man who lived above me. Not in the \nhallway, not out the window, it was like he didn't exist, which was fine by me, \nexcept that I would still very occasionally catch a whiff of that smell. Rotten \nand earthy, it would catch me by surprise and I'd usually spend a minute trying \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG018 – The Man Upstairs \n4 \n \nto track it down before it vanished. Once, I swear that as I stopped to look \naround I heard the door upstairs close quietly. \nIt seemed to me pretty obvious it was him. It wasn't ideal, but his hygiene \nproblem was nobody's business but his own, and having figured out the source \nof the smell, it stopped bothering me quite so much on those rare moments \nthat I caught it in the air currents of our building. It didn't enter my home, \nalthough I did take to lighting scented candles just in case – a habit I still keep \nup today. I decided all that was important to me was that he was quiet, which \nhe was. At least, for the first couple of years. \nThe banging started on 5th July 2004. I know because it was the day before my \nthirty-seventh birthday, and I was unpacking a crate of beer for the friends I \nhad invited over. At first I assumed the man upstairs was just nailing something \ninto the wall but after ten minutes it still hadn't stopped. Instead, it just \nseemed to move. While at first it had sounded like something being nailed into \nhis wall, the banging started to move downwards, until it seemed he was \nknocking things right into the floor. At one point he was hammering directly \nover the light, causing it to sway slightly with each blow. This went on for \nalmost an hour, and all I could do was try to ignore it, as there was nothing I \nwanted to do less than climb those stairs and knock on his door. Even so, by \nthe time it finally finished I was on the verge of doing exactly that. It did stop, \nthough, and after it became clear it wasn't coming back any time soon, I tried \nto put it out of my mind and get back to my preparations. \nThankfully, there was no disturbance from upstairs during my small party the \nfollowing night, just the family from across the", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 1, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 4499}}
