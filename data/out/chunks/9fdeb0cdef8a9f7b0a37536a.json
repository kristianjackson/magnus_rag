People who care! \nUnless… \n[Martin gets up and walks slowly and unsurely] \nMARTIN (CONT'D) \nHello? \n[A door creaks open, as he walks into another room; a ticking clock \nis here, with the same tick-tock sound as the one in the first room] \nMARTIN (CONT'D) \nHe- Hello? \n[He keeps walking] \nMARTIN (CONT'D) \nAll these rooms.... I think they're the same as this one. I, I don't know why I'd \ndecorate my house like this; I don't like it, I like… \nWh, i-it's not my home; it can't be. Do I have a home? This-this place feels like \nit's all for me, I think, but I don't… \n[He sits in a chair that sounds identical to the previous one] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 170 – Recollection \n8 \nMARTIN (CONT'D) \n(Shaky) I don't like it here. \nIt-it can't be cheap living here, house this big. I really need a job. (animated) \nStarted lying on my CV; did I tell you that. I didn't want to. I-I mean I tried to be \na good person, but we're really up against it, and I, and I know they're going to \nfind me out; I just know it. (anxious) They'll ask something, or I'll say \nsomething stupid, and then, and then they'll know. They'll know, and then… \n(shaky exhale) (under breath, unintelligible) Oh… (agitated) What am I doing, \nI can't afford a place like this! I need money, not ju— not just for me, but for, \nfor... \n(Calmer) Wait. Wait, no; it is, it is just me, isn't it? It's always been just me. \n[Hissing static starts] \nMARTIN (CONT'D) \nNo... No, no, no, that's not right! I, I'm not alone, no! Not alone, there's, \nthere's, J-J-John? John. (remembering) John! John! \n[Martin stands and takes a few steps] \n[Hissing static ends] \nMARTIN (CONT'D) \n(Calling) John? John, I'm here, can you hear me? I can't, it's, it's this place, I, \nwh-where are you, I need you, I nee— (humourless laugh) I need you, John. \nWhere, wh-where did you go? \n[A couple more steps] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 170 – Recollection \n9 \nMARTIN (CONT'D) \n(Near tears) Please don't leave me. I can't do this on my own. Please. (sob) I'm \nnot enough on my own. Alone. All. All alone. \n(Shaky breaths) \n[He walks to the chair and sits down] \n[Hissing static starts] \nMARTIN (CONT'D) \n(Pleasant) Oh. Oh, hello, huh, what's this? \n[Hissing static ends] \n[Brief tape recorder handling] \nMARTIN (CONT'D) \nWow, retro! What are you up to, little buddy, just listening? Ah, that's okay. It's \nnice to have someone to talk to. \n[Chair creaks] \nMARTIN (CONT'D) \nMaybe you can keep a better handle on things than me. It's this fog, you \nknow? Makes it so hard to see. \n(Quick, quiet) What was I saying? \n(Normal) I feel like there's somewhere I need to be, but… but no, no, this is my \nhouse, huh, where else would I need to be? I just— \n[Chair scrapes against the floorboards] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 170 – Recollection \n10 \nMARTIN (CONT'D) \nI wish I had more comfortable chairs. Would be nice to have somewhere \nrelaxing to sit down. Rest a bit when Mum's asleep. Did I tell you about my \nmum? \n(Hushed) We should try to keep quiet actually, you know. Make sure not to \nwake her. The drugs they, they hit her pretty hard, but if you make enough \nnoise and she wakes up, and… and yeah, it's not good. (bravado) Not a good \ntime! (unhappy laugh) \nI-I know she loves me, I, I know she does. But that doesn't make it easy. There's \nalways so much to do, and I'm always forgetting something. I do try, you \nknow? I mean, I really try to keep on top of things, but I'm just, I'm just so \nforgetful, and she-she… \n[Chair creaks] \nMARTIN (CONT'D) \nSometimes I wonder if I forget things on purpose. Easier not to think about \nthem, I guess. Easier to just let them slip away. They can't hurt you if you don't \nthink about them, they can't shout at you or call you names. (emotional) And I, \nI always think of Mum's face when I've done something wrong, and I… wait. \n[Chair creaks] \nMARTIN (CONT'D) \nWait I don’t, her face, I. I don't remember her face. Did, did she have a face? \n(berating) D-don't be-don't be stupid, Martin; of course she had a face! \n(agitated) You just can't remember it ‘cause, ‘cause you're a bad son; because", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 2, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 4149}}
