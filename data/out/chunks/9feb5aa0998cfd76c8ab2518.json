In these new worlds they would exist as they used to in \nours, lurking just beyond the threshold. \nARCHIVIST \nUntil someone is stupid enough to release them there as well. \nANNABELLE \nPerhaps. Even the Mother cannot see the future. Only try to shape it. \nARCHIVIST \nAnd so they spread through realities like a disease! \nANNABELLE \nPerhaps. \nARCHIVIST \n…I won’t do it. \nANNABELLE \nPossibly. You’ve seen your other options. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 197 – Connected \n27 \nBASIRA \nWhat happens to you if they escape? What happens to us? We’ve all been \ntouched by them. \nANNABELLE \nI would either travel with them, or I would die. I do not know which. My life is \nonly sustained by The Web. Most would simply lose whatever power they have \nbeen gifted. \nJohn would lose much of himself, the parts of him that are The Eye. But he \nwould survive. And perhaps more importantly, he would remain who he \nbelieves himself to be. And you would end the suffering of all those others who \nremain here. \n(Beat) \nBASIRA \nHow would we do it? \nARCHIVIST \nBasira! \nBASIRA \nWe need to know, John. \nANNABELLE \nIt’s very simple. \nDestroy the Archives, and cut out The Eye’s pupil. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 197 – Connected \n28 \nBASIRA \n(Sarcastic) Oh is that all? \nANNABELLE \nSimultaneously. \n(Muffled despondency from Martin) \nARCHIVIST \nI see. Destroy the Panopticon, and you release its power. Kill Jonah, and you \ncut the connection between the Fears and the world. Do both at the same \ntime, and… for just a moment, all that power rushes through their only \nremaining connection with reality: the tapes. \nANNABELLE \nAnd they would be swept along by it, dragged out of our realities, and into new \nones... \nBASIRA \nAnd how exactly are we supposed to destroy the Archives? \nANNABELLE \nMany years ago a draughtsman made an unfortunate and egregious error on \ncertain city planning documents. As a result, an unusually large and dangerous \ngas main just happened to be constructed directly below the building you \nknew as the Magnus Institute, in a place where it would be protected by the \ntunnels of Robert Smirke, unchanged by the world’s reformation. You need \nonly ignite it. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 197 – Connected \n29 \nARCHIVIST \nIgnite it? \nANNABELLE \nIndeed. And it just so happens that the perfect tool was once delivered to you \nas a token of appreciation. Though you really do need to learn to keep better \ncare of it. Somehow, it always seems to slip your mind, doesn’t it? \nARCHIVIST \nWhat? \nBASIRA \nJohn, it’s that stupid lighter of yours. \nARCHIVIST \n(Indignant) My what? \n[Hissing static starts] \n[The Archivist pulls the gold lighter with embossed spiderweb from \npocket and flicks it open] \nOh? \nOh. \n[Hissing static ends] \nANNABELLE \nA little anchor of our power, so that we, and our tapes, may follow wherever \nyou go. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 197 – Connected \n30 \nARCHIVIST \nI see. \nSo… \n[Flicks lighter shut] \n…if I were to throw it away— \n(Annabelle gasps) \n—into your little pit... \n(Muffled worry from Martin) \nANNABELLE \n(Carefully) I would advise against that. \nARCHIVIST \nOh, would you. \nBASIRA \nJohn, she still has Martin. \n(Muffled mm-hmm! reminder from Martin) \n(Beat) \nARCHIVIST \nFine! \nFine. \nThat’s it, then? Everything you wanted to tell us? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 197 – Connected \n31 \nANNABELLE \nIt is. \nARCHIVIST \nThen we’re done here. Give us Martin. \nANNABELLE \nAs you wish. \n[Annabelle rips Martin free from his sticky restraints] \n[Martin staggers to the Archivist, coughing and spluttering] \nMARTIN \nJohn! \nARCHIVIST \nMartin! \n[Fabric rustles as Martin and the Archivist embrace] \nMARTIN \nOh god, I’m sorry, I— \nARCHIVIST \nIt’s fine. \nMARTIN \n—didn’t realise that—", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 5, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 3980}}
