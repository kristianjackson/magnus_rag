Haven’t really had the time to \nfoll— \n[There’s a noise – Tim is entering the room from the tunnels.] \nAh… \n\n(The Archivist takes a deep breath.) \n[The sound of something wooden being moved – a trap door, or covering \nperhaps.] \nARCHIVIST \nHello Tim. \nTIM \nOh god… \nARCHIVIST \nCome in, please. \nTIM \n(False politeness) Good to see you, Boss. How’ve you been? \nARCHIVIST \nI’m not going to lie to you, Tim. It’s been a difficult few months. \nTIM \n(Deadpan) Good. \nARCHIVIST \nAnd h— I would like to hear how you’ve been doing. \nTIM \nMe? Oh, I’ve been just fine. I’ll see you later. \n\nARCHIVIST \nYou’re sure? You’ve not— There is nothing you want to say to me. \nTIM \nNothing with that thing here, no. \nARCHIVIST \n(Softly) Interesting. What do you think is listening? \nTIM \nWhat? \nARCHIVIST \nWhat do you think is listening to the tapes? \nTIM \nDon’t do that. \nARCHIVIST \nSorry. \nTIM \nDon’t! \nARCHIVIST \nSorry, I didn’t— \nTIM \n\nAnd you know what I think. It’s that... the thing that runs the Institute. “The \nWatcher” or “The Eye” or whatever. \nARCHIVIST \nI dis… I disagree. This whole place is a temple to The Eye, Tim. I don’t think the \ntape recorders make any difference. \nTIM \nElias, then. \nARCHIVIST \nIn that case we’ll stick to talking about things he already knows. \nTIM \nWhy are you so set on having it running? \nARCHIVIST \nI... Look, if you want my honest opinion— \nTIM \nI don’t. \nARCHIVIST \nWhatever is on the other side of those tapes is just as invested in stopping the \nCircus as you are in avenging your brother. \nTIM \nYou listened to it, then? My statement. \n\nARCHIVIST \nI listened to all the tapes. I, I had no idea how much of a… a mess I left this \nplace in, I-I-I’m sorry. \nTIM \nBit of an invasion of privacy. \nARCHIVIST \nI assume that’s a joke? \nTIM \n(Laugh) Isn’t it just? How did you know I was going to be here? \nARCHIVIST \nTh-The others haven’t seen you in weeks, and you’ve still been using the \ncomputers here, accessing files and books... I know there are some exits to the \ntunnels outside the Institute, so I guessed you were using them to get in and \nout, avoiding any… tape recorders. \nTIM \nOkay, whatever. But how did you know I was going to be here, now? \nARCHIVIST \nI just… did. \nTIM \n\n“You just did”? Great. Buy one spooky telepath manager, get one free, is it? \nFan—tastic. \nARCHIVIST \nThat’s not what this is. \nTIM \nOh, and how about you read my mind now? \nARCHIVIST \nTim, that isn’t... I can’t. \nTIM \n‘Cause I can give you a clue. It ends in “off”. \nARCHIVIST \nI... I assume you’ve been doing your own research into the Circus and the \nUnknowing. I would like to pool our knowledge. \nTIM \nSo why don’t you ‘Archivist’ me, then? Just pull it straight out. \nARCHIVIST \nBecause I don’t want to. I am not your enemy, Tim. \nTIM \nLike that matters. These things aren’t human. It’s... instinct. You can’t not. \n\nARCHIVIST \n(Quieter) I’m still me, Tim. I’m still me. \nTIM \n(Exhales) You know what? You’re actually right. \nARCHIVIST \nWhat? \nTIM \nYou’re the only one. \nARCHIVIST \nI— S-Sorry, I do-don’t follow. Tim? \nTIM \nDo you know why I avoid the others? \nARCHIVIST \nUh, y-you said, the tapes... \nTIM \nNo. How can I be sure who they are? \nARCHIVIST \nOh… \nTIM \n\nYou know how long that thing pretended to be Sasha? \nARCHIVIST \nOh god. \nTIM \nAnd I had no idea? I knew Sasha for years, we… (Pause) I don’t know Martin as \nwell as I knew her. I barely know what Melanie and Basira look like. Or that \nweird murder-cop. How the hell am I supposed to be sure of any of them? \nARCHIVIST \n(Soft) Tim, I… I didn’t realise. I-I didn’t think. I’m sorry. \nTIM \nI mean, there’s worms and hallways and clowns, and... In some ways it doesn’t \neven register. Like, just another spook. But I can’t trust them. I’m going to \ndestroy the Circus that took my brother, and I can’t trust them to help. \nARCHIVIST \nAnd me? \nTIM \n(Snort) Well, if you’re trying to spy on us, you’re doing a pretty shitty job. You \nhaven’t been here for months. \nARCHIVIST \nThat’s not fair! Sometimes I was kidnapped.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 3, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 4120}}
