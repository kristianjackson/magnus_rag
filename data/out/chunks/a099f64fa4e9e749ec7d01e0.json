That was a secret! \nMARTIN \nI didn’t say anything! \nJONAH \nHe didn’t have to. Nothing escapes my notice, and I like to keep an eye out for \nthis sort of thing. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 161 – Dwelling \n7 \nTIM \nWell- it’s- good to see you. \nARCHIVIST \nYes- Y,yes! \n[Chair movement] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nCome in! \nJONAH \nSo, how old is the birthday boy? \nARCHIVIST \nUh- thirty-eight. \nSASHA \n(Tch-ing) Liar. \n(Slight laugh from Tim) \nARCHIVIST \n(Petulant) How would you know. \nTIM \nWhat, does someone need to change their password again? \nARCHIVIST \nI- what? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 161 – Dwelling \n8 \n(Tim laughs) \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nSasha, have you been going through my computer- \nSASHA \nDefinitely not; No idea what he’s talking about. \nTIM \n’Course not! \n(Tim and Sasha laugh in the background) \nARCHIVIST \n(Under his breath) That’s really not appropriate. \n(Crosstalk) (Sighs) \nMARTIN \n(Crosstalk) Oh, come on, guys! \nJONAH \nAnyway. Ah- did somebody mentioned cake. \nTIM \nUh, yeah. You did. \nJONAH \nYes, I did, didn’t I. \n(beat) \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 161 – Dwelling \n9 \nTIM \n(Sighs) Alright, alright. Well, I guess the cat’s out of the bag now anyway, look- \njust give me a second. \n(Archivist sighs) \n[Cake tin and ceramic sounds as Tim gets the cake ready] \nTIM (CONT’D) \n(Sings) Happy birthday- \n(Martin, Sasha and Jonah joins in) \nJONAH, MARTIN, TIM, SASHA \n-to you. \nARCHIVIST \n(Embarrassed) Oh, okay. \nMARTIN \nMhm! \nJONAH, MARTIN, TIM, SASHA \nHappy birthday to you. \nARCHIVIST \nRight! \nJONAH, MARTIN, TIM, SASHA \nHappy birth- \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 161 – Dwelling \n10 \nARCHIVIST \nYes!

I do hope you’re not planning to light those candles. \nTIM \nOh, goodness. \n[He shakes a box of matches] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 161 – Dwelling \n11 \nTIM (CONT’D) \nA source of ignition? In the Archives? \n(Sasha laughs) \nTIM (CONT’D) \nUh-oh. \nARCHIVIST \n(Crosstalk) Tim. \nTIM \n(Crosstalk) Mmm. \nOh. Whoops! \n[Strikes a match] \n[The flame crackles as he lights each a candle] \nTIM (CONT’D) \nSorry. My hand slipped. \nAnd again- \nAnd again- \nAnd a couple more times- here, I’m so clumsy today; that is a lot of fire. \n[The candles continue to crackle in the background] \nARCHIVIST \nI’m really not comfortable- \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 161 – Dwelling \n12 \nSASHA \nSo blow them out, then. \nARCHIVIST \nOh. (Slight pause) Right, yeah- \nJONAH \nAnd make a wish. \nARCHIVIST \nIf I wish for you all to go away, do you think it’ll work? \nTIM \nHe’s so grumpy today, isn’t he Martin? \nMARTIN \n(Crosstalk) Uh- oh! Well, um- \nTIM \n(Crosstalk) Do you think it’s his looming sense of mortality? \nMARTIN \n(Splutters) Uh- I, I don’t think- \nARCHIVIST \nFine. \n[He blows out the candles, which is followed by cheers and \nhandclaps] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 161 – Dwelling \n13 \nTIM \nSo, what did you wish for? \n[Hissing static, as from previous seasons, begins] \nARCHIVIST \nI can’t tell you. \nJONAH \nHe wished for a little bit of peace and quiet. \nARCHIVIST \n(Small inhale) Was it that obvious? \n[Hissing static ends] \nJONAH \nOh, I wouldn’t worry, John. It’s an Archive. Quiet is very much the course du \njour. \nTIM \nWell, after the party, at least. Wine, anyone? \nARCHIVIST \nTim, it’s eleven in the morning. \n[A cork pops] \nTIM \nPfft, yeah, at your birthday party. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 161 – Dwelling \n14 \n[He begins pouring the wine] \nARCHIVIST \nI really don’t think it’s appropriate- \nJONAH \nI’ll allow it. In fact! I’ll join you. \nARCHIVIST \n(Surprised) Oh! O-kay, um, a-al, alright then? \n[Sounds of continued pouring behind all this] \nSASHA \nMartin? \nMARTIN \nOh! Uh, (slight laugh) I mean- I don’t- normally- drink wine, you know- t-\ntannins are a proven headache trigger, and so- \nSASHA \nMartin. \nMARTIN \nW-, uh- (more stuttering) - yeah, sure, maybe, just uh, a drop. Heh. \n[Pouring ends] \nARCHIVIST \n(Informatively) You know that there’s a lot of tannin in tea as well?", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 1, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 4277}}
