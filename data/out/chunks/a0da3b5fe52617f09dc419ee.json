At that point, he’d just got out of his first real relationship, and it \nwas one that had lasted nearly a decade, but to hear him talk about it, it \nsounded like he’d never actually been happy. I mean, it didn’t even sound like \nhappiness was a consideration for him when thinking about it. For the last four \nyears of the relationship, she had just treated him worse and worse, taken \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 123 - Web Development \n12 \n \nmore and more liberties and he’d just tried to shrug it off. He still does. He \nwasn’t even the one to end things – she’d found herself a rich, older guy fresh \nfrom a divorce and just disappeared, something Greg once described as, “fair \nenough, I suppose”. \nOh, as another example, when I was first getting to know Greg, I went for a \ndrink with him that I mistakenly thought was romantic. I mean, he’s not a bad \nlooking guy, but he’d intended the evening as purely platonic. Do you know \nhow long we ‘dated’ before I realised what had happened and actually pressed \nhim on the whole misunderstanding? Two months. Sometimes I think if I’d just \nbeen a little bit more oblivious, we’d be married by now. \nAnyway, all this is to try and explain why, when it started to get really weird, \nGreg didn’t just quit the job. I mean, it’s a freelance web project, and from \nwhat he’s said it doesn’t even pay very well. He wouldn’t be breaking any \ncontract, and the client hardly ever even gets in touch. There is no reason that \nhe couldn’t just walk away, but I honestly don’t think he ever will. And I really \ndon’t know how it’s going to end for him. \nI knew it was going to be bad as soon as he started telling me about it. I mean, \nGreg doesn’t really talk about work unless something’s gone badly, and he \nwants to not listen to me tell him to drop whatever project he’s locked himself \ninto. And this job was red flags all the way down. An email out of the blue from \nwhat looked like a personal address, rather than a business one. Vague, \noccasionally contradictory descriptions of what they actually wanted the site to \ndo. I mean, even the email was a bit strange: not the broken or algorithmic \nEnglish I’d have expected – the short message was quite well composed – but \nfor some reason something in it caused the font to appear incredibly large, and \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 123 - Web Development \n13 \n \nGreg had had to scroll through almost word by word. None of it was exactly \nwhat you’d call a good sign. \nBut, Greg being Greg, he was taking a train down to Guildford before you know \nit to meet the client in person in a small coffee shop just off the high street. As \nhe told it, she was young, rail thin underneath an oversized, brown hoodie, \nwhich she kept pulled up, trying to cover up a network of pale stitches that \nstretched over one side of her head. She didn’t say much, other than to briefly \noutline the job. \nShe wanted a forum made, though she couldn’t seem to explain exactly what \naudience or topic she wanted it to be targeted towards, or why she couldn’t \nuse any of the countless online services that specifically made and adminned \nforums. She just mumbled something about custom requirements and told \nGreg to drink his latte. Which he did, so he tells me, though he can’t stand milk \nin his coffee. All through it, she just kept staring at him, hands pressed into the \npockets of her hoodie, occasionally pushing long, spindly fingers out against \nthe fabric, smiling to herself. \nI haven’t given the name of this mystery client, because, to be honest, Greg’s \nnever told me. I’ve asked him, plenty of times, but whenever I do, he gives me \nthis surprised look, insists he’s told me before, and then immediately forgets \nand changes the subject. I know that’s not exactly helpful, but honestly, I’m a \nbit lost here myself. I mean, none of this feels normal. Some of it doesn’t even \nfeel natural. Greg’s an odd one, sure, but until recently he’s always been very \nsharp. \nThis was all about six months ago. He’s been working on the website ever \nsince. The actual basic setup took him all of two days, maybe a bit more since", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 2, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 4415}}
