And the door remained closed. \nAnd that was it. I was trapped alone in a tiny room, floating in space – \ndeserted, empty space. I had plenty of food and water, so starvation wasn’t a \ndanger, but sometime in the first week the clock stopped working. With no \ntimepiece and nothing left outside of the sun or moon, keeping any sort of \ntime at all became utterly impossible. If I had to guess how long I spent in that \nstrange exile, I would say somewhere between three and six months. But that \nis based solely on my eating and sleeping patterns, which were largely fuelled \nby despair and that quiet, aching terror of being utterly forsaken. I couldn’t \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 057 – Personal Space \n \n10 \n \neven read my books or watch anything, as characters seemed dead and \nlifeless, the emptiness of their artificial existence made plain to me. \nThe hallucinations stopped. I did not even get the comfort of company in my \ndelusions, though at some point the line between dreaming and reality \nseemed to blur and I would be sleeping, strapped into my bed in the middle of \nthe void, while at the same time floating through ancient graveyards or the \nopen, empty sea. They weren’t hallucinations though, they were dreams. Even \nif the cold did seem to seep out of them and into the bones of me. \nI spent so long trying to get that door open, but nothing worked. The \nmechanisms and electronics were not accessible from my side. When I finally \nstopped trying, it was the final abandoning of my hope. That was also when I \nnoticed something else that alarmed me in a very different way. I did some \ncalculations and realised that my food and water levels did not seem to be \ndepleting. For all the time I had been there, in what I could now only think of \nas my imprisonment, it did not seem like there had been any significant change \nin my supplies. No one could be re-stocking me because there was no one but \nme there. If the food remained static then, did that mean I could remain \ntrapped in this place for the rest of my life? Assuming I even still aged. I began \nto very seriously consider the idea that I had died and this was hell. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 057 – Personal Space \n \n11 \n \nGiven that worry, the way I finally escaped could be considered ironic. I starved \nmyself to death. Well, not to death, I suppose, given I’m alive enough to talk to \nyou, but close enough. I don’t know how long I just floated there, strapped into \nmy lonely cocoon of a bed, refusing to eat or drink and waiting for the end. \nAfter everything else, I had no guarantee it was even possible for me to die, \nbut I had to try. When I finally faded from consciousness for what I hoped was \nthe last time, it was the greatest relief I have ever felt. \nI don’t know exactly when I realised I wasn’t dead. There were various \nmoments I faded back into consciousness and I know that I felt the re-entry \nvery hard, but it’s difficult to pin down clear thoughts before the hospital. No \none’s really given me an official account of what happened, aside from that it \nbecame known I was in serious danger of death and my colleagues on the \nDaedalus retrieved me and managed to keep me alive until the next \nopportunity to send me back down. I’m not pushing to know more, not really. I \nknow what happened and no rational cover story that they could feed me is \ngoing to change it. I haven’t followed up with Conrad and, as far as I’m aware, \nhe hasn’t made any attempt to contact me. I was paid in full though, which \nwas a surprise.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 4, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 3582}}
