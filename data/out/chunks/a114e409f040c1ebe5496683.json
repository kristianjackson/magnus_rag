Hmm. Is that a possibility? \nARCHIVIST \nI don’t know. I still can’t see him. \nMARTIN \n…Then I guess we’ll find out. \nARCHIVIST \nLet’s move on. I don’t need to attract any more attention. \nMARTIN \nEr, yeah. \nARCHIVIST \nBesides, turns out I can feel a statement coming on, and I’d rather not do it \nwith any more of an audience than absolutely necessary. \n[Tape clicks off] \n[Tape clicks on] \n[Whispers echo indistinguishably, some camera iris movements] \n[The Archivist’s voice sounds more resonant, as if in an empty \nroom, then adopts usual statement tone] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 188 – Centre of Attention \n \n12 \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nAlright. Hm. You want a show so badly? \nFine. \n[Hissing static starts] \n[City sounds; helicopters, city trains, crowds; with camera iris \nmovements] \n[Hissing static ends] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nLondon. Carmen hated London. She had only ever moved here because there \nwere no jobs in her field outside of it, though right now she couldn’t have told \nyou for certain what her field actually was. When she had first arrived she had \nalmost convinced herself she liked it, but that had worn thin very quickly, and \nrecently the place had changed. It felt… different. \nIt had always watched her; Carmen had never been under any illusion about \nthat. Most surveilled city in the world, so much so that you didn’t even notice \nmost of the time. She would barely register the bank of CCTV monitors on the \nside of the bus that cycled through angles until you were staring at the side of \nyour own head. And she had lived next to a small park for two years before she \nrealised the huge metal pole in the middle of the pathways wasn’t a \nstreetlamp, but a bank of cameras. \nShe had once counted how many times she could spot a camera watching her \nduring her morning run: thirty-one in ten minutes. At least, it had been back \nthen. Last time she had tried it there were hundreds. They tracked her \nmovements, and made so much noise that she could not have ignored them if \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 188 – Centre of Attention \n \n13 \nshe had tried. It was halfway between the mechanical whir of a focusing lens \nand the low rattle of mean-spirited laughter. Carmen didn’t go running \nanymore. \n[The city sounds transition to become muffled] \n[A bed creaks in sympathy with Carmen’s movements] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nShe lay in bed now, the lights of the streetlamps below her window washing \nout the world in a faintly green LED glow. Her curtains had long since torn, and \nthere was nowhere to buy any more. When she turned onto her side, she \ncould see the blinds of the flat across the street twitching, the suggestion of an \nobserver between the slats. Carmen turned her back to the window, tried to \nignore the sense that she was being watched, being judged. Her own eyes \ndrifted to the door to her room, and she realised it was ajar. \n[The creak of a door and someone moving throughout] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nIn the gap stood her flatmate, the one whose name Carmen didn’t remember, \nand who she couldn’t recall moving in. Straight blonde hair atop a round, \nfriendly face that never seemed to blink. \n‘It’s late,’ the flatmate said, her tone level. Carmen’s throat tightened. ‘I am \ntrying to sleep. This is not acceptable.’ \nThe words bit into Carmen and she felt her head swim and her heart race so \nfast she thought it was going to burst. What time was it? She hadn’t been \nmaking any noise, how had her flatmate known? This was her room, her space, \nshe was allowed to be awake, she was—", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 2, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 3664}}
