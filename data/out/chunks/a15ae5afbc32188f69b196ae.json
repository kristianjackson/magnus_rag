He gripped the \nhandle and with a single, easy motion, flung it open. The driver saw what was \nhappening and started to lunge to grab him, but it was too late. The old man \nturned back for just a second, looked me in the eyes and gave me a huge, \ntheatrical wink. Then he fell backwards, out of the car, and was gone to the \nswirling air beyond. \nThe driver shouted something and my mother let out a shriek, but the sounds \ndisappeared into the muted skies surrounding us. The driver was back on the \nphone, desperately trying to get someone on the other end, as the door just \nhung there, open to the nothingness beyond the car. I wanted to act, to help, \nto do something, but I was pinned to my seat with a confused fear. Then, \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 124 – Left Hanging \n7 \n \nwithout warning, and without any input from the driver, the car began to move \nagain. It travelled upwards, gaining speed, and swinging with such force, I was \nafraid we’d all be thrown out of the open door. \nOne minute. Two minutes. Three minutes. We should have hit another tower, \nor the top of the mountain, by now, but we just kept going, higher and higher, \nthe clouds surrounding us tighter, flowing in through the open door. My mind \nhad all but seized up and I felt helpless to do anything but watch as events \nprogressed. \nI don’t know how long we climbed before the car stopped again. Mum was \ncrouched on the floor now, gripping the handlebars above her for stability, and \nthe driver was trying to get any response from the controls. The brakes finally \nstarted again with such grinding force that we must have pitched almost forty-\nfive degrees forward, then back again, then forward. I could feel nausea wash \nover me as I was almost thrown forward onto the floor. Then everything was \nstill again, save for the gentle swaying. \nThe car remained in place for some time. I think we were all just waiting for \nwhatever was coming next. None of us spoke and, looking over at Mum, I \ncould see my own fear mirrored across her face. After a while, when \neverything had calmed down, the driver looked over to us. We were all quiet, \nafraid I think of breaking the stillness we found ourselves in, but I saw him start \nto edge towards the door. I knew what he was trying to do. He wanted to close \nit, lock it back in place and get some semblance of control back. I wanted to tell \nhim to stop, to warn him about whatever was about to happen, because I \nknew something was about to happen. But I could only stare at him as he \nslowly, achingly crawled towards his doom. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 124 – Left Hanging \n8 \n \nSure enough, as he approached the opening, his hand just starting to reach out \ninto the mist, I heard something on the cable that stretched out behind us. I \ndidn’t turn around, but I could hear the rhythmic, scraping sounds of \nsomething crawling rapidly towards us. I saw Mum’s eyes focus on something \nbehind my head and she screamed. It was a sound I’d never heard her make in \nmy whole life, and one that I will never forget. There was a thump from above, \nthe sound of something heavy landing on the roof of the car, and the driver \nfroze, arm still outstretched. His eyes widened in sudden realisation, but \nbefore he could pull back from the edge, an arm, long, grey and completely \ninhuman, reached down from above with terrible speed. It grabbed his wrist, \njust for a moment, and then he was gone, his own scream vanishing into the \nabyss beyond the door. \nIn the quiet that followed, Mum and I just stared at each other, neither of us \nknowing what we could do except wait for whatever fate was squatting on top \nof the cable car. Then came three bangs, one after another, on the roof of the \ncar. Knock, knock, knock. Then a laugh. A terrible, whistling sound like the \nhowling of a gale. And then… \nI don’t know when I noticed the green light on the control panel, the one next \nto the button the driver had held when we first started the journey. It certainly \nhadn’t been lit the last time we were moving, maybe not since the first time \nwe stopped. I couldn’t afford to let hope come into my heart, I knew that \nwould be too cruel, but I also knew I couldn’t ignore it. \nI finally, painfully stood up. My whole body was shaking so violently I thought I \nwould collapse before I’d even taken my first step, but little by little I inched \nmy way towards it, never taking my eyes off the green light.
