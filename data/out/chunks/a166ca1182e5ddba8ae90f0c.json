Mr Bouchard was \nmissing. So many friends and colleagues dead. The violence, the gunshots. The \nold man and his... daughter? Their murderous joy. She couldn’t stop thinking \nabout their faces. How they had looked right past her as they ran through the \nbuilding. \nOver now, of course. Weeks ago. Too early to forget but too late to act. Wasn’t \nthat always the way? Her flat was empty and silent. All her friends and family \nnow so distant as to be almost strangers. What else could she have done \nexcept come in to work? She didn’t know who for or why. She had simply sat at \nher desk and waited for the phone to ring. She waited and she waited. \n[Long building creak] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 192 – An Appointment \n \n26 \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nAnd it got dark. And it got light. Over and over, and still she waited. All she \nknew was that something still needed to happen. And she couldn’t bring \nherself to leave until she knew what it was. \n[Building creaks grow, metal starts to warp; until it sounds like the \nbuilding is part of an earthquake] \n[The sounds of people screaming] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nNot until the sky began to change, and the screaming began. And Mr Bouchard \nreturned to his office. By then it was too late. In many ways it felt like it had \nalways been too late. \n[Hissing static starts] \n[The building transformation sounds are replaced by the echoes of \nthe large space they had entered; the faint pulsing tone continues; \nthe Archivist’s voice has reverb when he speaks] \nARCHIVIST \nS-sorry. \n[Hissing static becomes fainter] \n[Footsteps as Rosie approaches] \nMARTIN \n(Softly) Oh Rosie… \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 192 – An Appointment \n \n27 \nROSIE \nMr Sims, was it? \nARCHIVIST \nUh, yes? \nROSIE \nI believe you have an appointment. Mr Magnus is waiting just inside. \nARCHIVIST \nOh. Right. \n[The three walk] \nMARTIN \nIs there anything we can do to help her? \nARCHIVIST \nIf there is, it’s on the other side of these doors. \nROSIE \nHead right on in, he’s ready for you. \nMARTIN \nOkay. \n[Martin and the Archivist walk forward; smooth sliding door sounds \nas the door responds; as it opens, the sound of Jonah’s distorted \nvoice fills the room] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 192 – An Appointment \n \n28 \n[In the background, swirling air and paper can be heard; an \nunpleasant shifting tone; and the pulse is stronger] \n[Hissing static ends] \n[Jonah’s speech underscores the rest of the conversation, an \nunbreaking narrative of fear as he floats and writhes in perpetual \nperception] \n[Every noise here reverberates similar to a vast domed church] \nJONAH (BACKGROUND) \n—he screams his pitch is low and black as night that flows and chokes his \nwithered throat and hacking cough that sounds like death is here for him who \nalways knew and feared that this indecent end would carve its bitter name full \ndeep inside his soul and burn within without a ceasing seeing moment more \nthan screaming ones who howl and hide from fates that crawl towards on nails \nthat scratch and creak like rotten boards might warn you of your severed pains \napproach to pull your skin like sodden cloth and drag it tearing from the now \nthat is no longer even close to what the when just might have been if there \nwas time enough to run and hide from rancid deaths— \n[Martin and the Archivist walk further into the room; the doors \nslide closed] \nARCHIVIST \n(Aghast) No... \nMARTIN \nC-can he hear us? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 192 – An Appointment \n \n29 \nARCHIVIST \nI… \nMARTIN \nDoes he even know we’re here? \nARCHIVIST \nI don’t... \nMARTIN \n(Calling) Elias! \nJonah, Jonah Magnus! \nOi! Dickhead! Come down here so we can kick your arse! \nARCHIVIST \n(Sadly) He can’t hear you, Martin. \nMARTIN \nYeah I got that. What’s wrong with him? \nARCHIVIST \nNothing. Nothing’s wrong with him. \nHe’s the pupil of The Eye. \nMARTIN \nMeaning?", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 7, "chunk_count": 9, "chars": 3850}}
