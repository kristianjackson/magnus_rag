He was tall, but I couldn’t \nsay much more than that. \nHis body was hidden in the folds of a robe of some sort. It was the same colour \nas the dust that had filled the air and seemed to move and shift in the same \nway. His white hair was thin and wild, covering an unkempt face and a scraggly \nbeard. His eyes were milky white. I think he was blind. From the description \nthe sergeant had given us, I was sure this was Maxwell Rayner. \nNext to him was an old chair that looked like it could have come from a dinner \ntable. The wood was stained, covered in dark mould, and tied to it with thin \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG073 – Police Lights \n9 \n \nmetal wire was Callum Brodie. The kid's eyes were blank, though not clouded \nlike the old man’s, and his face was locked in a silent scream. \nRayner was facing him, thin, bony hands raised to his face. Something was... \nsomething was flowing out of his mouth. It looked like ink, but it flowed more \nlike a heavy fog than any sort of liquid. It drips down his forearms and onto the \nfloor, where it... it rolled towards Callum, climbing up the chair and oozing \nacross the boy's body towards his face. It was moving slowly, and had just \nreached his chest. The roaring sound seemed to come as it convulsed out of \nthe old man’s mouth. \nThen Goodman opened fire. The muzzle flash seemed impossibly bright as it \ncut through the dark and... I could swear that, for a second, the room it lit up \nwas not a basement but a cathedral. He let off three shots in a quick burst, and \nevery one of them hit Rayner square in the chest. His robe twitched violently \nas he staggered backwards, and all the dark liquid suddenly washed down onto \nthe floor in a single movement, leaving Callum untouched. It still gushed from \nhis mouth, though, and as the shots tore through him he spun about and an \narc of the dark substance flew through the air. \nAltman had started running towards them as soon as he had seen the kid, and \nwas almost at the chair when the wave of it spewed out. A few droplets hit him \non the cheek and he started to howl and claw at his face. Goodman fired again \nat Rayner, dropping him to the ground, and the horrendous noise stopped \nsuddenly, leaving only Leo’s cries of pain. The lights came on all at once, and in \nthe sudden painful brightness none of us had time to do anything as a woman \nwho hadn’t been there a moment ago ran up to Leo. She wore a robe similar to \nthe old man’s, and by the time any of us had seen the knife in her hand she \nhad buried it in Altman’s throat. More gunshots, this time from the officer who \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG073 – Police Lights \n10 \n \nhad partnered with Leo, but she was too slow. By the time the woman with the \nknife had been dropped, he was already bleeding out on the floor. \nFive seconds. Two dead kidnappers, one dead police officer... and silence. We \nwere standing in a small basement room lit by dingy fluorescent bulbs, no sign \nof the black liquid or any sort of dust. The kid seemed fine. I mean, I'm sure \nhe’ll need a lot of counselling, but he didn’t seem physically any worse for \nwear. Goodman went to untie him while I ran to check on Altman. It was too \nlate, of course, but as I looked at his still, cold face, I saw his eyes were a milky \nwhite. \nThe rest of the squad arrived a few seconds later and helped to take us back \nout to the van. After that it was all questions, debrief cups of coffee I never \nquite got around to drinking. And Section 31 forms. \nLots of them. \nAll in all there were five people killed in that building, including Leo Altman. \nAside from Rayner and the woman, who was identified from an old report as \nNatalie Ennis, two more were shot and killed when they attacked some of the \nother officers. Three more were subdued and arrested, but as far as I know \nthey still haven’t said a word. God knows how they’re going to process them \nwith all the secrecy around the operation, but thankfully that’s not my \nproblem. I think they were connected to that cult group from way back, the \nChurch of the Divine whatever. \nARCHIVIST \nThe People’s Church of the Divine Host. Rayner was their leader back in the \nearly Nineties. I have a few statements related to them if you're interested. \nNatalie Ennis was actually one of the...", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 4, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 4382}}
