The Magnus Archives. Episode one hundred and ninety-\nsix: \"This Old House.\" \n[Theme finishes] \n[Tape clicks on] \n[Footsteps on pavement walk steadily, accompanied by a few \ntweeting birds] \nANNABELLE \nAre you going to walk this slow the whole way? \nMARTIN \nAre you going to stay silent the whole way? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 196 – This Old House \n \n2 \nANNABELLE \nPerhaps that’s because you didn’t seem to like what I had to say. \nMARTIN \nNo, it’s because you weren’t really saying anything, were you? It was all just \nominous foreshadowing again. \nANNABELLE \nPerhaps I was just trying to make things feel… familiar? \nMARTIN \nPerhaps the whole ‘answer a question with a question’ thing is wearing a bit \nthin. Besides which it’s a bit late to play coy. You promised me an actual \nstraight answer. \nANNABELLE \nYou’d have it a lot more quickly if you didn’t keep stopping. \nMARTIN \nHey, this is your magic bubble. You’re the one making it so that we’re, like, \nactually walking walking all the way to Oxford. So sorry I’ve got to sit down \noccasionally, like a human. \nANNABELLE \nAnd the book breaks? \nMARTIN \nIt’s not like you’re entertaining company. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 196 – This Old House \n \n3 \nANNABELLE \nAnd it’s nothing to do with the fact that any lost souls in our area also get a \nbreak from their torment? Hmmm? \n(Beat) \nMARTIN \nSo what if it does? Is that a problem? \nANNABELLE \nActually, I find it very reassuring. \nMARTIN \nGreat, because I’m still going to need to rest. Some of these houses have actual \nbeds, and I haven’t slept on a mattress since Sa— \n[Footsteps slow, then stop] \nMARTIN (CONT’D) \nHmm. \nANNABELLE \nProblem? \n(Beat) \nMARTIN \nDid he suffer? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 196 – This Old House \n \n4 \nANNABELLE \nDid who suffer? \nMARTIN \nJust… answer the question. \n(Beat) \nANNABELLE \nNo. \nI did it in his sleep. \nHe’d always been accommodating, so... I wanted to honour his wishes. \nMARTIN \nThat’s a shame. \nANNABELLE \n(Firm) Is it? \nMARTIN \nI mean... he seemed nice. To us at least. \nANNABELLE \nAnd what of his victims? The people whose lives he destroyed? \n(Beat) \nMARTIN \nI can’t speak for them. I didn’t know them, did I? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 196 – This Old House \n \n5 \nANNABELLE \nNo. You didn’t. \n[Footsteps resume] \n(Beat) \nMARTIN \n(Sighs) Is it much further? \nANNABELLE \nLess so than last time you asked. \nMARTIN \nCould you just try answering a question properly? Just once? \nANNABELLE \n…We’re close now. Just a few more streets. \nMARTIN \nThank you. \n…Oh. Uhh... Huh. Um… \nANNABELLE \nOh come on, Martin. You didn’t really expect him to find us before we got \nhere, did you? \nMARTIN \n(Unconvincing) N… no... \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 196 – This Old House \n \n6 \nANNABELLE \nWe have a sizable lead, and the camera too, don’t forget. Besides, even if he \ndid ‘ride to your rescue’, what then? Would you explain to him that you’re \nhere of your own free will? \nMARTIN \nI mean, that’s a pretty generous way to describe being blackmailed. \nANNABELLE \nOh, it’s blackmail, is it? Offering you a way out of all this? \nMARTIN \nYou said if I told John or waited then you’d leave, and I’d never know. \nANNABELLE \nAnd you believed me, which was very gracious of you. \nMARTIN \n(Sputters slightly) I shouldn’t have. \nANNABELLE \nWhy not? I didn’t lie to you, I do have another option for you. One that means \nneither of you need to die or be consumed by any dark power. \nMARTIN \nOh, but you can’t just tell me or John. Oh no, no, that would be far too \nstraightforward.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 0, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 3917}}
