Which leads me to wonder if maybe \nhe didn’t want to let her go, either. I mean… maybe he, um… \nOh, er, h-hold on. \n(Away from the microphone) Er, excuse me? Excuse me! \n[The door opens.] \nMELANIE \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG084 – Possessive \n10 \n \nOh, yes, hello? \nMARTIN \nThis is… The Archives aren’t actually open to the public. \nMELANIE \nEr, I know. There, there wasn’t anyone on the door, though. I’m… I’m looking \nfor the Archivist? \nMARTIN \nAh. You’re Miss, er… Richardson? \nMELANIE \nKing. \nMARTIN \nKing! Yes. Right. \nMELANIE \nMelanie is fine. Is he here? \nMARTIN \nAre, are… Oh, are you alright? \nMELANIE \nOh, um, no. Not really. Got shot. Sort of. In India. \nMARTIN \nWhat? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG084 – Possessive \n11 \n \nMELANIE \nOh, it’s, it’s mostly fine now. I can walk on it, at least… It’s what I wanted to \ntalk to John about. \nMARTIN \nThat’s… not really… I mean, I guess I could take your statement? \nMELANIE \nOh. Er. I suppose. You mean, you mean now? Right. \n[The door closes.] \nUm, well… I… I flew out and I’ve been, well, that is, before that I was, I was \nlooking at some books. Er, there were history books that were talking… Look, \nare you sure I can’t just talk to John? You know, Jonathan Sims? He still works \nhere, right? \nMARTIN \nEr, that’s actually quite a good question. \nMELANIE \nOh, okay. Look, I’m sorry, I’ve… I’ve obviously missed something here. What’s \ngoing on? \nMARTIN \n(Sigh) John’s missing. And they… they think he killed someone. \nMELANIE \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG084 – Possessive \n12 \n \n(Laughs) What, he finally snapped, did he? Or did he accidentally bore them to \ndeath? \nMARTIN \nI’m serious. \nMELANIE \nOh. Oh right. So, who’d he kill? \nMARTIN \nHe didn’t! It’s just everyone – Look, it was, it was an old man. No-one here \nknows him, and the police still can’t actually identify the body, so… \nMELANIE \nSo… what? He’s supposed to have suddenly just murdered some stranger? \nMARTIN \nWith a pipe. \nMELANIE \nWhat, like burned him to death, or…? \nMARTIN \nA metal pipe. \nMELANIE \nOh! Sorry, I just pictured him with like a smoking… y’know? I mean, that, that \ndoesn’t sound like him, does it? I’ve only met him a couple of times, but \nbeating an old man to death with a pipe seems kind of out of character. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG084 – Possessive \n13 \n \nMARTIN \nRight? But everyone just seems totally convinced he did it. I mean, they think \nhe did something to Sasha too. \nMELANIE \nJesus. Which one? \nMARTIN \nOh, uh, she was, um, another one of the research assistants, like me and Tim. \nMELANIE \nYes, I know that, I meant – \nMARTIN \nShe vanished around the same time as the murder, I think. \nMELANIE \nOh, you know what, I am not doing this again. \nMARTIN \nYou sure you’re alright? \nMELANIE \nYes! I just got… God, I’m kind of at the end, you know? \nMARTIN \nThe end of what? \nMELANIE \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG084 – Possessive \n14 \n \nEverything. Friends, clues, savings. Everything. Options. There’s nowhere left \nfor me to go. I don’t know why, but… I just, I just felt that perhaps coming here \nmight help. And talking things out with John. I mean, I mean he’s awful, but at \nleast he listens, you know? \nMARTIN \nYeah. I’m… sorry. Um, is there anything that I could, like, maybe do for you? \n[The door opens] \nELIAS \nA friend of yours? \nMARTIN \nOh, er, it’s okay. She’s, um, er, she’s giving a statement. \nELIAS \nI see. Well, good to meet you. Elias Bouchard, I run the Institute. \nMELANIE \nMelanie King. \nELIAS \nAh, you’re not the Melanie King who runs Ghost Hunt UK, surely? \nMELANIE \nUsed to. \nELIAS \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG084 – Possessive \n15 \n \nAh, of course. My apologies. \nMARTIN \nYou used to watch it? \nELIAS \nI’m sorry to hear it’s no longer running. Your techniques were rudimentary, but \nyou showed surprising promise. On occasion. \nMELANIE \nThank you… I think. \nMARTIN \nMelanie was actually just leaving. Erm, I think we were done. \nMELANIE \nUh, yes… yes. \nELIAS \nOne moment, Miss King. Martin has filled you in on recent events, I believe? \nMELANIE \nI mean, a, a bit. \nMARTIN \nNot everything. \nELIAS \nThen you are aware there is currently a vacancy for an archival assistant?", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 4, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 4163}}
