It shows that Breekon and Hope didn’t own the company, I \nguess. That those aren’t their real names. It does seem to confirm that they \nhave some connection to the Circus, judging by clandestine meetings with \nsomeone apparently dressed as a ringmaster – as if it’s not obvious if you’re \ndressed as a ringmaster! And their apparent Russian origins. I say ‘origins’, \nperhaps… perhaps it’s just the last link in a very long chain. If the Circus is \nconnected as closely to the Stranger and the Unknowing as I believe, I should \nprobably keep an eye out for delivery vans. \n\nThe other useful thing I found here was one of the old log books. It lists \ndeliveries quite a ways past the point where the company technically ceased to \nexist, right up to 2013. I need to go through it in more detail, but probably not \nhere. This place… this place is done with its story. \nIt’s just… empty. \nI don’t like it. \n[Tape clicks off. Tape clicks on. There are sounds of a struggle.] \nSARAH \nWho the hell are you people? Let me go! \n[The click of handcuffs.] \nDAISY \nLike I said, you’re under arrest. \nSARAH \nWhat for? \nDAISY \nShut up. I’ve— \n(Exasperated) You’re recording again? \nARCHIVIST \nWhat? It’s hardly your first crime on tape, and if we’re going to question her... \nDAISY \n\nIs that what we’re doing? \nSARAH \nYou’re making a mistake, is what you’re doing. \nARCHIVIST \nOhhh… You thought we were going to, er, y’know, kill her. \nDAISY \nEl-Elias didn’t say. \nARCHIVIST \nNo, he doesn’t, uh... He’s not big on micromanagement. \nSARAH \nIt’s Elias now, then? \nARCHIVIST \n(Confused) What? \nDAISY \nGet on with it. \nARCHIVIST \nNot a fan of taxidermy? \nDAISY \nDon’t like wasting time. \n\nSARAH \nLast chance. \nARCHIVIST \nI… I really don’t want to be interrogating her where those... a-animals can see \nus. \nDAISY \nThey’re dead. They can’t see us. \n(Sarah snorts) \nARCHIVIST \nYeah, it would just be a bad idea. (Deep breath) What’s your name? \nSARAH \nSarah Baldwin. \nARCHIVIST \nAre you the same Sarah Baldwin that disappeared in Edinburgh in August \n2006? \nSARAH \nSome of her. Skin. A few memories. Not on the inside. \nDAISY \nHand us that knife, and I can check. Smells rank enough already. \n\nARCHIVIST \nNo, not… not yet. Did you go as part of a filming expedition to the Cambridge \nMilitary Hospital? \nSARAH \nA mistake. Thought I’d have fun with some over-curious idiots, but it turned \nout I had trespassed. I paid for it. \nARCHIVIST \nSo, what, now you sell dead animals? What is this place? \nSARAH \nThe Trophy Room. A taxidermist shop in Barnet. It says above the door. \nSurprised to meet an Archivist who can’t read. \nARCHIVIST \nNo, I— \nDAISY \n(Laughing.) Nice. \nARCHIVIST \nWhy are you here? You and Daniel Rawlings and, I assume the others taken by \nthat… mimic thing. The anglerfish. \nSARAH \nIt's where we were told to be. \n\nARCHIVIST \nWhat is it? The thing that stole you? \nSARAH \nIt doesn’t have a name. \nARCHIVIST \nWhat did it do to you? \nSARAH \nExactly what you think. (Pause) They always suffer. \nDAISY \nHow do we kill it? \nSARAH \n(Laughs) You don’t. \nARCHIVIST \nThere are, er… there, there are dozens of deliveries recorded here by Breekon \nand Hope. What were they delivering? What is the significance of this place? \nSARAH \nNothing, except what people give it. But they give it a lot, make it a place of \npower for us. Enough to keep certain items here. The couriers brought them, \nand took them, and moved them where they needed to be. \nARCHIVIST \n\nWhat items? What was stored here? \nSARAH \nBooks, relics, but nothing since the skin. \nARCHIVIST \nThe... The skin. The, er… The ancient taxidermy. The-The one that, erm... \nScaplehorn. The one he saw. \nSARAH \nI-I don’t know who that is. \nARCHIVIST \nHe was a-a tax inspector. He came here, and Daniel Rawlings, or his \nreplacement, showed him something he claimed to be the oldest piece of \ntaxidermy in the world. Gorilla skin from Carthage. \nSARAH \nWas this when you sent your ‘Sasha’ to interrogate us? \nARCHIVIST \nDon’t you dare talk about— \nDAISY \nSims. Sims. Shut up and focus. \nARCHIVIST \nRight.
