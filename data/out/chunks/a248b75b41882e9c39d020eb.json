It's the, um… \nBASIRA \nDesign of Millbank prison, based on an all-seeing watchtower. I know. I did the \nreading. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 158 – Panopticon \n \n17 \nARCHIVIST \nR-right. \nBASIRA \nYou think that's the device? \nARCHIVIST \nAh yes. And I'd wager that Elias' body— \nBASIRA \nGotta be Jonah Magnus, right? \nARCHIVIST \nI'd say so. \nBASIRA \n(Sigh) And he's been body hopping like whatever was in Reynor. \nARCHIVIST \nSo is he going to help Peter or-or stop him? \nBASIRA \nLukas is planning to take over the panopticon. Can't imagine he wants that to \nhappen. \nARCHIVIST \nBut Elias put him in charge. That doesn't make any— what... Daisy are you—? \n[Muffled sounds of violence] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 158 – Panopticon \n \n18 \nDAISY \nShh! \n[Muffled gun shots ring out; distant female screams can be heard] \nARCHIVIST \nOh, no. \nBASIRA \nStay here, both of you. I'll check it out. \n[Tape clicks off] \n[Tape clicks on] \n[Faint sound of the Lonely static] \n[A large echoing space; the panopticon] \nPETER \nWhat are you doing here, Elias? \nELIAS \nOh, you needn't worry. Two against one? I couldn't stop you if I wanted to. I \njust wanted to be here at the end. Can a man not watch his own death? \nMARTIN \nWhat, wh-wh- what? What? How are you even here? \nELIAS \nWell— \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 158 – Panopticon \n \n19 \nPETER \nDon't let him distract you. \nELIAS \n(Faux-hurt) Peter. \nPETER \n(Cold) Elias. \nMARTIN \nBoth of you just, just shut up. Just give me a second to think. \nPETER \nOf course. You can take all the time in the world. \nELIAS \nCome now, Martin. I would have thought you'd jump at the chance to kill me. \nMARTIN \nThat's not... why wouldn't you help against the Extinction? \nELIAS \nBecause I'm a busy man. It has never been my top priority. \nMARTIN \nI don't believe you. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 158 – Panopticon \n \n20 \nELIAS \nThat really doesn't matter, I'm afraid. It's the only answer you're going to get. \nMARTIN \nIf I... \nIf I do kill you, will the others survive? \nPETER \n(Warning) Elias… \nELIAS \nCome now, Peter, it's a valid question. And you should have addressed it \nyourself, really. \nThe short answer, is I don't know, Martin. I guarantee it won't be pleasant for \nthem, but I honestly don't know if their ties to the Institute are quite as strong \nas I may have implied. You, at least should be insulated from the fallout by \nyour new allegiance. John... might be powerful enough to weather it. Melanie's \nwell out of it, so that just leaves Basira and Daisy. And the rest of the Institute, \nof course, and you can't tell me you care about them. \nMARTIN \n(Indignant) Wh— of course I do! \nELIAS \nDo you though? Do you really care about any of them? Or is that worrying just \nsimply an old reflex? \n(Beat) \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 158 – Panopticon \n \n21 \nGoodness. Peter has done his work well, hasn't he? Hm! No, the only choice I \nthink that matters is whether you want to kill me or not. \nMARTIN \nI do. (With humourless laugh) I really, really do. \nPETER \nThen do it, Martin. \n[Peter hands Martin the knife] \nPETER (CONT’D) \nWe're the same, you and I. We don't need anyone else. Watching from a \ndistance, that's always who you've been. Haven't you enjoyed it these last few \nmonths, drifting through the Archives unseen, unjudged? You'll like it in there. \nI promise. \nMARTIN \nYeah. \nYeah, I think I would. \nPETER \nThen do it. Kill him and help me (dramatically) save the world. \n(Long beat) \nMARTIN \nNo. \n[Tape clicks off] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 158 – Panopticon \n \n22 \n[Tape clicks on] \n[The quiet room; with muffled violence in the background] \nDAISY \n(Sighing) Well? \nBASIRA \nLooks like two people. An old guy and— \nDAISY \nA woman with a scar. \nARCHIVIST \nOh, god, now? Why now?! \nBASIRA \nIt's probably not a coincidence. From what I saw they've been toying with the \nrest of the Institute, but it won't be long until they're all dead or escaped. \nDAISY \nAnd then they're coming here. \nARCHIVIST \n(Under his breath) Right. Okay. \nBASIRA \nSet up by the door. Try and take them when they break through.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 3, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 4062}}
