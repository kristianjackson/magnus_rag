By who? \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nAmericans. \n \nSASHA \nAh. \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nAs far as I can tell there isn't a “correct” pronunciation. But they were originally \nnamed after the Greek muse Calliope, so... \n \nSASHA \nAre people going to understand that it’s from Greek mythology? \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nIf they're working for the Magnus Institute, then I would hope so. \n \nSASHA \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG024 – Strange Music \n7 \n \nI’ve just heard it more often as “ka-lee-o-pee”. \n[DOOR CLOSES] \nJONATHAN SIMS \nStatement continues. \nJONATHAN SIMS \n(Read aloud from the archived witness statement of Leanne Denikin) \nI went back to the calliope. There was no lock on the lid, or any switch that I \ncould see on the outside. I opened it, and the keys inside shone as though they \nhad just been polished. Now, at the time I didn't know how a calliope worked. I \njust thought it was like a weird pipe piano. I didn't know that there needed to \nbe a blower working for the thing to play, and even if I had I wouldn't have \nknown where to find one or how to use it. By rights, when I sat in front of it \nand pressed the first key down, nothing should have happened. The four tall \nrows of brass whistles should have remained silent. Instead, there came a loud, \nhowling tone from one of the pipes and I almost fell off my seat in surprise. I \nremember once, hearing the sound of a steam organ could be heard from over \na mile away, and when that shrill whistle sounded I could believe it. \nI started to play a tune. My grandpa had had a piano once. It had broken years \nbefore and he'd never had the money to replace it, but he had taught me the \nbasics. There was one tune that, when I was a child, I always insisted he play to \nme. He never told me its name, if it even had one. I always used to just call \n“Faster Faster”, by way of a description. A cheery, upbeat circus melody that \nstarted out almost unbearably slow and gathered in tempo, getting faster and \nfaster until my grandpa's fingers were a blur. He always indulged me when I \nasked him to play it, and now I played it for him. The wailing whistles were \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG024 – Strange Music \n8 \n \nalmost deafening in that cramped space. I knew I'd probably be hearing from \nthe neighbours about it, but I didn't care. I just played. \nThe tune got faster, more frantic, and I felt something building inside me. It \nwas like final closure for the loss of my grandpa was just out of reach, and if I \ngot faster, if I played with enough speed I could catch it. But my finger slipped \nand the music abruptly became a discordant cacophony. I never was as good as \nGrandpa Nick. I sat there in silence for a minute. When I turned to leave, \nthough, I saw that the old steamer trunk was open, and the clown doll lay on \ntop of the pile. Even though its painted eyes were still shut, I felt like it was \nlooking at me. Its smile seemed slightly wider than before. I shut the trunk and \nclimbed down the ladder. \nI didn't really think about the weird things in the loft over the next week or so. \nI had too much else to do. It was only when Josh was next round, and asked \nme why the small hole into the attic was open, that I remembered. I told him I \nhad something cool to show him, and got the ladder out. He was suitably \nimpressed by the calliope, but freaked out a bit over the dolls. I didn't realise \nhe was scared of them. He made me shut the steamer trunk almost as soon as \nhe saw them, and kept looking over to make sure it was closed. I decided not \nto tell him about the first time it had popped open. \nHe asked if I could play anything on the ancient steam organ, and so I sat down \nand began to play my grandpa's old circus tune. Again I began to pick up speed, \nto play faster and faster as the whistles began to shriek. I felt a hand touch \nmine firmly, abruptly stopping the music. Josh stood there, shaking slightly, his \nface deathly pale. On impulse I looked over to the chest of dolls, but the lid \nwas firmly shut. I asked him what was wrong and he said he didn't know.
