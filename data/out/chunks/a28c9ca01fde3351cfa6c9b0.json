Appropriately \nenough, Gertrude used fire. \nShe had some small knowledge of the truth of things when she first took the \nposition, enough knowledge to be dangerous, as the old saying goes, but also \nenough to be cautious, and it was leaning into this second inclination that kept \nher alive through those first few years. \nAngus Stacey had, in the long tradition of Institute Archivists, been a \ndisappointment to the man whose eyes then sat in the smirking face of one \nDirector Richard Mendelson. Angus had been too keen to learn, too ambitious \nin his academic legacy. He had had grand plans to revise Smirke's Fourteen, \nand, in trying to doing so, burned through his resources, his luck, and \nultimately all but one of his assistants.
