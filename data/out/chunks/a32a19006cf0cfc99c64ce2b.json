Andrew managed to lure Debbie into an ambush just \noutside my flat, of all places, even though I haven’t been back since the last \nMurder Club. Which, I rather think will have been the last Murder Club. \nAnd I was thinking, yesterday, how strange all this was. And it occurred to me \nthat, while it might seem ridiculous, maybe there was something supernatural \nabout all this. Maybe the chase isn’t as normal as it feels. Before we killed that \nman, I don’t think any of this would have felt right. So I thought I’d come and \ntalk to you, before it all comes to an end. So, sorry if Andrew or Ananya attack \nanyone here because they saw me come in. I don’t think they will, they’re \n\nusually pretty careful, but still. I think that’s all of it, really. I’m probably going \nto leave now, try to hunt down my friends. It’s weird, you know? I don’t \nremember feeling this way when we first set up Murder Club. But… I suppose \nat least we don’t have to change the name. \nBASIRA \nStatement ends. \nDamn. I remember this case. It was a bit before my time, but yeah. Six, um, \n‘friends’, they basically spent about two weeks murdering each other before \nthe last survivor was finally caught. \nAnanya Kaleka was apprehended just after she cut Lisa Carmel’s throat in an \nalleyway near East Croydon station. The way the other officers told it, she \nnever said a word except to plead guilty, and died in her cell a few months \nlater. Apparently, she just... stopped. \nI don’t know anything about any assailant in a mask, though. That’s not a part \nof the story I’ve ever heard before. You don’t get a great description in this \nstatement, but it might be worth checking missing persons for that period, \nchecking any violent offenders that might have disappear— \n[Knocking at the door] \n(Sighs) Come in, Daisy. \n[Door opens] \nDAISY \nYou done? \n\nBASIRA \nYeah, let’s go. \nDAISY \nNo need. \nBASIRA \nUm...? \nDAISY \nHe’s gone. Heading over to some storage unit. Says it’s important. \nBASIRA \nOh, so are we going to meet him there, or...? \nDAISY \nHe asked for someone to stay back, distract Elias a bit. I said we’d do it. \nBASIRA \nBoth of us? \nDAISY \nYeah. Couldn’t find Tim, but he’s gone with Martin and… the other one. \nBASIRA \nMelanie. \nDAISY \n\nSure. \nBASIRA \nI mean, it might be dangerous. \nDAISY \nThey’ll be fine. \nBASIRA \nIs... Is there something wrong, Daisy? \nDAISY \nNo. So… how’s your new job? Working a lot of overtime? \nBASIRA \nIt’s, uh... alright, I guess. Once you get used to constantly feeling like you’re \nbeing watched. Just a bit of low-level dread. Kinda peaceful. Been reading a lot. \nDAISY \nMmm. \nBASIRA \nHow about you? \nDAISY \nElias is keeping me busy. Hunting. Takes a while. I’m used to working with a \npartner. It’s fine. \n\nBASIRA \nDaisy... \nDAISY \nIt’s fine. \nBASIRA \nRight. But it’s not, though, is it? \nDAISY \nYou’re getting comfortable with all those books. Don’t forget why you’re here. \nBASIRA \nI know where I am, Daisy, and I know that I’m a prisoner. \nDAISY \nAnd you want to escape. \nBASIRA \nYeah. But not on my own. We're working on something. I'll ask Melanie to fill \nyou in. \nDAISY \nFine. \n… \nMaybe you could ask Elias if you can join me on a case? \n\n… \nBASIRA \nHow does it feel? \nDAISY \nWhat? \nBASIRA \nHow does it feel when you make a kill? \nDAISY \nI don’t know. Good. Why? \nBASIRA \nI don’t know, it doesn’t feel like... “the warm glow of an approving parent, \ntinged with a bloody sweetness”? \nDAISY \nDon’t. \nBASIRA \nWhat? \nDAISY \nI’m not one of your bloody puzzles. \nBASIRA \n\nI’m sorry. I just... I worry. \nDAISY \nWorry about yourself. I’m fine. \nBASIRA \nAre you sure? ‘Cause you look... Are you sleeping? \nDAISY \nYeah. Do you still have the dreams? \nBASIRA \nUm, no, not really. Not since we joined up here, I don’t think. You? \nDAISY \nYeah. \nBASIRA \nThey’re getting worse? \nDAISY \nNo, not, it’s just— Doesn’t matter. We need to decide what to do with Elias \nbefore the others get to Hainault. \nBASIRA \nDaisy. \nDAISY", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 4, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 3958}}
