Even then, I thought I was just looking at a very \nwell-done horror set piece, especially when I started to notice a handful of \nEnglish words popping into the wall of shifting text for a second or two at a \ntime. One of them read ‘‘helphelphelp’’, all run together, and another, “it peels \nmy mind like knives”. My mouth was dry and my hand was shaking, but even \nthen all I could think was how good this was. I was genuinely impressed by how \nunsettled it was making me. \nIt was the laptop’s fan that finally got me. I gradually realised that it wasn’t \nmaking its normal whirring sound anymore. It had changed into something \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 065 – Binary \n10 \n \nharsher, less healthy sounding, like it was desperately trying to expel air. It \nsounded like someone breathing out, diseased lungs pushing and straining and \n… and never stopping to take anything back in. It was only at that point that \nthe possibility of malaware really occurred to me. I didn’t know how it would \nmake my laptop fan sound like that, but my computer wasn’t acting right. I \ntried to exit the program and, predictably enough, it wouldn’t close. So I \ncrashed it, planning to have a look through in safe mode. Sure enough, the \nlights went dark and the groaning sounds of the fan died, but the white text on \nthe screen wasn’t going anywhere. \nNow that, I knew, was impossible. Well, maybe there might have been some \nway to keep it frozen on the screen when the computer turned off, but to have \nit keep changing and morphing when there was clearly no power running \nthrough it... well, if it’s possible, I don’t know how you do it. More words \npopped in and out of existence: “you wanted to talk” and ‘‘hihihihihi’’ over and \nover again. Then all at once the screen was filled with an image. It was grainy, \nlike a very early webcam. The camera appeared to be lying on a table, looking \nup at a balding man. He appeared to be in his late 30s, I thought, and was \nshirtless, with a face frozen in pain or distress. Then he moved and I realised I \nmust be watching a video file. The man was crying. There was no sound, but I \ncould see great, heaving sobs that sent his whole body shuddering. He stared \ninto a computer monitor, the edge of which I could just about see. He seemed \nto be sat in the dark and his face was solely illuminated by the screen in front \nof him. I watched with mounting dread as the video continued. \nHe reached down to what I assumed would have been the keyboard, but he \ndidn’t seem to be typing. Instead, there was a sudden jerking motion and he \nraised his hand to reveal one of the keys that he had apparently torn off. He", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 4, "chunk_count": 9, "chars": 2765}}
