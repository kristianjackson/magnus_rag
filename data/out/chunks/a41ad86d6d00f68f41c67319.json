I don’t \nknow if I have words for it. How can you describe being aware of the absence of \neverything? Life. Light. Warmth. It was very dark, and very cold. It dawned on me \nthat this might be my existence forever. There, beyond time, and I tried so \ndesperately to scream, but I had no lungs or throat in that dreadful place. I \ncouldn’t even cry. Then I was back in the light with such a sudden jolt that I found \nmyself trying to blink, even though I had no eyelids or even eyes. But I could still \nsee. \nI was standing in what seemed to be an operating theatre. Doctors and nurses in \nscrubs and masks buzzed around and through me, busy with something on the \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 155 – Cost of Living \n9 \n \nlong table in the center of the room. It didn’t take me long to realize that what \nthey were busy with was me. I didn’t look like myself, so bruised and discolored, \nwith a great gash on my forehead. Is it odd to say that this sight filled me with \nrelief? There was a sudden rush of realization. I wasn’t dead, I was having a near-\ndeath experience! I’d read about people having encounters almost exactly like \nthis one, and they had seemed fine. I might still be okay. I might live. Then I \nbecame aware of a long, steady droning sound, and my vision turned to the flat \nunmoving line on the heart rate monitor. The panic I felt before returned all at \nonce, but now focused, acute. I didn’t have any arms but still I tried to reach out, \nflailing towards the doctor who was leaning over my body, trying to restart my \nheart. And then I felt something. I felt myself reach into his chest, held the strong \nsteady beat of his heart. Calm. Calm while I was lying dead on the table. There \nwas a sudden moment of rage and hate that flowed out of me down at his torso, \nand he began to convulse. He staggered backwards from the table arms dropping \nto his side, struggling to speak. And I heard the drone of the monitor turning to a \nbeep. Beep. Beep. And I was gone. \nWhen I woke up I was lying in a hospital bed, very much alive although the faces \naround me were grave. I asked her what had happened, and one of the nurses \nvery kindly explained to me about the seizure, my fall, and what my recovery \nmight look like going forward. But I could tell she was holding something back, \nand after some pressing, she finally told me that the doctor who saved my life had \nsuffered a fatal heart attack while he was treating me. I didn’t tell her about what \nI saw, what I was trying to convince myself was a simple dream. A bizarre near-\ndeath experience. I couldn’t have killed him, it wasn’t possible. But there was no \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 155 – Cost of Living \n10 \n \npoint to putting that thought out into the world anyway. I just had to try and \nforget. \nMy recovery time was nothing short of miraculous. Within a couple of days I was \nout of the hospital, and my broken bones all seemed to be clean breaks that \nhealed very fast. In the end, we didn’t even need to delay the wedding and... \ndespite everything, it was perfect. The church was magnificent, the reception the \nmost fun I’ve had in years, and Daven was exactly the man I wanted to spend the \nrest of my life with. In lieu of gifts, we asked people to donate to a local children’s \ncharity, and they sent us a wonderful thank-you card. We honeymooned in the \nCaribbean, and everything was right with the world. \nIt was a year later that I slipped in the shower and cracked my head on the tap. I \nhadn’t had any further seizures, and in fact the doctors hadn’t be able to find any \ntrace of epilepsy in my scans at all. No, this was simply a freak accident. Could \nhave happened to anybody, but it happened to me. Again I found myself in that \ndark, cold place, and this time I simply waited, hoping against hope that this time, \nit wouldn’t be forever. And to my great relief, it wasn’t. Again I found myself \npresent over my own body, a severed presence watching as the water continued \nto beat down on my unmoving form. I was starting to develop a suspicion, a \nvague idea of what might be going on. There was no one else around. Daven was \non a business trip and I was alone in the house. I tried to move and I could. It \nalmost felt like walking though I had no legs to carry me. Unable to touch the \nbathroom door, I simply moved through it, then out into the world, looking for \nsomething I couldn’t quite name.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 2, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 4434}}
