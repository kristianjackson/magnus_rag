He knows that when Callum tells him what \nit is, then it will start to chase him. He won't see it, of course, because its just \ntoo dark. But he will know it's there. \nJack can't tell Callum to be quiet, though. Last time he did that, Callum put him \nin a hole for a very long time, and the next hole would certainly be full of all of \nCallum's nastiest monsters. And anyway, Callum is Jack's friend. And friends \ndon't tell each other to be quiet. \nSo Callum begins to tell Jack about a new monster. It lives down the drain and \npops up through the plughole when you're washing your hands and bites off all \nyour fingers one by one. The only way to stop it is to shine a torch down the \nhole. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 173 – Night Night \n16 \nBut there are no torches on Night Street. There are no lights at all. No way to \ncheck a drain or a shadow or a tree. Only monsters. And the dark. \nSo Jack begins to run. \nSee Kaitlyn. See Kaitlyn hide. See Kaitlyn hide in the dark, because everywhere \nis dark on Night Street. \nThis time, Kaitlyn is in her wardrobe. The door is closed all but a crack so she \ncan see into her bedroom. But the night light is out, and the room is pitch \nblack, and she can hear the monsters moving about. They are looking for her. \nThey snuffle and grunt and growl. They knock over her lamp and gut her cuddly \ntoys and talk to each other of whether they want to cook Kaitlyn into a stew or \nbarbecue her arms and legs. \nKaitlyn buries her face in her mother's old fur coat and she cries and she cries. \nHer mother is downstairs, but she is part of the sofa now. She won't stop \nstaring at the television and laughing. Laughing and laughing. She doesn't like it \nwhen Kaitlyn is awake. She doesn't hear it if she screams. \nThe monsters are getting closer. They have looked for her under the bed. They \nhave looked through her chest of drawers. They have climbed up all the \nbookshelves, and now they are moving towards the wardrobe. She cannot see \nthem, but their voices are sharp and mean and they come closer and closer \nand Kaitlyn is ever-so scared. \nKaitlyn read a picture book once, full of horrible spiky fish with big eyes and \ncrooked teeth. She would see them every time she went to bed for weeks. \nThat was what the monsters looked like, she was sure of it. They would grip \nher with their nasty cold fins and bite her head clean off. Kaitlyn could not hide \nfor long. It was very dark. But their big eyes would see her in no time. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 173 – Night Night \n17 \nShe is curled up in the corner of the wardrobe against a huge pile of scarves. \nWait. There's someone behind the pile! Kaitlyn can barely see, but it looks like \nCallum Brodie! What is he doing in her wardrobe? \nKaitlyn doesn't like Callum Brodie. He punches her in the arm sometimes and \ncalls her a baby, and he's always told her the monsters were going to get her. \nHe was a bully. \n\"Go away, Callum Brodie,\" Kaitlyn says. \"I'm trying to hide.\" \nCallum Brodie just smiles a big grin full of crooked teeth. \n\"She's in here!\" Callum Brodie shouts, loud enough for the whole street to \nhear. \nKaitlyn can hear the monsters coming towards the wardrobe. She pushes \nCallum Brodie back and opens the door. It is so dark outside that she can't see \nanything at all, but she runs and she runs and she runs, looking for another \nplace to hide. \nSee Kaitlyn hide. \n[Hissing static starts] \nARCHIVIST \n(Darkly) Is that enough for you? Do you need to hear more? \n[Hissing static fades, then gets loud again] \nSee Luka. See Luka sleep— \nMARTIN \nNo, no, no; that's enough! That's enough. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 173 – Night Night \n18 \n[Hissing static ends] \n(Beat) \n[A few steps] \nARCHIVIST \nThank you for not hitting me this time. \n(Martin takes some shaky breaths) \nWas that what you wanted? What you needed? \n(Beat) \nMARTIN \n(Upset) No. No, it didn't help at all. \nARCHIVIST \nI'm sorry. \nMARTIN \nLet's get out of here. \nARCHIVIST \nIf you're sure. \nMARTIN \nThe sooner we get back to the Archives, the sooner we can put a stop to this. \nAll of this. They just… (sighingly) They'll just need to hang on a little longer.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 3, "chunk_count": 5, "chars": 4142}}
