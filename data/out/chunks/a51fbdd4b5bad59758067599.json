Yes, actually! I’ve been reading a bunch of the old statements; he’s the \ncreepy boat captain, right? From that family Elias doesn’t want us bothering? \n \nMARTIN \nYeah, well, apparently that warning doesn’t go both ways. \n \nBASIRA \nHe was here? \n \nMARTIN \nYeah, I, I think so. \n \nBASIRA \nWas he ... \n \n(Basira makes spooky sound) \n \nMARTIN \nI mean, a bit, yeah. \n \nBASIRA \nOh. Oh dear. \n \nMARTIN \nMaybe? I don’t know. Honestly, he was just a bit ... weird. \n \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG108 – Monologue \n \n16 \n \nBASIRA \nYeah... Is that why you wanted me? \n \nMARTIN \nOh, no, I, uh ... are you busy? \n \nBASIRA \nA bit. I was reading through a bunch of stuff about the Church of the Divine \nHost. Did you look into that statement about the chapel in Hither Green? \nBecause apparently right around that time there was a full solar eclipse going \non in, guess where. \n \nMARTIN \nI, uh, I don’t know. \n \nBASIRA \nNy-Ålesund! And when Natalie Ennis talked about it being 300 years, well, how \nmuch do you know about the relationship between Edmond Halley and John \nFlamsteed? \n \nMARTIN \nHalley like the comet? \n \nBASIRA \nExactly. \n \nMARTIN \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG108 – Monologue \n \n17 \n \nLook, Basira, that’s really interesting, but that’s not why— Look, you’re close to \nMelanie, right? \n \nBASIRA \nUh, I guess so. Closer than anyone here, I think. \n \nMARTIN \nIs she … is she doing ok? \n \nBASIRA \n(Wary) Why? Did she say something? \n \nMARTIN \nNo, no, it’s just her work’s been ... Look, she’s always been quite, you know, \nconscientious. But then recently ... \n \nBASIRA \n(Lowering voice) Ok, look. I don’t know what the situation is. She won’t tell \nme. But she’s not doing well. We were meant to go for a drink last week, but … \nI think it has something to do with Elias. \n \nMARTIN \nElias? Oh, god. \n \nBASIRA \nYeah. \n \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG108 – Monologue \n \n18 \n \nMARTIN \nWell, well maybe we can— What? \n \nOh, right. \n \n(Click) \n \n[The Magnus Archives Theme - Outro] \n \nThe Magnus Archives is a podcast distributed by Rusty Quill and licensed under \na Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Sharealike 4.0 International \nlicence. \n \nToday’s episode was written by Jonathan Sims and directed by Alexander J \nNewall. \n \nIt featured: Alexander J Newall as Martin Blackwood, Alasdair Stuart as Peter \nLukas and Frank Voss as Basira Hussain.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 5, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 2578}}
