Of an entireness finally crossing the threshold into your self. So \necstatic was my completeness, I did not even hear my own door creak open. \nBecause Gertrude had told Michael how he could stop us. She told him to walk \nthrough a door. And even then, with so much of his mind shut down in panic \nand terror, he trusted her. And he went inside, closing the door behind him. \nBut Gertrude Robinson had given poor, disposable Michael one more thing \nbefore sending him to me. She had given him a map. I couldn’t say how she \nwould have gotten such a thing, or if she somehow made it. And yet it was a \n\nmap. A map to me. It made no sense, lines overlapping and inverting, but once \nwithin, Michael knew which turns to make, which doors to open, which mirrors \nto shatter. Until he became me. \nEven sharper than the joy of becoming is the agony of being opened and \nremade. To have your who torn bloody from your what, and another crudely \nlashed into its place. To become Michael. \nAnd to do so at such a crucial point in our Twisting, in our becoming, well of \ncourse it destroyed it. The impossible altar collapsed. The-Worker-of-Clay tore \nout his veins to dissolve himself in crimson mud. The others of us were cast to \nall the places that aren’t; some have still not found their way out again. And \nsomehow Gertrude Robinson was back on that boat before Sannikov Land \nonce again never existed. \nAnd all that was left was me. Michael. (Laughs) My very existence tied to my \npointlessness. \nWearing my failure as the very fabric of my being. Reduced once again to \nfeeding on the unsuspecting and confused. That is who I am. \nARCHIVIST \n(Intake of breath) But you... You never tried to take revenge on Gertrude? \nMICHAEL \nShe knew how to protect herself. She knew what she was creating. And killing \nher was not as important. She wasn’t as good an Archivist as you are. \nARCHIVIST \n\nSo why not kill me before? \nMICHAEL \nI had hoped that you would stop the Unknowing first, destroy the workings of \nI-Do-Not-Know You. But instead you are here, and may bring it about faster. So \nbetter your death happens now. \nARCHIVIST \nI— Is there anything I can do to stop you from killing me? \nMICHAEL \n(Laughs) If you scream loud enough the Circus may take notice of me, but… I \npromise you will die far more pleasantly with me than with them. \n(Laughs) Ah… \nARCHIVIST \nOkay \nMICHAEL \nGood. Right this way. \n[A door creaks] \nOpen it. Open it and this will all be over. \n[The sound of a handle turning, but the door doesn’t open.] \nARCHIVIST \nEr, it’s… \n\n[The handle is tried twice more] \nMICHAEL \nWhat? \nARCHIVIST \nIt’s locked. \nMICHAEL \nIt’s not. (Laughs) \nARCHIVIST \nWhy is it locked? \nMICHAEL \nIt can’t be! \nARCHIVIST \nWell, you try it! \n[The handle is tried again, more frantically. The door doesn’t open.] \nMICHAEL \n(Concerned) Th-Tha-That-That’s… not— \nOh. Oh no. \n(Michael screams for a long time, before it fades into nothing.) \n[The door creaks open.] \n\nHELEN \nDo you want to come in? \nARCHIVIST \nWh... Helen? H-Helen Richardson? But… But y— Michael... \nHELEN \nMichael isn’t me. Not now. \nARCHIVIST \nWhat happened? \nHELEN \nHe got... distracted. Let feelings that shouldn’t have been his overwhelm me. \nLost my way. \nARCHIVIST \nAnd now? Y— You’re Helen? \nHELEN \nI don’t know. I never know, not really. Do I need a name? \nARCHIVIST \nAh… No, I s-suppose not. \nHELEN \nHelen is... better than Michael. \n\nARCHIVIST \nBut she’s gone. \nHELEN \nYes. As is Michael. There’s only me. \nARCHIVIST \nI... Okay. \nHELEN \nDo you still want to leave here? \nARCHIVIST \nA-are you still going to kill me? \nHELEN \nNo. That was Michael’s desire, not mine. \nARCHIVIST \nSo… S-So what do you want? \nHELEN \nI don’t know. Helen liked you so… there’s a lot to consider. But I will help you \nleave. \nARCHIVIST \n\nWait, is this… Mic— Y-You’re the Distortion, the, the, the Liar. How do I know \nthis isn’t... a, a trick? \nHELEN \nAnd if it was, what would you do about it? \nARCHIVIST \n…Right. Right... \nHow long have I… b-been here? There’s no… It was hard to keep track— \nHELEN \nTime is hard, Archivist. It’s difficult to follow without a proper mind, especially \nhere. A while. \nARCHIVIST \nRight. \nHELEN \nThe door is open if you're ready? \nARCHIVIST \nNo, not, not really, but... \n(The Archivist sighs.) \n[Static. The tape clicks off.] \n[The Magnus Archives Theme – Outro]", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 3, "chunk_count": 5, "chars": 4435}}
