Yeah, y’know, y’know what? A little privacy would be nice sometimes, \nokay? Not everything’s for you! You don’t need to listen to everything that \nwe— \nAlright, you know what? Y’know what… If you’re that eager, fine. \nMartin Blackwood, Archival Assistant at the Magnus Institute, recording \nstatement number 8640514. Statement of Doctor Algernon Moss, given May \n14th 1864. \n(Clears throat) \nMARTIN (STATEMENT) \nMy story, such as is, should not be long in the telling, though there is much you \ncould understand of the circumstances surrounding it. I come to you not to \nwallow in my condition, or pour out my soul like a papist in the confessional, \n\nbut to request your assistance. I believe that Maxwell Rayner has at his \ndisposal some unholy power that he has used to curse me and cause my \nblindness. Or, more precisely, to cause me to blind myself, for I shall not deny I \ndid so willingly. For obvious reasons my accusations have had me laughed out \nof most polite society. \nNot quite so polite when you’re accusing someone of witchcraft, it would \nseem. I now ask the assistance of your Institute in the hopes that you may be \nable to furnish some evidence or legal precedent that may assist me in taking \naction against my assailant, though I will admit my expectations for the latter \nare limited. Maxwell Rayner is an oddity. He claims to be an antiquities dealer \nfrom Africa, and has, of late, become something of a darling in certain circles of \nCambridge, though I have never heard him discuss either antiquities or his \nsupposed homeland in any real detail. His passion appears to be polar \nexpeditions, and it’s rare to attend any social gathering with him where the \nsubject does not eventually come up. In particular he seems to share that \npeculiarly specific mania regarding the fate John Franklin and his lost \nexpedition. I would assume he was intending to accompany such a party \nhimself, were it not for the fact of his own blindness. Indeed, the spectacle of \nhis milky white eyes staring behind the weathered black skin of his face is an \nimage so striking that, were I to be uncharitable, I might suggest had \nsomething to do with the readiness with which he acquires invitations and \ncalling cards. He is led around by a young Arabian lad of ten or eleven, though \nthe ease with which he carries himself makes me suspect this assistance is an \naffectation rather than necessity. Both speak perfect English, with no accent I \ncan recognise, though the boy rarely opens his mouth other than to alert \nRayner of nearby goings-on. \nThe circumstances of our dispute are, by some margin, the least interesting \npart of my tale. I outbid him at an auction. It was nothing of note, so I \nassumed, though perhaps I should have considered his particular obsession. It \nwas an oilskin packet of documents, supposedly from the log-books of \nFranklin’s lost ship, the HMS Terror. I will admit a small amount of interest in \nthe matter myself, and my inclination turned to resolve when I saw how \ninsistently Rayner was bidding on it, and I prevailed. He approached me \nafterwards to discuss the matter and, perhaps if his tone had been less sharp, I", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 1, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 3216}}
