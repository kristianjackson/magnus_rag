The beige walls seemed dirtier than \nbefore, with dark marks at roughly hand-height. There was a faint buzzing, like \na fly, but I couldn’t see any source for it. \nNone of it was so bad as to make us turn back, however, and we headed \ntowards the reception desk. There was nobody behind it, and I rang the bell. I \nalways wore gloves when on a removal, and was glad of that fact now, as I \nnoticed a greasy residue on top of the small brass bell. The door to the \nreception opened, and a tall man stepped out. He was rail thin and wore a \nfaded brown suit that seemed to have been cut for a much fatter man. His \neyes were a watery blue and his dark hair stood on top of his head in an unruly \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG036 – Taken Ill \n7 \n \nmess. He must have been around forty, but had a nervous sort of energy to \nhim. He was quite a surprise, to say the least. \nJosh recovered faster than I did and asked the man, a bit rudely, who he was, \nwhere we could find Hannah. The man shook his head at this and said that Ms. \nRamirez had left the position, and he was now Director of Ivy Meadows. He \nintroduced himself as John Amherst, and held a hand out for Josh to shake. My \ncousin stood there for some time, staring at the thick, sweaty hand of this \nstrange man, clearly not wanting to shake it. Mr Amherst just stood there, arm \noutstretched, apparently unconcerned. A fly landed on his face, and if he \nnoticed, he didn’t give any sign of it, not even when it walked across his eye. \nEventually, the now clearly shaken Josh stuttered out some semi-polite excuse \nand backed away. \nAt this John Amherst lowered his hand and turned to me. He asked why we \nwere here. This took me rather by surprise, as there’s generally only one \nreason undertakers show up in such a place. We told him we had received a \ncall and been told Mr. Miller had passed away. Amherst asked who had called \nus, but with such a sharpness in his voice that I lied and said the caller hadn’t \ngiven their name. He paused, clearly considering what to say next very \ncarefully. Finally, he nodded, and said that yes, Bertrand Miller was dead. And \nwe could have him. Then he gestured for us to follow and began to walk back \ninto the main building. \nAs we walked, he began listing the details for Mr. Miller’s funeral, such as they \nwere. No family or friends, no savings or insurance, simple cremation, as soon \nas possible. No service to be held at the crematorium. Ashes to be returned to \nIvy Meadows in whatever the cheapest option was for an urn made of brass. At \nthis I asked what he wanted the ashes for, and he simply waved his hand in a \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG036 – Taken Ill \n8 \n \nvague dismissal and said they’d be wanting to have a “private remembrance \nservice”. \nBy now, we’d been walking for a few minutes, and I hadn’t seen another soul \nin the corridors. I thought I spotted one of the nurses at one point, but they \nhad turned and walked away as soon as they saw us. We arrived at a room \nbearing a small plaque. It read ‘Bertrand Miller’. John Amherst opened it \nwithout hesitation and went inside. \nThe smell was what hit me first. I’ve smelled plenty of corpses in my time. I’d \nalmost say I’m used to the smell. This was different, there was some deeper \ntaint there than simply putrefying flesh, and it made me gag. By the look on his \nface, Josh smelled it as well. Then I got a good look at the body on the bed, and \nalmost turned and ran. \nBased on the colour of those sections of skin still whole and unblemished, Mr. \nMiller couldn’t have been dead for more than a few hours, half a day at most. \nYou wouldn’t have known, though. Large sections of his body were covered in \na wet, creamy yellow rash, which... I’m not a doctor, so describing exactly what \nit did to the flesh it touched would serve no purpose except to start me having \nthe nightmares again. Let us just say that it gave a plentiful home for the flies \nthat swarmed around his body. \nWe looked at John Amherst, utterly appalled. He said not to worry, that the \ndisease that had claimed poor Mr. Miller wasn’t contagious. Even produced \nthe recently signed death certificate, though it was stained with some dark \ngrey fluid, so I did not examine it too closely. He then apologised that their air \nconditioning had broken. “I’m sure you know all about what heat does to \ncadavers,” he said.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 3, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 4427}}
