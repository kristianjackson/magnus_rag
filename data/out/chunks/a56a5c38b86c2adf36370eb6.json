I congratulated him on overcoming his fear before gently reminding \nhim that the reason we needed the phone was to call an ambulance. He \nnodded like he hadn't forgotten, and made the call. \nThe ambulance and hospital did pass in a bit of a blur. There was an X-ray, and \na lot more detail about the specifics of the break than I really thought was \nnecessary for the treatment instructions of “keep it in a cast and try not to \nmove it”. It was irritating, but it wasn't as if it was the first time I had broken a \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG075 – A Long Way Down \n7 \n \nbone. Time passed, I healed, and I forgot about the strange man who had \nwatched my brother almost fall. \nMy brother finally got another job shortly before Christmas, with Deloitte \nagain, though a different department, but he didn’t seem inclined to move out \nof the room in my house. He did offer to cover the rent for a few months, \nwhich I did appreciate, as paying it solo had wiped out a good deal of my \nsavings. It wasn’t like I had other housemates lining up to join me, so I resolved \nto make the best of it and live with his irritating habits. It was fine, you know. \nWe didn’t get on any better than we had when he was unemployed, but \nwithout the lingering resentment of money I could just about tolerate his \noccasional hygiene issues. And life rolled on. \nIt was about two months ago that I started planning for Paris. There was a \nconference I was due to speak at, and I hadn’t had a holiday since I broke up \nwith Carly, so I decided to take a full week there to really relax. I did not invite \nGrant, which you would have thought would make him think twice about \ncoming with me, but you’d be wrong. As soon as I mentioned it to him, he was \nonline checking if there were any more seats on my flight. There were. Then he \nkept bugging me to change my hotel booking to a twin room until I finally \nrelented and did so. Every time I mentioned something I was planning to do he \nwould invite himself along, generally getting me to arrange it and saying he’d \npay me back. I’m sure he intended to, and was just excited to spend some time \nhanging out in Paris, but at the start of October he lost his job again. \nHe had been caught smoking weed on company property. It hadn’t been on \nthe clock at the time, and he managed to talk them out of actually calling the \npolice, but he was dismissed on the spot and told in no uncertain terms that he \nwas not welcome to apply for any further vacancies. I imagine he wasn’t going \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG075 – A Long Way Down \n8 \n \nto get a reference, either. He was devastated, of course, and I will admit that I \nwasn’t as sympathetic as I could have been. From my point of view, it was his \nown damn fault; because of it I was suddenly on the hook for a reasonable \namount of money. It was clear that when we went to Paris I was going to have \nto pay for him, and he was so despondent that I didn’t have the heart to tell \nhim he couldn’t come. \nSo that’s why, when we went to Paris three weeks ago, I was both seriously \npissed at Grant, and in almost complete control of where we went while we \nwere there. I think that’s why I decided to take him up Tour Montparnasse. \nThere was no way I was going to get him up the Eiffel Tower, but I reckoned, \ncorrectly, that he wouldn’t have heard of the Tour Montparnasse, the actual \nhighest point in Paris accessible by the public. It just looked like a normal \nskyscraper, so I reckoned it probably wouldn’t ring any alarm bells for him until \nwe were actually in the lift. \nYou’ve got to understand I just wanted to freak him out a little bit. He’d have a \nbit of a panic, I’d pretend to have forgotten about his phobia, and we’d head \nback down with me feeling slightly avenged. \nI couldn’t have known. \nAt first it was all going exactly according to plan. I was vague about the \nattraction we were going to see, and he clearly hadn’t heard of the Tour \nMontparnasse, so he didn’t make any fuss when we went inside, even when \nwe first got into the elevator. As it started to rise, though, I saw the \napprehension start to creep across his face and he asked where the lift was \ntaking us. I had to fight to suppress a smile as I told him we were heading up to \nthe best view in Paris and his face started to drain of colour.
