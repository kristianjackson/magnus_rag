Episode one hundred and forty-\neight. Extended Surveillance. \n[Tape clicks on.] \n(Elias sighs.) \n[Door opens, then slams shut] \nELIAS \nGood evening, Detec— \n[Basira punches Elias.] \nBASIRA \nUseless, scheming piece of shit. \nELIAS \nDetective, this is quite unnecess— \n \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 148 – Extended Surveillance \n \n2 \n \n[Basira continues to hurt Elias.] \nBASIRA \nI’m sorry, was that unnecessary? \n[Basira hits Elias once more.] \nBASIRA (Cont.) \nBecause this is the most helpful you’ve been so far, unless you’ve got another \ncrisis for me? \nELIAS \nNo! No, no, it’s fine ... I’m sorry. \nBASIRA \nOh yeah? For which part? \nELIAS \nAll of it? \nBASIRA \nYou sent us to the North fucking Pole for no goddamn reason. \nELIAS \nA miscalculation. \nBASIRA \nNo. No, I’m done with your games. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 148 – Extended Surveillance \n \n3 \n \nELIAS \nLook, Basira— \nBASIRA \nAnd when, exactly, were you planning to tell us he’s been feeding on \ninnocents? \nELIAS \nI’ve always thought that a man’s eating habits were his own private business. \nELIAS \n(Conciliatory) But, I can see how maybe I should have mentioned it. \nBASIRA \nOr that we were being stalked by some freaky spider woman? Don’t tell me \nyou didn’t know about that. \nELIAS \nAh, yes. Well, to be honest, I’d advise you to leave that one well alone. \nBASIRA \nOh yeah? \nELIAS \nLook, I’ve been doing this a long time now, and if there’s one thing I’ve learned \nabout The Web, it’s that it plays its own game. All you can really do is hope it \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 148 – Extended Surveillance \n \n4 \n \ndoesn’t get in the way of whatever your plan is, because the Spider usually \nwins. Assuming you have a plan. Do you have a plan, Detective? \nBASIRA \nWhy do you do that? What is that? \nELIAS \nDo what? \nBASIRA \nYou always call me Detective. Is that supposed to mean something? \nELIAS \nHonestly? I just like the way it sounds. \nBASIRA \nSo, why’d you agree to see me? \nELIAS \nI missed you. \nBASIRA \nRight. That’s why you’ve been refusing my visits since we got back? \nELIAS \nI thought it might have been an idea to give you some space. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 148 – Extended Surveillance \n \n5 \n \nBASIRA \nOh, and how’d that work out for you? \nELIAS \nNot ideally. \nBASIRA \nSo, what now? Another wild goose chase? More gloating about John’s \n‘destiny’? Because right now, I’m having a real hard time figuring out why I \nshouldn’t just tell them to throw your little deal right out the window, and see \nhow you do in here without special treatment. \nELIAS \nI mean, you have plenty of reasons to do that, of course, but I’m not sure that \nthey have any reason to listen to you. \nBASIRA \nI’ll make them listen. \nELIAS \nWill you? You’re not police anymore. You’ve done them some favours, but \nthey’ve done you some as well, and I think you’ll find that the information that \nI’ve been giving to them has been far more consistently useful. You want to \nissue them an ultimatum? Go right ahead. I’m just not sure it’ll go quite how \nyou hope. \n… \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 148 – Extended Surveillance \n \n6 \n \nAnd, um, no more violence, Detective, or I may have to call in the guards. \nBASIRA \nSo that’s it, then. \nELIAS \nAs far as I can tell, you have no interest in anything I have to say and mainly \ncame here to let off steam. So yes, that’s probably it. \nBASIRA \nSurprised you didn’t foresee it. \nELIAS \nWell, that’s always been my problem: ever the optimist. \nBASIRA \nYou know, when you have no more useful information, and they’re done with \nyou … \nELIAS \nYou’ll kill me, yes. I’m sorry to say, Detective, but you’re becoming predictable. \n(Basira makes a noise of disgust.) \nELIAS (Cont.) \nGoodbye, Detective. I shall miss our little chats. \n[Tape clicks off. Tape clicks on.] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 148 – Extended Surveillance \n \n7 \n \nARCHIVIST \nWell? \nBASIRA \nJust useless gloating, like I said he would. \nARCHIVIST \nYou should have let me come with. \nBASIRA \nNo. Besides, he wouldn’t have seen me if I had. \nARCHIVIST \nCan’t believe you’ve been seeing him all this time. \nBASIRA \nOh yeah, that’s the terrible secret sabotaging the trust between us. \nARCHIVIST \nDid he mention it at all? My, uh … \nBASIRA \nOh, your new diet? Nothing useful. Didn’t seem too phased by it. \nARCHIVIST \n(Sighs) Right.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 0, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 4494}}
