Its position on what was then marshlands hardly helped, with \nsickness and disease rife within their walls. \nIt was a huge complex, covering much of what we now call Chelsea, but when \nit was finally closed in 1890, it was demolished. Flattened. Which meant that \nwhat I was in now couldn’t be the old prison itself. It had to be something built \nbelow it. And it was this that gave me such pause when I found the first set of \nsteps leading even further down. \nThey were stone, spiralling into the darkness at an angle so steep it made my \nlegs weaken slightly. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG041 – Too Deep \n9 \n \nThe steps led higher as well, but after a few metres disappeared into the solid \nstone of the ceiling. I made a note of their location and carried on, keen to \nexplore as much of the first level as possible before going any deeper. It was \nbecoming very apparent that these tunnels must have covered the entire area \nof Millbank, or even further, and there was every possibility they continued for \nmiles. I had seen little down there of note thus far, something I will admit gave \nme a pang of both disappointment and relief, and took a short break to drink \nsome water and compose myself. \nIt was shortly after this I found the next staircase. It was identical to the first in \nmaterial, in construction and look. It was the same in all but one detail: the \nlarge chalk arrow pointing downwards. I’m sure I don’t need to say that I had \nnot drawn it. My own arrows were jagged, workmanlike things. This was curled \nand neat, pointing the way with a flourish. \nThat was when I heard the noises again. They could have been footsteps, I \nsuppose, but if so they were soft, quiet. Was someone running around those \ntunnels barefoot? I froze in place and listened, but the noises did not return, \nand I gripped my knife. I am not a brave man. I believe I am starting to come to \nterms with that fact, but I am, in certain circumstances, a very stubborn one. \nAnd there was something inside me that made the decision that I would rather \ndie at the hands of some tunnel-dwelling beast than work above without \nknowing what it was. Maybe I’d be lucky, and find a crazed gun-wielding \nmadman, a convenient killer for Gertrude. \nI can almost hear my assistants chiding me for not turning tail and running \nthen and there, but it’s hard to fully explain the borderline mania that gripped \nme when I saw that arrow. Mocking and inviting all at one. I was not so foolish \nas to run down the stairs, but I descended them quicker that was safe. Down \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG041 – Too Deep \n10 \n \nand down and down they went, each rotation revealing more tunnels and \ndoors, but I saw no sign of reaching the bottom. I had gone down about four \nlevels when my torch caught what I thought was movement in the corridors \nbeyond. \nI left the stairs in pursuit, but was unable to find any sign of life. Or death, I \nsuppose. Only an empty wine bottle, the label all but rotted away, but the year \nwas still legible as 2003. The passages here were more pronounced in their \ndifference than the ones further up, some being so irregular and seamless as \nto almost seem organic, while others were almost unnervingly square and \nregular, with sharp angles and precisely laid bricks. \nIt was in one of these that it happened. I had continued to mark my route with \nchalk, and was scratching an arrow into a particularly flat wall, when I looked \nup to see the turning ahead of me was no longer there. Instead, there was \nsimply a dead end. I could find no sign that there had been any movement, nor \nhad I heard anything. I turned back, and immediately noticed that the wall \nopposite me was closer than it had been before. I took a step back in shock, \nand my feet hit the wall behind me. The passage was getting narrower, though \nI could not see any movement. I stood completely still and for several seconds \nthere was silence. Then, from somewhere in the darkness, I heard a single \nword, clear as day: “Leave.” \nIt was spoken simply, without intonation or threat. Just a command. \nSo I did. I began to shuffle back as quickly as possible the way I had come, \nkeeping my eyes open as long as I could, as every time I closed them the wall \nseemed to get even closer. By the time I reached the stairs back up, it had \nalmost pinned me. I fled back up the stairs, followe", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 5, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 4500}}
