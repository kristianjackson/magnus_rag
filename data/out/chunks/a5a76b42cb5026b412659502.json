I stood up and walked towards her. \nAs soon as she saw me, her posture changed and she became defensive, \nalthough the expression on her face never changed from that blankness. I \nstarted to introduce myself and ask how come she was taking over Craig’s bed, \nwhen she locked eyes with me. The weirdest sensation began to flow through \nme. I wanted to leave. It wasn’t like with a vampire where I would feel like I’d \nbeen spoken to. This was just a sudden awareness of my own desire. I’d been \nsober for three years at that point, but I felt like I desperately wanted to get \nhigh and I knew that the best place to get some was out in the night. Looking \n\nThe Magnus Archives –056 – Children of the Night \n12 \n \nback, I think it might have been my own mind rationalising the way I felt my \nwill being tugged out of the room, but it was still very powerful. If I hadn’t had \na lifetime’s experience identifying and fighting off the effect of the vampire’s \ngaze, I probably would have done it too. But I did, so I stood my ground. \nThere was a long pause as that woman gazed levelly at me. Then she broke \ninto a run, through the door and out. I followed. Didn’t matter to me whether \nshe was a vampire or not, there was something wrong and I wanted to find out \nwhat was going on. I chased her out into the road. It was cold and still and if \nanyone saw us, they didn’t make a sound. She ran strangely, more like a spasm \nthan smooth steps, and her arms shifted in weird ways as she moved. I’m not \nas spry as I once was, and my lungs are obviously shot, but I managed to keep \npace with her. I could feel it in my blood. It was a hunt and I always felt \nstronger on a hunt. \nFinally, I got close enough to grab her by the arm. My fingers locked around \nher elbow and then they sort of sunk inside. They didn’t go through the skin or \nanything, but it sort of shifted beneath my fingers, like when you squeeze an \nuncooked sausage, and I could feel movement from inside the arm itself. It \nwasn’t a vampire, but it definitely wasn’t human. With its other arm it took a \nwide, sweeping swing at me, but I was prepared and ducked below the flailing \npunch. I got out my knife to try and threaten the thing, maybe get it to answer \n\nThe Magnus Archives –056 – Children of the Night \n13 \n \nsome questions, but I misjudged the draw and ended up slashing it slightly \nacross its stomach. \nIt wasn’t a deep cut, or a long one, but apparently it was enough. Her whole \nbody began to shudder, as tiny shapes began to stream out of the wound. \nSpiders. Thousands and thousands of spiders. She opened her mouth at last, as \nif to scream, and more poured out. Tens of thousands of skittering legs and evil \nlittle eyes. I screamed and started to back up as the dark shapes pooled around \nher feet and spread out in a twitching circle. For a second I was worried they \nwere coming for me, but then they just scurried off into the shadows and \ncrevices of nearby buildings, until the street was empty of everything, except \nthis woman. She was still standing upright, but from the open mouth, I could \nsee that her body was completely hollow, save for a few cobwebs that I could \njust make out under the streetlights. I ran the hell away. \nAnd that’s the last creature I encountered. That’s my whole story. You’re \nwelcome to it. When I thought it was just vampires about, I might have given \nyou people a miss as a bunch of kooks. But if there’s other stuff around out \nthere, well maybe you know about it than me. And maybe you could use a bit \nmore information on vampires. It’s a shame I’m on the way out. I will miss the \nhunt.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 5, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 3663}}
