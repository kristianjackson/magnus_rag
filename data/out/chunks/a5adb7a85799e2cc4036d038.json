A light rain began to patter \ndown and I, not having had the foresight to pack an umbrella, ran to it and \nopened the door as quickly and as quietly as I could. Inside, it was warm and \ndry. Dust coated everything and I struggled more than once not to sneeze, \nsomething I was convinced would somehow alert my family to where I was. So, \nI crawled under one of the counters, and soon enough sleep had come for me. \nI awoke to the sound of rhythmic clattering, the noise of wood striking wood in \na complex, intricate pattern. I got up, more curious than fearful at that \nmoment, and took a few tentative steps towards it. The sound seemed to be \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 147 – Weaver \n \n15 \n \ncoming from one of the back rooms and, seeing how light seeped from below \nonly one of the doors, it seemed to me pretty obvious which room contained \nmy answers. So, I went inside, another action which, looking back after the \nfact, I find myself pleasingly baffled by. \nInside was a young woman I did not recognise, sat at what I would later learn \nwas an old-fashioned wooden loom. Her eyes and face were sunken, her hands \nand arms a blur as the machine pressed on. They arced over and through the \nloom, and I could see much of her inside forearms and upper legs were \ncovered in tiny holes: small red pinpricks, like insect bites. Looking back, of \ncourse, and remembering the crunch of used syringes beneath my feet, I \nrealise that addiction is one of the strongest vectors of control there is. \nThe woman looked up at me, disinterested, and I saw that the threads of the \nloom were laced into her skin, all through her track marks, and that dozens of \ntiny spiders ran up and down those weaving threads and scurried in and out of \nthe holes in her skin. Her eyes met mine, then travelled upwards, towards the \nceiling. I followed her gaze for barely five seconds before I fled home and \nabandoned my plans to run away entirely. I decided not to describe what I saw \nup there. I will only say that it is what engendered in me that terror of spiders \nwhich eventually led to my volunteering at Surrey University. I will simply say \nthat when a spider reaches a certain size, it is not entirely made up of spider \nanymore. \nSo, how much free will was involved in that story? What could I have chosen to \nchange? Would a different path have been possible? I felt no loss of control – \nno puppet strings guided me – and yet the Mother got exactly the result she no \ndoubt wanted, one that would lead to a fear of spiders so acute that I would \nlater have that horror focused and refined into a silk-spun apotheosis. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 147 – Weaver \n \n16 \n \nUnless, of course, none of it was intentional, none of it was planned. The \nMother is the fear of manipulation and lost control made manifest, so perhaps \nit is our fear that projects her influence on everything that happens, like the \nmind retrospectively assigning reason to our actions, so we fit whatever occurs \ninto the neatest pattern we can and declare her web both intricate and \ncomplete. Perhaps she is no more active than Terminus, simply sitting and \nrevelling in the inevitable cascade of paranoia, as those who hold her in special \nterror cocoon themselves in red string and theory. Or perhaps I am simply \ntelling you what you need to hear in order to behave exactly as the Mother \nwishes you to. Perhaps I have never even seen a beach. \nDon’t go to Hill Top Road again. \nARCHIVIST \nStatement ends. \n(Shaken) That was, uh ... I d-didn’t like that. I couldn’t ... \n(Clears throat) So, she is watching the Institute, interfering with things. Is that \nreassuring or really, really bad? I can’t say I’m … I can’t say I’m sad to have \nanother ally allegedly on our side, but I don’t like the idea of being important \nto The Web. That’s a really bad place to be. Annabelle’s right, though. I mean, I \ncan’t trust anything she says to not be another lie to further manipulate and \nmanoeuvre us, but deep down, I think she’s right. What I’ve been doing to \nthese people, it hasn’t been because I was puppeted or controlled or \npossessed. I wanted to do it. It felt good. But at least I know I can stop. I just ... \ndon’t know how. I don’t want to stop. \nGoddamn, this one really took it out of me. I need to go lie down.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 5, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 4340}}
