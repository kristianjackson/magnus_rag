Tape clicks on.] \nARCHIVIST \nHmm. What strikes me more than anything else here is the date. It’s only a \nyear or so before she died. I had assumed Gertrude had recorded to tape for a \nwhile and then stopped, but it seems she was recording them right up until the \nend. But if they did span decades of working at the Institute, why aren’t there \nmore? And what decided which statements she transferred? \nRegardless, whoever my mystery pen pal is, it seems they’re pushing me in a \nvery deliberate direction. It sounds like the Unknowing is a ritual, one \nconnected to the Stranger, this ‘I Do Not Know You’. What did Gertrude mean \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG087 – The Uncanny Valley \n12 \n \nabout skin? The page she was given by Mary, maybe? No, that doesn’t add up. \n(Sigh) God, this is confusing. \nFor the first time, though, I feel like I might have a lead. It’s tangential, not \ndirectly connected to the Stranger or the Unknowing, but… but I have a name \nnow. Jude Perry, and she was still living in London less than two years ago. It’s \nnot much, but it is a start. I don’t know if I have the resources to track her \ndown myself, but if Melanie’s willing to help, the Institute might have more \nluck. \n[The sound of strange music] \nARCHIVIST \nIf she is an active member of the Lightless Flame cult there’s every possibility \ntracking her down will be dangerous, but it’s also the… the only…? \nOh god… \n[Georgie opens the door] \nGEORGIE \nCan you hear that? Like a, an ice cream van or something? \nARCHIVIST \nCircus! \nGEORGIE \nYeah. Yeah, thought I was going mad. Christ, are you alright? \n[The music fades.] \nARCHIVIST \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG087 – The Uncanny Valley \n13 \n \nUmmm… \nGEORGIE \nWas it the tape? \nARCHIVIST \nWhat? No! No, it w– it w– it was – it was outside. \nGEORGIE \nNo, not, not the music, your face! \nARCHIVIST \nWhat? \nGEORGIE \nThat’s it. Whatever the hell this deal is, the tapes, documents, I don’t want \nthem in my house. \nARCHIVIST \nLook, look… No, no… Look, you, you don’t need to be scared. \nGEORGIE \nI’m not! You are! Look at you, you can barely stand! \nARCHIVIST \nBut I… But I need – \nGEORGIE \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG087 – The Uncanny Valley \n14 \n \nListen to me, John. I can’t stop you doing… whatever secret bullshit you want \nto do, and I’m… not going to throw you out on the street, but I’m not having it \nin by home. \nARCHIVIST \nNo… No, they won’t. I’ll make sure it doesn’t… I’ll keep it far away. \nGEORGIE \nNo, you need to stop. \nARCHIVIST \nI’m not sure I can. \n[Tape clicks off] \n[The Magnus Archives Theme - Outro] \nThe Magnus Archives is a podcast distributed by Rusty Quill and licensed under \na creative commons attribution, non-commercial share alike 4.0 international \nlicense.
