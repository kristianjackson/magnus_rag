Let me go. Just let me go. \nTHE SPIDER: Oh, Francis. It's such a shame that I couldn't do such a thing even \nif I wanted to. The man in the audience saw to that. (chuckles) \nI am no more free than you are, little puppet. Ah! If only you could see the \nstrings that bind me, that wind together as they pull me along my own path. \nPerhaps then you would not blame me so. But they are not the tripping \nthreads that we are here to watch, no. So sit, Francis. It's time. \n[A creaking twist of the hooks, and chair noise as Francis is seated] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 172 – Strung Out \n11 \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \n \nAnother tug of the hooks stretches the skin as Francis staggers towards the \ntable. The blood flows faster, so dark it is almost black. Their chest rises and \nfalls rapidly as they are lowered into the only seat, the dusty air of the theatre \nscratching their throat and drying their mouth. There is the taste of tin, \ngrowing stronger. \nThe hits are all arranged before them, spread across the table in a cornucopia \nof promised oblivions, releases, and delights. \n[A creaking twist of the hooks] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nFrancis feels the hooks tighten as they look upon the offering. \nThat deepest want bubbles up to the surface, but at its core there is still that \nmute fear, that anticipation of what surrender will bring. \nThere is no escape to be found here, no respite from the charade that is now \nthe sum of Francis’ existence. By now, Francis knows with utter clarity what \nfalling to the call will bring, the awful crawling fate that they will endure before \nthe next act eventually begins. \nThe syringe vibrates, almost imperceptibly, as the dark mass of legs and tiny, \nglittering eyes that sit within it shifts in anticipation. \nThe cork of the bottle moves ever so slightly proud of the top, pushed by the \nunfurling thing inside. The cigarette scuttles closer, inch by impatient inch. \nTheir longing is awful. And mutual. Pause. \nFRANCIS: I don't want it. Any of it. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 172 – Strung Out \n12 \nTHE SPIDER does not reply. \nStaring over the table, a memory now tugs at Francis, the faintest residue of an \nearlier time, when the things before them would have brought a genuine joy to \ntheir heart and even a temporary peace. A time when the hunger was sharp \nand real, not this dull, unending ache that does nothing but propel them \ntowards one grotesque act of consumption after another, but… for all their \nkeen awareness of what it might mean to do so, Francis cannot deny the want \nThe Spider has gifted them. \nThey resist. They sit oh-so-very still and keep their hands held tight to their \nchest. \nFRANCIS: No. Not this time. I won't. \n[The audience laughs] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nPause for laughter. \n[Laughter ends] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nFrancis looks up at The Spider, so close now the thick drippings of its jaws fall \nonto their shoulders in a sticky stream. It says nothing— \n[The sound of whipping rope that ends with stabbing flesh] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \n—but a hook leaps from the darkness backstage, fastening itself into the soft \nskin on the back of Francis’ free hand.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 3, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 3290}}
