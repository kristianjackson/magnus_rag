What did he want from her? His smile \nturned into a sneer. \n‘I should have known,’ he spat, ‘what a disappointment.’ \n[Carmen’s walking restarts] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nCarmen tried to walk faster, ignoring the middle-aged woman who looked her \nup and down, not bothering to hide the judgement in her gaze. All she had to \nsay was, ‘Oh.’ \nA little girl implored for Carmen to play with her, huge eyes pleading, but she \ndidn’t have time. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 188 – Centre of Attention \n \n18 \n‘You’re just like everyone said you were!’ the little girl screamed as Carmen \ntried to walk away. ‘No wonder Simone left you.’ \nShut up, shut up, shut up, there’s no way the child could have known that. Did \nsomeone see? Of course they did, of course they were always watching, \njudging, knowing all her business and there was nothing she could do to stop \nit. To keep them from being disappointed, to not hurt them. She just screwed \nup, and they all just watched her fall. \n[Transitions to a pen click followed by sporadic writing; in the \nbackground a fish tank burbles] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \n‘Sounds like you have the weight of the world on your shoulders,’ her therapist \nsaid, voice soft and mellifluous. The deep brown of her eyes met Carmen’s, \nand as always Carmen had to quiet the flutter of her heart, choke down and try \nher best to hide the seed of lust that had settled inside her long ago. But she \nwas certain she saw a flash of contempt pass across her therapist’s face. She \nknew, she had seen. \n‘It does feel like that,’ Carmen said. ‘There’s so much pressure, and I don’t \nknow why.’ \n‘I know why’, the therapist said. ‘It’s because everyone’s counting on you. \nEveryone’s watching.’ \n[Transitions to door slamming followed by furniture movements as \nCarmen rearranges the room; the muffled sound of London in the \nbackground] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 188 – Centre of Attention \n \n19 \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nCarmen was back in her room at last. She had no curtains, so pressed her \nmattress against the glass to keep out the light. To keep out the curiosity. Her \ndoor did not lock, so she pushed her unused desk against the flimsy MDF. To \nkeep out her flatmate. At last she was alone. Nobody could see her. She could \ndo what she liked and it would harm nobody. \nSo why didn’t she feel it? Why was there still that small, panicked buzzing in \nthe back of her mind that told her something could see her. That she was not \nalone. Carmen managed not to scream, but couldn’t stop herself kicking the \nwall in frustration. \n[A series of kicks against a wall, followed by plaster falling] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nThe rage passed in a moment and shame hit her like a truck. Someone had \nseen that, she was sure of it, and what must they think of her? \n[Large plaster falling sound, followed by an unpleasant, watery, \npulsing sound] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nOn the section of wall she had kicked, a big chunk of plaster crumbled to the \nfloor, revealing the brick behind. Carmen’s brow wrinkled, first in confusion, \nthen in horror. Set into those bricks behind the plaster was an eye. It was \nlarger than a human eye, and flatter, almost the size of her head, and it pulsed \ngently.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 5, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 3452}}
