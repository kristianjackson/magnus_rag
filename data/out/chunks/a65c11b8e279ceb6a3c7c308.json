Episode one hundred and four. \nSneak Preview. \n[Tape clicks off.] \n(Martin takes a deep breath) \nMARTIN \nStatement of Eduardo Acosta, regarding the night of October 9th— \n[There’s a crash of falling boxes] \n(Martin lets out a shout of surprise.) \nTIM \n(Unapologetically) Sorry. \n[The boxes or files are put away] \nMARTIN \n\nOh Christ, Tim! Oh, I... huh, oh, oh God, it’s alright, it’s just a shock. I didn’t \nrealise you were... \nTIM \nI’ve been moving boxes in here for a while. \nMARTIN \nYou... have you? \nTIM \nYeah. Everything alright? \nMARTIN \nYeah, I guess. I kind of... zone out a bit when I have to read a statement. \nTIM \nRight. Well, see ya. \nMARTIN \nOh no, Tim! Uh, Tim! \nTIM \nHmm? \nMARTIN \nUh, while I’ve got you, there’s a book I was after for, uh... well, it was, uh, uh, \nThe Marvellous Spiritualism and the Circus in the 19th Century? I asked up in \nthe library, but Tom said you had it checked out? \n\nTIM \nYeah. Why? \nMARTIN \nOh, you know, just looking into anything and everything that might pin down \nThe Unknowing. \nTIM \nThe what? \nMARTIN \n(Carefully) The Unknowing? \nTIM \nWell, am I supposed to know what that is or, or what? \nMARTIN \nYou don’t— Ah, ummm, heh heh, I just thought someone would have told you \nby now. \nTIM \nWell, they haven’t. What are you talking about? \nMARTIN \nI mean, I’m not… sure— \nTIM \n\nMartin! What is The Unknowing? And what does it have to do with the Circus? \nMARTIN \nIt’s... it’s uh, uh, a ritual. I don’t know the… it’s, it’s bad. Like, like really bad. \nLike, maybe ‘end of the world’ bad. And the Circus is doing it, the, the, the \nRussian ones, the, uh, Circus of the Other. \nTIM \n(Laughs) No, no, no, no, no. No, we haven’t— There hasn’t been a Circus \nstatement since Leanne Denikin’s last year, and that was a dead end! There’s... \nsomeone would have told me. \nMARTIN \nTim, you’ve been out of it for a while. \nTIM \nSomeone should have told me! \nMARTIN \nWhy? Tim, are you alright? \nTIM \nTurn it off. \nMARTIN \nWhat? \nTIM \n\n(Shouting) Turn it o— \n[Tape clicks off. Tape clicks on.] \nMARTIN \nPlease, Tim. \nTIM \nNo. \nMARTIN \nHe needs to hear it. \nTIM \nI don’t care. \nMARTIN \nHe can’t help if he doesn’t know. \nTIM \nI don’t want his help, Martin. \nMARTIN \nElias seems to think that he’s the best chance that we have to stop them. \nTIM \nAnd what? I’m supposed to just trust Elias now? \nMARTIN \n\nPlease. \nTIM \n(Exhales) Fine. Fine. I’ll tell him in person, when he gets back from... wherever \nit is that he’s vanished to. \nMARTIN \nChina. And if you try to tell him in person, you’ll just end up at each other’s \nthroats. You know you will. \nTIM \n(Bitter) Statement of Timothy Stoker, on the disappearance of... of my brother, \nDanny, four years ago. June 14th, 2017. \nMARTIN \nThank you. \nTIM \nStatement begins. \nTIM (STATEMENT) \nMy little brother Danny, he was always better than me. He was a couple of \nyears younger, but by the time he hit 21 he was already taller, fitter, better \nlooking. I mean, he didn’t have my winning sense of humour, but he didn’t \nneed it. Charisma, it wasn’t a problem for him. I think a lot of people in my \nsituation would have been… jealous, but not me. I was just proud of him.
