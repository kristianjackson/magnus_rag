No sun at all. \nThe sky had that thick layer of cloud that catches the heat and it choked me on \nin. Fields and fields of yellow grass that went on forever, with rusted pylons \nlooming over all of it. It was that appalling sort of summer you only get in the \nmiddle of England, with all the joy of the season stripped away, leaving endless \nfields of dry soil and emptiness. There was nothing to be done, nowhere to go; \njust watch and wait and think about the decay of it all. Walking among the \ndetritus of the countryside is the surest way I know to find yourself close to the \ntransience of humanity, seeing the little hints, the preview of what is to come \nfor all of us when the world no longer cares enough to keep us alive. \nHave you ever been driving along a motorway, passing through the middle of \nsome rural nothing place, when you spot, in the distance, on some tiny road \nyou have no idea how to reach, a row of three or four terraced suburban \nhouses? Just sitting there, no town or village for miles, just a weird, unattached \nlittle street – that’s where I live. It was where I grew up, where I left forever, \nand then where I returned to after my mother died and my business collapsed. \nThe two events were unrelated, but both happened close enough together \nthat I ended up moving back in with my dad. I told myself it was to take care of \nhim, but I’d been there five years before I knew it, and in a lot of ways the old \nman seemed more capable of dealing with the world than me. \nNot that he was supportive. He’d been a vet for most of his life and spent a lot \nof that time working with livestock. I think all those years hanging around \nfarmers must have rubbed off on him. He hated doctors, for instance, \nsomething I always pointed out was absurd given his own job. I’d say he was a \nvet, and he’d say, yeah, he was, and start talking about how many animals he’d \nput down in his career. I never had any interest in continuing the conversation", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 0, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 2797}}
