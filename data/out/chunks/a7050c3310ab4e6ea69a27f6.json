Emma had been given the statement of a \nwidow whose life and home and partner had been taken by a man who, as she \nput it, ‘burned on the inside’. And so Sarah and her secret tormentor went \nlooking for this being, and they found him standing in the smoking ruin of an \nold farmhouse. \nHe was bald, dressed in dreary office clothes. To a cursory examination, unfit \nand unremarkable, save for his peculiar surroundings. If they had paused and \nlooked closer, Emma might have seen the drizzling rain rising as steam from his \nskin. Sarah may have noticed the thin lines in his flesh from whence spilled a \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 167 – Curiosity \n15 \ndull orange glow. But they didn't. And as was her custom, Emma allowed her \nold knees to betray her, falling behind her companion. \nSarah Carpenter's last words were \"Hello? I'm from—\" \nAnd then it was over. He split open like a flower bud blooming, and inside \nthere was only the most terrifying heat. She had no time to run, and by the \ntime she thought to scream it was too late as the thing enveloped her, closing \ntight, until she was simply more ash, trapped forever inside that charred and \nhollow shell. Emma knew as she ran that she might have gone too far. \nWhen Gertrude returned with no Michael to a silent Archive and only Emma's \nstammered lies to fill it, she finally started to suspect the truth. She wondered \nbriefly if it was hypocrisy, to feel such anger at what Emma Harvey had done, \nwhen she now had blood aplenty on her hands, including Michael's. But it \ndidn't matter. The rage she felt was ice-cold. And so Gertrude went to the one \nperson she was certain she could trust on the matter. \nAgnes Montague and Gertrude Robinson only ever met once in their lives. \nEven if the Lightless Flame had allowed it, what would there have been to say? \nThe bond between them, real as it was, was no one's choice but the Web's, \nand neither of them were keen to play its game any further than they had to. \nTheir discussion was brief, and tinged with a melancholy, an awareness of \nmistakes, of their choices and duties and destinies. Neither of them smiled. But \nAgnes did confirm what Gertrude knew, and the details of Sarah's suffering \nonly sharpened that deep and wounded hatred. \nIt was a trivial matter to convince the man who now watched from the skull of \nElias Bouchard to allow it, so long as the deed did not take place within the \nArchives itself. But it didn't need to. An employee's home address is a simple \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 167 – Curiosity \n16 \nthing to acquire. When Emma Harvey awoke to the searing heat, she knew she \nwas already dead. As the fire took her, and left her flesh running off her bones \nlike oil, all she willed was not to give it the satisfaction of being afraid. I wonder \nif it would have upset Gertrude to learn that, even at the end, Emma had no \nidea it was her that had arranged it. Maybe not. For all her anger, there was no \nthirst for revenge in the Archivist, only an eagerness to expunge an infection \nthat had gone unnoticed for too long. \nAnd with that, Gertrude Robinson was without assistants. She never hired \nanother. She worked with those that seemed useful until they were no longer \nso — Leitner. Dekker. Keay. Even Salesa on occasion. But she never again \nallowed herself to trust. \n(Beat) \nI, I, I'm sorry; I-I didn't, um— \nMARTIN \nOh, no, it's, uh, it's okay. (cough) I just, I couldn't… not listen, or interrupt. Or— \nARCHIVIST \nI, I, I promise, I, I didn't know I was going to do that. \nMARTIN \nI, I understand. \n(Sigh) Well, let's... try to avoid that next time. (little laugh) \nARCHIVIST \nYes, quite.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 4, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 3734}}
