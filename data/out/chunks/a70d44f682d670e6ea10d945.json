It was almost 7 o’clock \nby this point and it was late June, so there was still a while before nightfall and \nI got more careful about my pursuit. There were less people here, so blending \ninto a crowd was no longer an option and I made sure to keep a bit more \ndistance as he walked down streets of terraced houses. \nWe had been walking for about twenty minutes when I began to realise that he \nwasn’t going into any of the houses. Instead, he made his way south until he \nreached the A13. He made his way over the motorway, now choked with \ncommuter traffic, and headed down into what looked like a warehouse or \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG049 – The Butcher’s Window \n4 \n \nindustrial estate on River Road. I was becoming less and less convinced that \nthis was a simple screwing around job, which made me uneasy, but it was still \na long way from scaring me off. Besides, I was curious, so I followed Hector \nover the A13 and down River Road. \nI was going very slowly now, as I was the only one walking down that road \nexcept for Hector and, if he turned around, well, idiot that he was, I don’t think \neven he could have failed to spot me. So, I stayed close to the buildings and \nducked behind them whenever I could. I’ll be the first to admit I’m not as fit as \nI was back when I was on the force, but I was still quick enough to keep up with \nHector’s slow, meandering pace. After another five minutes he reached a \nwarehouse with a ‘For Sale’ sign on it. There was nothing else notable or \ndistinctive about the place and the sign looked like it had been up for years. I \nspotted a small hole in the decaying concrete wall that divided it from the \nadjacent lot and made for it. Through the hole, I watched as Hector stopped \nand, for the first time, looked behind him. When he saw nobody and nodded \nlike he was congratulating himself on a job well done, I almost laughed so hard \nI gave myself away. \nHector checked his watch, clearly waiting for someone, and put down his \nbriefcase. It was only then I realised how odd it was that an IT tech would carry \nan old-fashioned leather briefcase to work. Still, I didn’t have much time to \nwonder about it before a red SUV pulled up and two white guys in tracksuits \ngot out and started heading towards Hector. I couldn’t make out what they \nwere saying, but I was snapping pictures anyway. I had a pretty good idea as to \nwhat was going on and I was not at all surprised when they handed Hector a \nbrown envelope, obviously full of money. In return, he opened the briefcase to \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG049 – The Butcher’s Window \n5 \n \nshow a tight, white brick, before snapping it closed again and handing it over. I \ntook plenty more pictures before slipping away unnoticed. \nDrugs complicated matters, but not necessarily in a bad way. Theoretically, \npictures of the crime could get Nicola out of her doomed marriage just as quick \nas any sleazy snapshots and, if I played my cards right, I could even make a \ngood bonus out of him myself in the form of some hush money. Blackmail’s an \nugly word, but it does pay the bills and, given how bad Hector was at spotting \nme, it was only a matter of time before he was behind bars, so I might as well \nget some use out of that sweet drug money before it was taken by the courts. I \nmean, he took the briefcase to work, for God’s sake. \nThe trick was going to be making sure that Hector wasn’t connected in a way \nthat would make this difficult. From what I could see, he was pretty low-rung \nand expendable enough that a bit of blackmail wouldn’t piss off any of the \nbigger fish trafficking what looked to be heroin. Still, drug dealers and their \nbosses can be unpredictable, so I decided to keep watching the poor slob for a \nwhile to make sure I wasn’t going to be stepping on the wrong toes. \nSo, for the next week I watched Hector all day, every day, and I can confidently \nsay that he was the worst drug mule I’ve ever come across. I knew some real \nscrew-ups back in my police days, but nothing that even came close to Hector \nLerado. I genuinely had no idea how he ended up working for these guys, who I \neventually pegged as Ukrainian mafia. I suppose he did look like the last person \nyou’d suspect of running drugs, but that was the only thing he had going for \nhim. In addition to being unbelievably oblivious, he was also sloppy and \nforgetful. I once watched him leave the suitcase, drugs and al", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 2, "chunk_count": 10, "chars": 4500}}
