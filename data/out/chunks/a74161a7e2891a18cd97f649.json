(softening) I don't, I don't know; I feel like I saw \nsomething in the trees. \nARCHIVIST \nYou did. \nMARTIN \n(Sarcastic) Oh! Fantastic. You're very reassuring, you know that? \nIs it that… pack thing you were talking about? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 176 – Blood Ties \n15 \nARCHIVIST \nNo, they'd have, they'd have no interest in us. We're not one of them. \nMARTIN \nLook, John, if-if you know what it is, then why don't you just tell me, so— \nARCHIVIST \nHold up. Shh. \nMARTIN \nWh-no! No, John, you just did a statement, I don't care if you want another \none— \nARCHIVIST \n(Interrupting) Martin. \nMARTIN \n—we've gotta move… \n(Beat) \n[There is some quiet movement coming closer towards them] \nARCHIVIST \nRight. Martin, do you trust me? \nMARTIN \nWhat? Ah, Christ, this can't be good. Y-yes? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 176 – Blood Ties \n16 \nARCHIVIST \nThen it's very — listen — look at me. The next couple of minutes are going to \nbe quite unpleasant for one of us, and I'm sorry. \n(Martin makes bewildered stuttering noises) \nMARTIN \nSorry, what? \nARCHIVIST \nYou need to remain very calm, and don't make any sudden movements. \nMARTIN \nOh, okay, now I'm worried; what d'you— \n[The bushes rustle from a rush of movement; there is impact and \nknife clink sounds, and an attacker growls] \nMARTIN \n(Shakily) Huh! \nTREVOR HERBERT \n(Desperation) Don't move! Don't you fucking move! \n(Martin gasps out a choked breath) \nAnd don't you say a word, or I'll cut him open! I know what that voice of yours \ncan do, so shut it! \nARCHIVIST \n(Politely, in control) Mm-hmm. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 176 – Blood Ties \n17 \n(Trevor slowly calms his ragged breathing over several beats) \nTREVOR \nOkay. You can talk. But slow-like. You try and do any of that — word magic — \nand he's dead. \n(Martin breaths shakily) \nARCHIVIST \n(Slowly) Understood. \nHello, Trevor. \nMARTIN \n(False calm) John? What's going on? \nARCHIVIST \nIt's okay. Trust me. \nMARTIN \n(High) Okay. \nTREVOR \nIt's not okay. Stop fucking smiling! \n[Trevor grips Martin tighter, the knife closer] \n(Martin lets out a pained sound) \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 176 – Blood Ties \n18 \nMARTIN \n(Shaky will false-calm) John? I know you keep saying we're safe, and I am \nfeeling very calm, but just so I know, can he… can he kill me? \nARCHIVIST \nHe could, yes. \nMARTIN \nRight. \nARCHIVIST \nIf he were still a hunter. \nTREVOR \n(Hissing) Shut it. \n'Course I'm still a hunter! \n[Trevor jostles Martin further] \n(Martin lets out a pained sound) \n(Trevor's breathing is heavy, and he grunts) \nMARTIN \nMm-hmm… gotta go with Trevor on that one, John! \nARCHIVIST \n(Dark) No. Right now he's prey. \n[A trill from a bird of prey] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 176 – Blood Ties \n19 \nARCHIVIST (CONT'D) \nHow long have you been running now, Trevor? \n(Trevor's breathing becomes more fearful) \nTREVOR \nDon't know. Too long. \nARCHIVIST \nAnd Julia? \n(Beat) \nTREVOR \nDead. \nARCHIVIST \nI'm sorry. \nTREVOR \n(Upset) Shut it! \nShoulda been me. I'm old. Slow. (breathing harder) It's not fair, outliving her. \nBut that dog of yours, that rabid bitch— she knew— Killed her first, so she \ncould see me limp away. \nIt's a game to her. \nARCHIVIST \nIf you're looking for my pity, I'm afraid you’re too late. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 176 – Blood Ties \n20 \nMARTIN \nJohn…? \nTREVOR \n(Aggressive) What I want, is to make you feel the same loss! \nMARTIN \n(Wavering) John! \nARCHIVIST \nIt's okay, Martin. \n(Trevor’s breathing calms) \nMaybe I spoke too soon. Perhaps I do have some pity for you. After all, I know \nyou, Trevor, you've had a tough life. Hardship from beginning to, huh, this \nstrange and twisted end. \nTREVOR \nNever complained. \nARCHIVIST \nNo. You haven't, have you? And maybe that's the greatest tragedy of all this. \nI'm sorry, Trevor. \n(Trevor's breathing goes from calmed to fast and heavy) \nTREVOR \n(Aggitated) For what?", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 4, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 4312}}
