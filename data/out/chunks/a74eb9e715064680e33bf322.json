In fact! I’ll join you. \nARCHIVIST \n(Surprised) Oh! O-kay, um, a-al, alright then? \n[Sounds of continued pouring behind all this] \nSASHA \nMartin? \nMARTIN \nOh! Uh, (slight laugh) I mean- I don’t- normally- drink wine, you know- t-\ntannins are a proven headache trigger, and so- \nSASHA \nMartin. \nMARTIN \nW-, uh- (more stuttering) - yeah, sure, maybe, just uh, a drop. Heh. \n[Pouring ends] \nARCHIVIST \n(Informatively) You know that there’s a lot of tannin in tea as well? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 161 – Dwelling \n15 \nMARTIN \nWhat? \nARCHIVIST \nHang on, have you been recording this? \nTIM \nOh! Yeah! I- just thought it might be nice, you know, something to look back on \nwhen we’re all old and sick of each other. \nSASHA \nYou probably should have told us, Tim. \nTIM \n(Laughing) What, are you afraid we’re going to get sued over the Happy \nBirthday song? \nMARTIN \nOh, oh, well I am now! \n(Tim sighs) \nSASHA \nIt’s just a bit of a privacy thing. \nARCHIVIST \n(Crosstalk) (Under his breath) Oh, hypocrite. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 161 – Dwelling \n16 \nTIM \n(Crosstalk) Alright, alright, fine, look. I’m turning it off. Any last words for your \nfuture selves? \nARCHIVIST \nYes. Fire Tim! \n(Tim laughs) \n[Tape click] \n[In the background is the sound of strange and distant howls from \nunknown creatures, and the sound of muffled wind. Closer, wood \ncreaks regularly, as of a building settling and moving] \n(The Archivist exhales and breathes somewhat shakily) \n[There are three soft knocks at the door, and footsteps] \nMARTIN \n(Gentle) Hey. \nARCHIVIST \n(Quiet but rough) Hi. \n[Footsteps as Martin moves into the room] \nMARTIN \nYou, uh, listening to the tapes again? \n[Pause with clothing rustles] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 161 – Dwelling \n17 \nMARTIN (CONT’D) \nHow many times is that, now? \nARCHIVIST \nThey were sent to me, Martin. There’s got to be some reason— \nMARTIN \n(Sigh) Gloating, John. Elias won, and there were some tapes he’d kept for \nhimself, and he wanted to gloat. So he sent them. I, I don’t see— \nARCHIVIST \nHe’s not. Elias. \nMARTIN \nJonah, then. I don’t know; I find it hard to think of him as— I don’t really like to \nthink of him. \n(beat) \nYou should get some sleep. \nARCHIVIST \nI- (sigh) Can’t. I, I can’t. I, I don’t think I do anymore. Sleep. (shaky) How long’s \nit been, now? \nMARTIN \nI don’t know. It’s not like there are days to count anymore, (sigh) all the clocks \nare stopped, and... \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 161 – Dwelling \n18 \nARCHIVIST \nWell, I haven’t yet. I get- tired, but it doesn’t feel the same. \nProbably for the best. Sleep doesn’t look... pleasant. \nMARTIN \n...No, it’s…. It’s. Not. \nARCHIVIST \nI couldn’t wake you. \nMARTIN \nI’m sorry. \nARCHIVIST \nIt’s not- (struggling) you’re not the one who ended the world. \n(Archivist breath shows he’s close to tears) \nMARTIN \n(Forced brightness) Well, just as well I don’t remember my dream. \nARCHIVIST \nI do. \nMARTIN \nWhat? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 161 – Dwelling \n19 \nARCHIVIST \nThey— I see most of the suffering around here. When it’s quiet, it just— It’s \nlike.. I can.. see it, like I’m watching all of it. \nMARTIN \nYou haven’t been opening the curtains. \nARCHIVIST \nNo, I don’t need to. It can see us here, and.. and I can see out as well. \nMARTIN \nO-kay, we’ll just file that under— ominous for now. \n(Beat) \nWe seem safe enough in here, at least. \nARCHIVIST \nI suppose so. \nMARTIN \nBit of a hideaway? \nARCHIVIST \nOr a prison. \nMARTIN \n...Yes. Still, better than outside. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 161 – Dwelling \n20 \n[Pause, as the sound of strange and distant howls and the building \nwood creaks continue] \nMARTIN (CONT’D) \nIt sounds bad. \n(The Archivist laughs a strange, humorless laugh) \nARCHIVIST \nIt is. \n(Beat) \nMARTIN \nAre we still safe? \nARCHIVIST \nY-Yes. It- It doesn’t want to harm me. \nMARTIN \nAnd me? \nARCHIVIST \nI won’t let it. \nMARTIN \nUm, thanks. \n(Beat) \n[Breaths and clothing rustle]", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 2, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 4122}}
