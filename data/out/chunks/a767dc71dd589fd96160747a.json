It mean, it seems pretty calm apart from... Wait. Wait, wait. No, no, no, \nno, no, no. It’s not more children, is it? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 180 – Moving On \n7 \nARCHIVIST \nNo, no, no, the necropolis is fine. Uh, I mean, well, obviously it’s, it’s bad, i-i-it’s \nhorrible... \nMARTIN \nS-So why the hurry? Where are we going? \nARCHIVIST \nAh… well… \nMARTIN \nCome on, don’t play coy. \nARCHIVIST \nI’m not being coy, it’s just, well… \nMARTIN \nWait. Wait… are you excited? \nARCHIVIST \n(Enthused) A bit. Maybe. \nMARTIN \n(Suspicious) Why? What’s next? \nARCHIVIST \n(Excited) I don’t know. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 180 – Moving On \n8 \nMARTIN \nIn what way? \nARCHIVIST \nAll the ways. I don’t know what’s next. \nMARTIN \nWhat? But, like, you, you can see “literally everything” so— \nARCHIVIST \nI-I can! But it’s a blind spot! No idea why. I-I didn’t realise until we got closer, \nand I was looking at our route, but… I can’t see the area after the necropolis. \nNone of it. It’s like the inside of the Panopticon, or, or wherever Georgie and \nMelanie are hiding. \nMARTIN \nOr Annabelle. \nARCHIVIST \n...Or Annabelle. \nMARTIN \nYou think the others might be there? \nARCHIVIST \n(Delighted) I have no idea. It’s a mystery! \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 180 – Moving On \n9 \nMARTIN \nJust so you know, this… this is an adorable look on you. \nARCHIVIST \n(Impatient) Yes, yes, yes, yes... \nMARTIN \n(Humouring) Alright then. Lead on Scooby, let’s go solve a mystery, ooooh... \nARCHIVIST \nAh… actually, no, hold on. \nMARTIN \n(Sighing) Of course. \nARCHIVIST \nSorry to be a burden. \nMARTIN \nFine, fine. Just… stay in this… avenue while you do it. I don’t want to lose sight \nof you. \nARCHIVIST \nOf course. \nMARTIN \nNot when there’s a mystery on the loose, oooh... \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 180 – Moving On \n10 \nARCHIVIST \nThank you. \n[Footsteps as Martin walks off] \n[Hissing static starts] \n[Sounds of trees creaking and rustling in a breeze with far birds] \n[Every so often, a clink of metal can be heard] \nARCHIVIST \nAway and around and away they stretch. Row upon row of waiting granite and \nwatching marble. \n[Hissing static ends] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nThe names are carved with steady-handed reverence, and the dates do not \nmake sense, but… bite your tongue. Read the epitaphs quietly to yourself in a \nrespectful, solemn whisper: ‘loving son’, ‘noted philanthropist’, ‘honoured \nhero’, and do not question them out loud. For these graves, they are not silent \n– they are listening. \n[Footsteps on paving stone, then stop] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nStop a moment, and see the stone angels perched above you, staring down \nfrom the harsh corners of each mausoleum roof, looking out over the avenues \nof darkened, not-quite-moonlit, paving slabs, which buckle ever so slightly \nevery step, as though the soil beneath is damp and yielding. Hungry. The \nangels have no expressions, their faces worn and pockmarked from the cold \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 180 – Moving On \n11 \nand vicious rain that finds the time to fall with disinterested cruelty at times \nupon their post. But the swords that each one carries do not wear, nor rust, \nnor blunt. They keep their eager vigil, desperate for a comment, a word, a \nbreath out of place against which they might strike. Upon each blade the \nwords stand out in stark and silvered letters: NIHIL NISI BONUM. \n[Faint hissing static under the Latin] \n[Footsteps restart, hurry along] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nWalk faster now, pick up the pace, for not all the tombs are silent, not all the \ngraves are at peace. Is that a voice, calling sweetly from beyond the iron gate, \ntelling you that it has something to show you, secrets that it wishes to share? \n[Footsteps stop; something else moves nearby, followed by faint \nsounds of sone scraping; then footsteps resume] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nJust knock and ask to enter. Or try your best not to hear, to think nothing but \ngood and admirable thoughts of those who wait in monuments to their own \nvirtue. There now, a face, pale and stained with age and death and sin— \n[Fervent rattle of chains] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \n—no, not sin, never sin. Misjudgement. Indiscretion. Misunderstanding. \n[Stone scrapes and undead vocalisations]", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 1, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 4302}}
