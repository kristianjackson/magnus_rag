So I put my gun down to do so. \nObviously he didn’t have one, but I couldn’t understand what was happening. \nI’d been with him not three minutes before and he had been alive and \nunharmed. It didn’t make sense. \nThen I heard that whistling. That infernal whistling from the treeline. I turned \nand there was the hiker. His right hand was coated in Arden’s blood, and he \ngrinned at me. Then he began to sprint. His speed was incredible, and he loped \nfrom side to side with a sort of zigzag motion. I ran. I know I should have \npicked up my gun, but you can’t understand just how frightening it is to have \nsomething like that, a true predator, running at you full pelt. Your death \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG031 – First Hunt \n7 \n \ncharging towards you like freight train. You can’t understand what it is to be \nprey. So I ran. \nI turned tail, leaving my pack and my gun behind, and sprinted into the woods. \nI didn’t look back, I couldn’t. It took all my concentration to keep my footing, to \nnot trip. I could hear him occasionally behind me, as he charged through a \nbush or scratched against a tree. I think he did it deliberately, you know. To let \nme know he was still there. There’s no way I could have won that footrace, but \nI think he must have been toying with me. After a while I could no longer hear \nhim directly behind me, so I slowed to catch my breath. I’m in good shape, as I \nsay, but I’m not a young man and I was dizzy with the exhaustion. \nI sat there, so intent on listening out for any sign of danger, of this man, that I \nbarely even noticed night fall. There were no clouds that night, and I was glad, \nsince I had left my torch along with my pack. If I was to run at all during the \nnight, I would need the moonlight to see by. Of course, any experienced hiker \nwould tell you never to travel the woods at night, and certainly not to run \nthrough them, but I hardly had any choice if it came to it. And of course it did. \nThe night was barely half an hour old when I heard it again, that… whistling, \nthen the words floating through the trees, but with an low, bass tone to them. \n“A-hunting we shall go, A-hunting we shall go”. \nAnd once again I ran. By all rights I should have broken my neck, charging off \ninto the darkness like that. I should have tripped on a root or put my foot in a \nrabbit hole. I should have at least twisted my ankle. Somehow this didn’t \nhappen, though; I ran and ran and, well, I just kept running. It didn’t seem to \ndo me any good, of course. I was still far slower in the dark than I had been \nduring the day, and it was obvious my pursuer could easily outpace me if he \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG031 – First Hunt \n8 \n \nwanted to. So many times I’d hear that song coming from in front of me, and \nturned sharply to avoid it, until I was utterly lost. \ninally, I broke through the treeline. I thought at first I’d found another clearing, \nbut looking down, I saw I was next to Arden’s mutilated body. The wretched \nthing had just sent me in a circle. For fun. For the chase. I was tired, scared, \ncovered in scratches and bruises over my entire body, and for nothing. I was \nstill going to die. \nI turned to face my fate, and for the first time that night got a good look at my \nhunter. The moonlight shone on him in full and what I saw was not human. It’s \nhard to describe exactly, but everything about him was sharper. His fingers, his \nteeth, his face, his eyes. His skin. \nAs I looked at him, the strangest thing popped into my head. Have you ever \nread The Duchess of Malfi? I had to study it for my O-Levels, many years ago. \nDreadful play, as I remember, the worst sort of old revenge tragedy, all incest \nand murder and madness. But there’s a line that stays with me, a doctor \ndiagnosing the Duchess’ brother with lycanthropy. As I recall it goes, “Once \nmet the duke, ‘bout midnight in a lane behind St. Mark’s church, with the leg \nof a man upon his shoulder. Said he was a wolf. Only difference was, a wolf’s \nskin is hairy on the outside, his on the inside”. Looking at this thing that \nwanted to kill me, it’s the only way it’s the only description that feels right. \nHe didn’t charge this time, but slowly stalked towards me. I was… acutely \naware of the loaded guns by my feet, but I’d seen how fast it could move and I \ndidn’t rate my chances. It got close. Close enough that I could smell the foetid \nbreath. Close enough that I could see the most disturbing thing illuminated by \nthe moonlight: the slic", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 3, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 4499}}
