Uh, I, I need to, um… \nMARTIN \nNow? Seriously? We're almost out of here. \n(The Archivist sighs) \nARCHIVIST \n(Wry) I'm sorry. Not really up to me. \nMARTIN \nFine. \n(Martin sighs) \nARCHIVIST \n(Flippant) If you're bored, you could always take in a show. \nMARTIN \nThat's, that's not funny, John. \nARCHIVIST \nIf you say so. \nMARTIN \nJust, just give me a shout when you're done, alright? \n[Martin walks away] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 172 – Strung Out \n3 \nARCHIVIST \nGood.

The audience watches, drooling, expectant. A table stands in the middle \nwith a single chair. On that table can be seen a bottle, cigarettes, paraphernalia \nof all shapes, sizes, and consumptions. \n[Rope creaks] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nFrom the space above the stage hang the hooks. They shift, gently, without the \nbreeze, as eager and hungry as the patrons in the seats. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 172 – Strung Out \n4 \n[Footsteps on a theatre stage] \n \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nEnter Francis, stage left. They walk slowly, unsteadily. Every limb is shaking. \nFRANCIS, softly: Please. Please god, not again. I don't want it to happen again. \n[Laughter from the audience] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nPause for laughter. \n[Laughter ends] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nTHE SPIDER, offstage: Then walk away, Francis, just turn and leave. All that is \nrequired is a little bit of willpower. \n[More rope creaks] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nYou have a little bit of willpower, don't you? \nFrancis begins to cry. They turn back towards the wings, keen to make their \nexit, but where they stood a moment before, there is now a dangling hook. \n[The sound of whipping rope that ends with stabbing flesh] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nIt lunges at Francis, digging into their leg, pushing through the flesh of their \nthigh.
