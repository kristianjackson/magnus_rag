And as we unveiled our new and \nabsent son, the sacrifices who remained screamed and fell in holy agonies, and \nthe world of endless night we had been promised began to pour in, shining out \nand all around us. It touched and caressed our souls with the soothing fears of \nnight, and I heard Maxwell weeping with joy at what we had done. \nAnd then ... it stopped. It just stopped. All at once, that loving embrace was \nstripped from us, and it began to retreat, to recede back into the place that it \nhad come from. We were so close. We were so close. I heard Maxwell cry out, \nscrambling desperately to the Dark Sun, stopping just short of touching it, but \nit was too late. Whatever it was that you and your Archivist did, it clearly \nworked. We left, half of us dead and the other half destroyed by coming so \nclose to the true essence and being denied. In my most wretched hours, I \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 143 – Heart of Darkness \n \n11 \n \nwonder, “Perhaps it was us? Perhaps we simply lacked faith: we weren’t \nworthy; the world wasn’t worthy.” But no, we were ready. We had earned our \ndark rapture, and we were robbed. \nI don’t know how long we waited after that. It was weeks before anyone \nspoke. And then, when they did, the arguments began, the recriminations, the \ndesperate resolutions to try again, to find what went wrong. But I could see in \nhis eyes that Maxwell was so very tired, and all the words fell to nothing. \nInstead we began the search for his successor, a new host for his continuation. \nHe would regain his strength and we would plan our next move. It was difficult, \nthough; the approaching culmination had meant Maxwell had not prepared \nanother host, and the search for another vessel was long and involved. Finally, \nabout 18 months ago, we found one – a child whose father had, by \ncoincidence, been directly marked by the dark. It was a desperate plan, but we \nwere desperate, a shadow of what we had been. Maxwell left me here to \nguard the black sun, and everyone else left to help in his rebirth. \nBut it didn’t work, did it? I can only assume we were too weak to hide from you \nand you struck when Maxwell was vulnerable. For the first six months, I let \nmyself hope that my suspicions were unfounded, that the silence I felt was \nsimply him lying low, recovering before returning to his abandoned disciple. \nBut no. Soon enough, I could no longer fool myself. He had been slain and I \nwas alone, and here I have remained. Perhaps I have told myself that I am \npreparing, gathering my own strength and making my plans to continue the \nchurch in his name, but I think in my heart I have been waiting for this \nmoment, for the final axe to fall and finish the last remnant of our holy \ncrusade. And here, at last, you are. \n \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 143 – Heart of Darkness \n \n12 \n \nMANUELA \nThere. Now you can kill me like the others. \nBASIRA \nShe telling the truth? \nARCHIVIST \nYeah, I mean, unless she can lie to me somehow. You said it wasn’t the eclipse. \nBASIRA \nIt’s not the time. \nARCHIVIST \nWell, she believes it, at least. This doesn’t make any sense. \nMANUELA \nWell, where is she? Afraid to face what she’s done? \nBASIRA \nJust shut up. \nMANUELA \nHm, coward. So, how did she do it? It’s been three years, waiting, guarding this \nplace without hope. At least do me the courtesy of telling me how she \ncollapsed our moment of triumph. \nARCHIVIST \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 143 – Heart of Darkness \n \n13 \n \nYou really don’t know, do you? \nMANUELA \nKnow what? \nARCHIVIST \nGertrude’s dead. She died right around the time of your ritual. \nMANUELA \nHa, so stopping us took everything she had. \nBASIRA \nYou wish. She was murdered. Unrelated, as far as we can tell. \nMANUELA \nThat’s ... I … Then why are you here? Maxwell is dead. The ritual failed. What’s \nleft? \nARCHIVIST \nA good question. \nBasira? \nBASIRA \nYou said the Dark Sun was still here. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 143 – Heart of Darkness \n \n14 \n \nMANUELA \n(Snorts) Fine. If you’re so keen to take everything, undo the work of centuries, \nit’s just through that door. \n[Footsteps] \nBASIRA \nJohn? \nARCHIVIST \n(Compelling) How dangerous is it? \nMANUELA \nOnly myself, Maxwell and Natalie could even look upon it. It will annihilate you \nboth in an instant. \nBASIRA \nAsk her how we can destroy it. \nARCHIVIST \nI know how. I just need to see it. \nBASIRA \nSee, as in … \nARCHIVIST \nAs in, actually see it.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 3, "chunk_count": 5, "chars": 4427}}
