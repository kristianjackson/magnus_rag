I could feel a despairing \nmoan escape my chest before I could do anything to stop it. At this, there was \nmovement behind me and the man I had seen earlier stepped into view. He \nwas shirtless, and the glow of the candles seemed to illuminate in stark \nshadow how painfully thin he seemed. He was chewing thoughtfully on \nsomething, though I couldn’t see what, and held a long, sharp butcher’s knife \nin his hand. \nI tried to say something, but the words caught in my throat. What the hell are \nyou supposed to say in that sort of situation? After a minute or two, he \nswallowed whatever he had been eating in a swift gulping motion, like an owl \n\nconsuming a mouse. He smiled a smile of both satisfaction and expectation, \nand asked me if I was awake. He spoke with a crisp RP accent, which surprised \nme. You know what’s messed up? Here was this guy clearly about to kill me \nand carve me up for meat, and I still somehow felt bad about making the \nassumption that he couldn’t speak English, like I didn’t want my last thoughts \non Earth to be low-key racist. \nI tried to ask him who he was, but again my breath caught in my throat. He \nseemed to notice, though, and walked over to me slowly. He crouched down \non his haunches, lowering his face to me, and asked me to speak up. I finally \nmanaged to croak out a question, asking who he was, but he just laughed that \nsoft, disorientating laughter. In a single, smooth motion the knife lashed out, \ncutting through my bound hands and neatly severing three of my fingers in a \nsudden burst of white-hot pain. I screamed, both from the injury and the \nhopes that someone might hear, but my captor didn’t seem to notice or care. \nInstead he picked up my fingers one by one and tossed them off-handedly \nonto the pile behind him. \nWalking over to the pile of old bibles he picked one up and started to \ndistractedly leaf through it. He started talking again, asking if I knew that one \nof the reasons the Romans persecuted early Christians was because they \nbelieved them to be cannibals. Most people, he told me, assumed it was due \nto the Romans being confused over the nature of the “body and blood of \nChrist” that the early Christians were consuming, but that Octavius of Minucius \nFelix listed all sorts of grotesque accusations, including initiation rites that \ninvolved the murdering of an infant and drinking its blood. He looked over to \nsee if I was listening, which I was, though mostly in the hopes he wouldn’t cut \nme again. I asked him if he \n\nwas a Christian, and a look of irritation crossed his face. He shook his head and \nthrew the bible back onto the pile, telling me that I wasn’t listening, that I \ndidn’t understand, that the accusations were obviously false, like any iteration \nof the old blood libel, so of course he wasn’t a Christian, as they both honour \nand disregard the body, and then something about their view of the soul. \nI was getting really lost at this point; he was rambling on about meat and souls \nand blood and I just lay there, waiting for him to kill me. I wanted to scream \nagain, try to attract someone’s attention from outside, but I didn’t know what \nthis thin, jagged man would do. He stopped his speech mid-sentence, as \nthough he could tell I was no longer listening, and looked into my eyes with a \ngrin. He started to walk towards me, the knife held loosely at his waist, a \nwetness on his lips, and in that moment I was a hundred percent sure I was \ngoing to die. \nAll at once a huge, dark shape barrelled into my captor, knocking him to the \nfloor and sending the knife clattering to the ground. It was Leroy. He must have \ngotten worried waiting and come to find me. \nHe stood over the thin, winded form and kicked it in the ribs, hard enough that \nI could hear something snap. Then he picked up the knife, walked over to me \nand cut through the cable ties keeping me in place. He started to pull me to my \nfeet before I could protest about my ankle, but surprisingly, it seemed to bear \nmy weight without any problems. I looked down and, although I could plainly \nsee dried blood all around it, my ankle was... fine. I stared in disbelief, then \nlooked at my right hand, which still seemed to have all five fingers. It didn’t \nmake any sense. I could still see the ones he had cut-off on the pile. One of \nthem bore my heavy silver ring, while the same finger on my hand did not.
