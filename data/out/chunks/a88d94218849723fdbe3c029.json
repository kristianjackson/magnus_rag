The Magnus Archives. Episode one hundred and ninety-\neight: \"Precipice.\" \n[Theme finishes] \n[Tape clicks on] \n[Footsteps on a gritty track, accompanied by swirling winds] \n(Martin sighs) \n(Beat) \nMARTIN \nSo... are we going to talk about it or...? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 198 – Precipice \n2 \nARCHIVIST \nWhen we get back to London. I don’t— I think we all need some time to think. \nMARTIN \n...Sure. \n[Footsteps continue for a few beats, with the occasional sigh] \nMARTIN (CONT’D) \nI-I mean it’s a pretty long walk. We could talk about something else. \nBASIRA \nLike why you wandered off with Annabelle Cane? \nARCHIVIST \nBasira... \nBASIRA \nIt’s important. \nARCHIVIST \nHe can tell us when he’s ready. \nMARTIN \nUh, it’s fine. It’s not exactly a big surprise or anything. \nBack in London, after we… uh… \nARCHIVIST \nHad a blazing row? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 198 – Precipice \n3 \nMARTIN \nI, uh… Yeah, that. \nBASIRA \nWhat? \nARCHIVIST \nAbout what we should do with Jonah. With the Panopticon. \nBASIRA \nHow, about whether you should, uh...? \nARCHIVIST \nYes. \nMARTIN \nWell anyway, after that I was coming out to look for you. But the tunnels are \njust all over the place and you must have used a different way up or \nsomething, and well... she was there. \nARCHIVIST \nWaiting? \nMARTIN \nI guess? It was so quiet. And it looked like London did before. So then I figured \nthat she must have had the camera, which meant Salesa was probably dead, \nand so… well… \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 198 – Precipice \n4 \nBASIRA \nSo…? \nMARTIN \nSo I figured she had come to kill you, John. \nARCHIVIST \nMe? \nW-What about you? \nMARTIN \nWhat about me? I didn't really think I was important enough to kill. \n(Surprised exhale from the Archivist) \nBASIRA \nWow, Martin that’s— \nMARTIN \nShocker, I have self-esteem issues, not the point. Anyway, she said she knew \nwhat you were planning to do, what would happen to you in there and... and \nthen she said she knew another way, one where you’d be okay, but she \ncouldn’t tell me, she had to show me. \nBASIRA \nAnd you took her at her word? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 198 – Precipice \n5 \nMARTIN \nObviously not, but... if she was telling the truth it seemed worth the gamble. \nARCHIVIST \nWhy didn’t you come and get me? \nMARTIN \nBecause she said if I did she’d leave without me. And then… well… we’d have \nhad to stick with crappy Plan A, and you’d… you’d end up gone. \n[The stop walking] \nMARTIN (CONT’D) \nOkay, look, I-I admit it wasn’t great judgement, okay? But I didn't see another \nchoice. I figured you were safe enough with the girls, and well… \nARCHIVIST \nYou were angry. \nMARTIN \nYeah. \nBASIRA \nRight. \nMARTIN \nAnd… if I could give you another way out, it had to be worth the danger. \nEven if it was kinda— \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 198 – Precipice \n6 \nBASIRA \nReckless? \nMARTIN \n—a long shot. \nBASIRA \nHmm. \nMARTIN \nPlus… I knew you’d follow me, and save me (nervous chuckles) if things got \nbad. \n(Archivist sighs) \nLook, I’m, I’m sorry I worried you. \nARCHIVIST \nIt’s okay. \nMARTIN \nBut it does look like I was right. \nBASIRA \nIf she was actually on the level. \nMARTIN \nWell… yeah. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 198 – Precipice \n7 \nBASIRA \nAnd if she was, she went about it in a really weird— \nARCHIVIST \nManipulative way. \nBASIRA \nYeah. Big surprise. But she did kinda hold up her end. \nARCHIVIST \nHuh. \nMARTIN \nI could’ve done without all the webbing, though. Still sticky. Urgh. \n[Martin rubs some webbing remnants off him] \nARCHIVIST \nWell, it’s over now and you’re safe, that’s all that matters. \nMARTIN \nNot quite... \nBASIRA \nMm-hmm. We do have another option to consider. \nARCHIVIST \nWhen we get back. I want to hear what the others have to say about it.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 0, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 4199}}
