Hello. (unsure laugh) ...What are you? \n[Hissing static ends] \nMARTIN (CONT'D) \n Do I, do I know you? Heh, can't… \nCan't tell through the, fog, sometimes. \n[Plastic and mic noises as Martin handles the tape recorder] \nMARTIN (CONT'D) \nYou feel… n-not friendly. Familiar? Shape of you in my hand. I talk to you, don't \nI? We talk. What do we, do we say? (under breath) Can't quite… \n[Chair creaks] \nMARTIN (CONT'D) \nTh-there's something there, but I just can't see it. \nAnyway. Ni-nice to sit down. Take a load off. \n[Chair scrapes on the floorboards] \nMARTIN (CONT'D) \nNot comfortable chair, of course. No-none of them are, here, I've-I've been all \nover this house looking for a nice place to sit. (unsure) I- think. Is that what I \nwas looking for? Um. Ei-either way, this place is so huge... so... empty, by the \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 170 – Recollection \n3 \ntime you find your way to anything at all, you've probably earned a sit-down. \n(unsure laugh) \n[Chair creaks] \nMARTIN (CONT'D) \nI don't think there's anyone else here— \nPro-probably never has been. Not that I can remember, at least. \nIs it my house? It must be, right? It must be my house, because, why else \nwould I be here? You don't just wander around other people's houses alone; \nyou don't just.... You don't just… just wander. \n(under breath) No… \n(Dazed) What, what was I saying? I don't… \n[Chair creaks; tape recorder handling] \nMARTIN (CONT'D) \nDo you remember? You store them, I suppose. Keep, keep stuff locked up in \nthose little wheels. That's memory, isn't it? Computers used to be like you. Big, \nwhirring things with loads of, uh, tape. They called that memory. But it's not, \nnot, not really; it's just numbers and... \nMaybe you're blank as well, same as me. Are you? Can you remember what \nI've already said, cause I… I, I can't; the words keep creeping away? Like, like-\nlike, when I when I, when I try to think back, to focus, um, focus on, um… \n[Hissing static starts] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 170 – Recollection \n4 \nMARTIN (CONT’D) \n(Pleasant) Oh, oh! Oh. Hello! \n[Hissing static ends] \n[Tape recorder handling] \nMARTIN (CONT’D) \nWhat are you; I can't quite, see. You feel… familiar. Do I know you, do we talk? \nI hope so. (slight laugh) It's good to talk with people. It's, hm. \nOh, I, I met someone; did I tell you? He's, I, I don't know. I like him. He doesn't \nlike me, though. Not really. I don't blame him. I don't like me sometimes, and I \nam me. Plus he's, he's my, my boss? Is that right? \nE, ei-either way, it's probably for the best. (adorkable) Wouldn't really be \nappropriate. You don't need to worry, I'm not doodling his name on my desk or \nanything, heh, his uh, his, his, um. His... name.... \nWait. \n[Chair squeaks] \nMARTIN (CONT'D) \nWait, what is his name? (distressed) I don't, wait, wh-wh-why can't I \nremember his name?
