This felt especially keen as we have ourselves been unable to conceive a \nchild, and so we felt it our duty to teach Wilhelm what we would have \nimpressed upon a son of our own. The profligacy of youth is always a danger, \nand we felt it our duty to help guide him, where we could, along the path of \nvirtue. We needn’t have worried ourselves overly: I have never met so sober \nand prudent a soul as seems to exist within young Wilhelm. Nonetheless, \nbecause of this we have remained close with my nephew through the years, \ndespite the distance. When he took ill this last winter, naturally we made \narrangements to travel to his home in the Schwarzwald and offer what comfort \nwe could. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG023 – Schwartzwald \n3 \n \nThe journey was difficult, as I suppose is to be expected when travelling in \nwinter, but Wilhelm’s condition brooked no delays. At first, the worst we had \nto contend with, coming from Bavaria, was the lack of provision in the inns \nwhere we took lodging, as we were told over and over again how rare guests \nwere this time of year. Still, say what you will about the German Confederation \n– and I know you certainly have a lot of opinions on that, my friend – but it has \nmade travelling a lot quicker and I was certainly grateful for that. When we \nentered Württemberg, however, our way was much harder. The snow fell \nthicker in the Schwarzwald, compelling us at last to trade the coach for a \nsleigh. \nYou have never known winter in the Black Forest, have you? I know that you \nwill say you have snows and forests in England, but I have seen what you call \nforests and can tell you that there can be no comparison to the Schwarzwald, \nits trees covered in a dense canopy of untouched snow. There is such a silence \nthere as I have never encountered anywhere else on earth, with every sound \nseeming to die the moment it touches that soft white blanket of virgin snow. \nBy day, it is the most beautiful serenity, this calm stillness. But by night, oh my \nfriend, by night it becomes something altogether else. The quiet of the forest, \nit becomes like the world is holding its breath, waiting to strike, and in those \nparts where the canopy clears enough that the moon shines down, it casts \neverything into the most ghostly shades. I lost count of the number of times I \nswore I saw figures in the shadows, briefly illuminated by the moonlit glow of \nthat frozen land. At one point I even demanded the sleigh be stopped so I \ncould make an examination of the area with a brace of pistols, but of course I \nfound nothing. It was in such a state of mind that we arrived at Wilhelm’s \nestate near Schramberg. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG023 – Schwartzwald \n4 \n \nWe were greeted by Wilhelm’s servants and told of their master’s condition. \nThe doctor had, apparently, braved the roads from Schramberg some few days \nago and had given what medicine he could. Since then, the servants told us, he \nhad been steadily improving, but was still very weak. I will confess at this news \nto feeling slightly unnecessary, but upon entering Wilhelm’s chamber, the \nhappiness evident upon his face when he saw Clara and myself put all such \nthoughts to rest. \nWilhelm was in recovery, but I had no intention of travelling back through that \nsilent, icy stillness unless absolutely necessary, and Clara agreed. We made \nplans to winter there with Wilhelm. There was room enough for us, though our \nchamber was more modest than what we would have been accustomed to. I \nwill admit that I didn’t entirely relish the though of staying in the Schwarzwald \nuntil the spring thaw, but of the courses of action we had at our disposal, it \nwas the one I found to be the most agreeable. \nAnd so began what was to be lengthy sojourn near Schramberg, and truly have \nI never wished more keenly that I had been able to bring my library with me. I \nhad but a few books with me and Wilhelm, despite his not-inconsiderable \nintelligence, had even fewer. In the end, we played a lot of cribbage and \nlistened to Clara play many a tune on the pianoforte. My wife has never had a \nsingular voice, but her skills upon the keys more than make up for it. I myself \nwould often take long walks through the surrounding woods during the early \nafternoon, when the cold was tolerable. Sometimes I would make my way the \ntwo miles to neighbouring Schramberg, but more often I would simply choose \na direction and stroll into the trees for as long as my fancy held me and then \nsimply fol", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 1, "chunk_count": 10, "chars": 4500}}
