While it’s now regarded as a cult classic, I still remember \nthe editorials at the time condemning it, and some even called it “the end of \nNeil Lagorio.” I think it was too late to officially be a “video nasty”, but it was \ncertainly referred to as such in the UK press. He told me later that he just \nneeded to get it out of his system, though I don’t know if I entirely believed \nhim. \nWhatever the case, my own relationship with him started in 1992, on the set of \nJewel of the Amazon, a mid-budget, effects-driven Kevin Costner vehicle. I’d \nbeen working in the industry only a couple of years by that point, and while I \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 136 – The Puppeteer \n8 \n \nhad always dreamed of working with Neil Lagorio someday, it wasn’t quite how \nI had always pictured it. The production was rushed, the budget was stretched, \nthe direction was uninspired and Neil seemed broadly miserable. Despite this, \nor maybe because of it, we became friends. I think we bonded on that shoot, \nsheltering from the rain for hours at a time, watching a soggy animatronic \njaguar gradually start to rust. I had to fight every instinct inside me, everything \nthat wanted to burst out in admiration for his work and his profound effect on \nmy life. But instead I chain-smoked and laughed, trying my best to come across \nas my hero’s peer. \nWhat was Neil Lagorio like? The question is harder to answer than I always \nthought it would be. In so many ways, he was his work. Conversations were \nusually about the current shoot, future projects or the most recent films of \nanyone he considered worth his attention. He had no time for whatever the \nissue of the day was, and despised Hollywood gossip and anyone who dealt in \nit. I will that say there was no warmth to him at all. He was not unpleasant or \ncruel, but beyond that you may as well have been talking to one of his steel \nand hydraulic creations. There were two sorts of people in the world, as far as \nNeil saw it: those who were worth his time, and those who were not. And if \nyou were in the latter group, he honestly couldn’t care if you lived or died. Not \nthat most people could tell which side of the line they fell on. There were even \ndays that I wasn’t sure myself. Sometimes, I remember, he would invite people \nover to his studio that I was sure he hated, for screenings of his “original cuts”. \nI was quite jealous of this at the time, as I’d never got such an invitation, but it \nwas probably for the best. I didn’t realise it back then, but those guests … They \nnever looked quite the same afterwards. \nWe stayed in touch over the next few years, even worked together on The", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 2, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 2712}}
