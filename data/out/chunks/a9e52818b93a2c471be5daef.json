I don't know how… I don’t know quite how to explain it, other \nthan to tell you that it opened its eyes. It opened all its eyes. \nThe next thing I remember is the police's arrival, and a lot of questions from \nofficers trying to hide the fact that they had just finished vomiting. The pile of \nmeat was gone, though the bits that had been nailed to the walls and floors \nremained. I told the police everything that I just told you, although they \ndismissed the last bit out of hand. I believe they had to call in a hazmat team in \nthe end. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG018 – The Man Upstairs \n10 \n \nThere's not much more to it, really. The rest of the story is largely arguing with \ninsurance companies and counting how many showers it took before I felt \nclean again. I did move out in the end, and now live in a house in Clapham with \nsome friends.

What we can be sure of is, \nthat on the evening of October the 22nd 2007, there was an incident at a first \nfloor flat in Welbeck House that involved hazardous biological material and led \nthe recovery of the body of one Toby Carlisle, the legal owner of the property. \nThe cause of death was listed as gangrene \nWe contacted Mr. Rudenko, who confirmed that since moving he had had no \nfurther experiences he believed to be linked to these events and after an \nextensive course of counselling was attempting to move past them. He did \ncorroborate the existing statement, though, saying he still believed it to be a \ntrue account of what happened to him. I'm not entirely sure I agree, although \nobviously there's little in the way of evidence to the contrary. \nOne thing puzzles me, however. Sasha managed to get access to some of Toby \nCarlisle's old financial records and it didn't appear like he had any real money \ncoming in, and what he did have was largely going to pay council tax on the \nproperty. There are no records of transactions at any supermarkets or online \ndelivery firms, and Tim even asked round some of the local butchers, as Martin \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG018 – The Man Upstairs \n11 \n \nis still off sick. At the end of all this, we've still been unable to answer one \nquestion: where was he getting the meat? I don't know why, but it bothers me. \nRecording Ends. \n[The Magnus Archives Theme - Outro] \n \nThe Magnus Archives is a podcast distributed by Rusty Quill and licensed under \na creative commons attribution, non-commercial share alike 4.0 international \nlicense.
