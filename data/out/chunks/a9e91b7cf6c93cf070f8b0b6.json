What are your thoughts. I’m keen to hear your own interpretation of this \none. My first assumption would have been the Flesh, based on the cannibalism \nand strangeness of the bodies involved, but- something about this idea of \nsome sort of famine world, its location within a man-made ruin, the whole… \nsocietal aspect of it- I’d be inclined to chalk this up as a genuine Extinction \nmanifestation. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 156 – Reflection \nBut I don’t know. Am I drawing wild conclusions, trying to fit the account into \nmy own preconceptions? Keen to know your feelings on the matter. \nOh. One more thing: If you do try to follow up with my source- and I know you \nhave your own ways of finding him, should you wish- please be careful. \nHe told me, near the end, that he had recently been worried he’s being \nfollowed. He keeps catching glimpses of a thin figure in the distance, or \ndisappearing around a corner, and I can’t quite get past the detail that there \nwas no reflection at all in the mirror he used to return. \nIf my suspicions are correct, there’s little either of us can do for him- but do \ntake care, if you make contact. \nMARTIN \nStatement ends. \n[He flips the paper over.] \nMARTIN (CONT’D) \n(Sighs) Another day, another Extinction scare. The more things change, I guess. \n(He sighs again.) \n[Static begins to fade in, quickly.] \nMARTIN (CONT’D) \nI just wish Peter would finally get round to telling me what we’re going to do \nabout it. \nPETER \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 156 – Reflection \nThen I have good news for you! \n(Martin sucks in a hard breath, and we hear what sounds like his chair \nscraping backwards in alarm.) \nMARTIN \n(Annoyed) Peter, we have talked about this! \nPETER \nIn my defence, it is still quite funny. \n(Martin takes an annoyed breath.) \nMARTIN \nSo. What’s the news? \nPETER \nI think we’re finally ready! \nMARTIN \n(Through gritted teeth) Great. Does that mean I finally get to know what we’re \nready for? \nPETER \nYes! Well- for the most part. To a certain degree, you really need to see it for \nyourself. \nMARTIN \nPeter. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 156 – Reflection \nPETER \nYou know the tunnels under the Institute? \nMARTIN \nY- Yes, I remember. \nPETER \nWell, there’s something at the centre, a- let’s call it a device. Now, our biggest \nproblem with the Extinction is a lack of information. We know it’s emerging, \nbut we don’t know how, or where. \nMARTIN \nAnd this... device will help? \nPETER \nYes. \nMARTIN \nAnd I’m going to be the one to use it for you. \nPETER \nI very much hope so. \n(Pause) If you need more time... \nMARTIN \nI don’t. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 156 – Reflection \nPETER \nGood, because I was going to say there probably isn’t any. \nMARTIN \nIf it’s been down there all this time, how come we haven’t found it? John \nexplored the tunnels pretty thoroughly, and Leitner was down there a lot. \nPETER \nIt’s very difficult to reach if you don’t know exactly where you’re going. \nMARTIN \nAnd you do? \nPETER \nI will. By tomorrow, I should have my hands on a map, and then- we go. \n(Pause.) \nMARTIN \n(Subdued) Right. \n(Beat.) Will I be coming back? \nPETER \nYou’re not going to die, if that’s what you’re asking, but- no. If all goes well, \nyou won’t be. \n(Martin takes a long inhale, then exhales.) \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 156 – Reflection \nPETER \nHow does that make you feel? \n[The static in the background adopts a bit more bass than usual, and the \nhigh-pitched scream-like tones increase in volume as well.] \nMARTIN \nNothing. (Short laugh) Nothing at all. \nPETER \nExcellent. I’m so proud of you, Martin. \nMARTIN \nI really don’t care. \nPETER \nPerfect. \n[Tape clicks off.] \n[The Magnus Archives Theme – Outro] \nJONATHAN SIMS \nThe Magnus Archives is a podcast distributed by Rusty Quill, and licensed \nunder a Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Share-Alike 4.0 \nInternational License. \nToday’s episode was written by Jonathan Sims and directed by Alexander J \nNewall.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 5, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 4215}}
