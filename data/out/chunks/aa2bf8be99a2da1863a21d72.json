Her whole body felt like it was made of glass, \nlocked in place but ready to shatter at any moment. Mr Bouchard had told her \nexplicitly, ‘Do not phone the police.’ But that woman, she’d been dressed as \npolice. And she had a gun. A-and Sims, she’d been practically dragging him. \nWhat was Rosie supposed to do, except wait for a gunshot that never came. \nThen the others arrived; Tim and that new girl. \n[Footsteps as Tim et al pass and enter the office; argument \ncontinues] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nShe wanted to warn them, to tell them something was wrong, but... what if it \nmade Mr Bouchard angry? Why did the thought of that terrify her so? He was \njust a man, and he’d never been anything but cordial to her. Did she need this \njob that badly? \nAt the back of her mind, her curiosity urged her to get closer, to try and hear \nwhat was being said. But this time fear locked her into her seat.

She knew. Finally her paranoia had \nnot been for nothing. She was working for evil. Not someone misguided, not \nselfish, but truly evil. And she knew she was going to sit there and ignore that \nfact. She knew the sort of information he had on everyone, and now she knew \nwhat he was capable of, what he might do if he thought Rosie might be a \nthreat. She was just going to sit there, watch, and hope to go unnoticed. And a \nsmall part of her, almost wanted to see what was going to happen. \n[Intercom switch clicks with Panopticon reverb] \n[Office sounds cease; replaced by distant and muffled current-day \nLondon: helicopters and crowd screaming] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nWhy doesn’t she do it?

She is perhaps the only person on \nEarth in a position to help, to at least ask what is happening, to ask why. But \nnow all she can do is sit there and smile, waiting for the intercom. \n[Intercom switch clicks with office reverb] \n[Current-day London sounds stop; replaced by office ambience and \nthe sounds of a police radio; footsteps and metal clicks as they \nwalk past her]", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 5, "chunk_count": 9, "chars": 3612}}
