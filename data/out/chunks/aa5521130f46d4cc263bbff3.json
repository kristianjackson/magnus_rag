The birds ceased their infernal chorus for a \nlong moment, as blood began to flow gently out from beneath the base, \npooling under that device that had haunted my dreams for fifteen years, then \nthey began again, louder and more furious than before. \n \nAt this, the machine moved once more, faster now, and with a shaking and \nshuddering that did nothing to slow its motion. It placed something upon the \ntable. I saw bellows, a wooden box, and a soft and hideous throat that seemed \nto twist and pucker on its own. Then the Mechanical Turk did something that I \ndo not believe will ever fully leave my thoughts no matter how fervently I \nmight wish it. \n \nIt stood up. \n \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG116 – The Show Must Go On \n \n11 \n \nIt had no legs and made no secret of it, yet still it stood, stepping away from \nthe table that was its very being, and it began to dance. As it did so, the \nbellows left upon the bleeding table started to pump, and I heard again that \nmournful wail of Wolfgang’s “speech machine” as the end of it flailed and \nbulged until at last it shrieked its words to the audience. I do not know what it \nsaid, and I thank almighty God that I speak no Hungarian. \n \nThere was then a moment of absolute nothing, wherein I swear that none of us \nexisted within the world. When I returned to being, the mouth upon the altar \nwas speaking English, but I no longer understood it, and I cried to the jailer in a \nlanguage all my own to let me out of my chair, but the chair was nothing but a \nstone and his face was too much of skin not to scream. The wooden man in the \nseat next to me tried to seize my hand but I no longer possessed any, so I \ncurled my legs into a fist and struck it again and again until my eyes were full of \nsweet sherry, and the part of me that sang no hymns bit down and choked \nupon the soft wood. I staggered, falling up onto the door and opening it to a \nscreaming clockwork heart that begged me to stop as I unscrewed it from its \nmoorings and set it adrift upon the sky that dropped away before me. Nothing \nwas anything, and nobody was what they did not pretend to be. I desperately \nwished to cry, but no longer had any understanding of what a tear was. \n \nAnd then there came a noise I did know. Into the nothing that was everything \ncame a thing that was most clearly a battle-cry, though I did not understand \nthe words of it, only the sense. I looked away to see inside a man who was a \nsoldier. I was sure he was a soldier and he was nothing but a soldier. His blades \nwere blades and forged for killing, and his mouth was a mouth and was made \nto order death. Beside him were four who were also soldiers, though their \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG116 – The Show Must Go On \n \n12 \n \nweeping eyes were empty sockets, and the captain led them by rope around \ntheir necks. They dragged a thing that wasn’t a thing, but instead a mouth \nupon a tree that hated the Turk and all it brought upon the world. The soldier \ncarved and cursed its way through a horde of vicious clockwork flesh-men with \nfaces that cannot not have been my father and shouted a command to the \nsightless followers that even I understood to be an order of attack. They took \nthe burning sun from their pockets and placed it upon the tree, and the mouth \nspat a curse so heavy it flew towards the altar and struck the Turk square in \nthe chest. \n \nAnd in that moment, everything was real once again. The sightless men and \nthe unknown soldier in his bloodied uniform turned and dragged the cannon \nfrom the theatre, paying no mind to the carnage that surrounded them on \nevery side, the limp and unmoving bodies of automata and patron alike, nor \nthe destruction they had wrought upon the stage. The cries and pleading of \nthe wounded and dying rose up like an awful chorus where before the air had \nbeen filled with the piping of metal birds. And God may damn me for a coward, \nbut I ran. \n \nGERTRUDE \nFinal comments. \n \nThe Stranger and its ritual have proved remarkably hardy in many ways, \nresistant to most of the standard interferences and flexible in such a way that, \nwhile the Unknowing is relatively easy to delay, full disruption seems \nborderline impossible.
