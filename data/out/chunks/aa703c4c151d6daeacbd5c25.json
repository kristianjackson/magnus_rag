Worst case scenario, the universe loses another monster. \nDAISY \nThat’s messed up. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 136 – The Puppeteer \n15 \n \nARCHIVIST \n(Laughs) Yeah. I suppose it is. \nDAISY \nDid you know the coffin wouldn’t kill you? \nARCHIVIST \nI guess I thought imprisonment wouldn’t ... wouldn’t be as bad as it was. And \nit’s a lot easier to make that choice than it is to actually endure the result. You \nmight have noticed, when I was in there with you, I had regrets. \nDAISY \nYeah, I remember. \nARCHIVIST \nPlus, I thought ... Well, I didn’t know what being down there had done to you. \nDAISY \nYou thought I was going to kill you? \nARCHIVIST \nIt was a possibility. \nDAISY \nGuess so. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 136 – The Puppeteer \n16 \n \nARCHIVIST \nDaisy? \nDAISY \nHm? \nARCHIVIST \nIt’s ... Uh ... Weird question, but I haven’t seen you in my dreams the last \ncouple of weeks? \nDAISY \nOh. No. I work here now. Figured it seemed to protect the others, so— \nARCHIVIST \nOh. Right. So, wait, did you talk to Lukas or— \nDAISY \nBroke into Elias’ old office. Found an employment contract. Filled it in and \nsigned it. \nARCHIVIST \nAnd that worked? \nDAISY \nSeems so. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 136 – The Puppeteer \n17 \n \nARCHIVIST \nAnd you’re not worried about...? \nDAISY \nBasira’s trapped here. So are you. Not like I’m going anywhere anyway. \nARCHIVIST \nI suppose not. So … no more dreams. \nDAISY \nNot of you and your weird eyes. Just the coffin. \nARCHIVIST \nIs that better? \nDAISY \nIt’s mine. \nARCHIVIST \nRight. \nDAISY \nYou need to stop moping. \nARCHIVIST \nI what? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 136 – The Puppeteer \n18 \n \nDAISY \nYou need to stop swanning around being all sad. \nARCHIVIST \nI am not swanning around. \nDAISY \n“Boo hoo, I’m so alone and a monster!” \nARCHIVIST \nI am alone. Martin is— \nDAISY \nBusy doing paperwork. Not like he’s dead. Besides, he’s not the only other \nperson here y’know. There’s me, Melanie, Basira ... \nARCHIVIST \nTraumatised, traumatised and paranoid. Because of me. \nDAISY \nGet over yourself. You’re always talking about choices. We all made ours. Now \nI’m making a choice to get some drinks in. Coming? \nARCHIVIST \nI don’t ... Yeah, ok. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 136 – The Puppeteer \n19 \n \nDAISY \nMelanie’s out, but I’ll go get Basira. \nARCHIVIST \nIs she ... Would she want to join us? \nDAISY \nIf she doesn’t, I’ll rip her throat out. \nARCHIVIST \nUhhh... \nDAISY \nIt’s a joke, John. \nARCHIVIST \n(Dubious) Oh, aha. Yes. I’ll get my coat. \n[Tape clicks off. Tape clicks on.] \nTHERAPIST \nRight, have a seat. Do you mind if I record our sessions? \nMELANIE \nI do mind, yes. \nTHERAPIST \nOh, I mean, it’s just for my own notes. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 136 – The Puppeteer \n20 \n \nMELANIE \nI categorically and completely do not give consent for you to make any \nrecording of me, ever. Turn it off. Please. \nTHERAPIST \nI, I see. Yes, of course. \n[Tape clicks off.] \n[The Magnus Archives Theme – Outro] \nThe Magnus Archives is a podcast distributed by Rusty Quill and licensed under \na Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Sharealike 4.0 International \nlicence. \nToday’s episode was written by Jonathan Sims and directed by Alexander J \nNewall. \nIt featured: Jonathan Sims as the Archivist, Lydia Nicholas as Melanie King, Fay \nRoberts as Daisy Tonner, and Helen Gould as the Therapist.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 6, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 3309}}
