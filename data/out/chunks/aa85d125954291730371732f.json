No tickets had been issued to me, nor had I seen \nany way in which they might have been acquired, but upon my approach, I \nnoted several other figures, finely garbed, making their way towards the \ntheatre with expressions that mirrored my own. The doors of the theatre were \nopen and standing either side of each entrance were things that on first \nappraisal appeared to be men. As I approached however, I recognised the stiff \nmotions and lifeless faces I had marked so sharply on the Turk. Dressed as \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG116 – The Show Must Go On \n \n9 \n \ngaudy footmen, automata silently gestured us inside with unnatural, jerky \nmotions of their arms and heads, so violent that I would have thought it no \nsurprise had they been hurled from their sockets. \n \nMore were within, and I was struck by the absence of any flesh and blood \nushers. Everywhere I turned there seemed to be more ticking, whirring figures \nof clockwork, wood and metal. Seeking some reassurance, I tried to make \nsome comment to another guest beside me, but found a cruel brass hand, \nawful in its strength, gripping me by the shoulder and leading me away. I was \nwalked to a balcony where I was, I supposed, to be seated. Fearful and \nconfused, I acquiesced to the silent instructions of, what I had begun to \nconsider, my captors. Even when other equally alarmed spectators were \nseated beside me, I refrained from addressing them, feeling as I did the \nunchanging faces of those mechanical beings staring down at me. \n \nBefore each seat there stood a small metal cage, within which hung a minute \nmechanical bird, as might be used to delight children. But the angles of the \ncreatures had been worked to a razor’s sharpness, and there was something in \nthe metal orbs that stood for eyes that I could not bring myself to look at. The \ntheatre fell silent, every seat filled with quiet watchers curious as to what \nmight be about to take place, but dreading the answer we were to receive. \n \nThen all eyes fell upon a figure in the centre of the stage, and I immediately \nrecognised the Mechanical Turk sat at its false table. Its head raised itself \nslowly, shuddering from side to side, and looked out over the assembled \ncrowd. Its coat was not as I had seen it, the fine fur now gone, and in its stead \nsomething hairy, coarse and brown that hung loosely about its shoulders. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG116 – The Show Must Go On \n \n10 \n \nThere was a single nod and a crack like brittle steel, and every false bird began \nto sing. It was not the gentle chimes of a hidden music box, rather the \nhorrendous piping wail of creatures in pain, at such a pitch and volume that it \nseemed no two birds could be anything but discordant. Had I dared raise an \narm I would have covered my ears, but I am certain that would have been no \nprotection. \n \nAs the sound echoed through my skull, I saw the Turk lift something inch by \ninch over its head. A long, curved sword was gripped in its rigid fingers, the \npoint aimed squarely at the chessboard in the table before it. The arm rose as \nthe chirping intensified to a scream. Then came a single, swift downward \nmotion of such force that it pierced right through the wood and buried the \nblade deep into the space beneath. The birds ceased their infernal chorus for a \nlong moment, as blood began to flow gently out from beneath the base, \npooling under that device that had haunted my dreams for fifteen years, then \nthey began again, louder and more furious than before. \n \nAt this, the machine moved once more, faster now, and with a shaking and \nshuddering that did nothing to slow its motion. It placed something upon the \ntable. I saw bellows, a wooden box, and a soft and hideous throat that seemed \nto twist and pucker on its own. Then the Mechanical Turk did something that I \ndo not believe will ever fully leave my thoughts no matter how fervently I \nmight wish it. \n \nIt stood up.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 3, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 4125}}
