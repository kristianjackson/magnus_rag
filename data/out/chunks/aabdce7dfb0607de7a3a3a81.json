Still, I had some vague memories of their being an Oxfam charity \nshop somewhere nearby, as I’d previously bought quite a nice old military tunic \nthere which remains one of my favourite jackets. I found it without any \nproblems and spent ten minutes or so looking over the clothes and \nknickknacks, but was a bit disappointed. It was smaller than I remembered and \njust seemed to contain the same tedious curios as every other charity shop. I \nstill had some time to kill, though, so I decided to have a look through their \nbooks, something I rarely bother doing usually. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG004 – Page Turner \n3 \n \nI found the book on the Science Fiction and Fantasy shelf. At first I assumed it \nwas some sort of faux-leather special edition and I was sure whoever put it out \nfor sale must have done the same, because the price on it was only four \npounds. There was something about it that made me take another look, \nthough, and picking it up I felt the binding and realised it might well have been \nbound in real leather, probably calf, given how soft it was. I’m not an expert on \nbooks, by any means, but it seemed old, and I thought it might have been \nhand-bound as the pages were slightly uneven. There was no dust wrapper on \nit and the front had no title, but embossed on the spine in faded gold letters \nwere the words Ex Altiora. I did some Latin in school when I was a child, but I \nhaven’t had much cause to use it since, so you’ll have to forgive me if my \ntranslations don’t make much sense, but I believe it meant “From Higher” or \n“Out of the Heights”. \nI was astounded to say the least – the book was clearly worth far more than it \nwas being sold for. If the shop clerk who put it out had been paying any \nattention it would have been in the glass case where they kept those things \npeople donated that were actually valuable. I had a flick through but it seemed \nto be entirely written in Latin, so I didn’t have much luck discerning what it was \nabout. The only English seemed to be a bookplate at the front that read “From \nthe library of Jurgen Leitner” although no author was listed. There were also \nseveral black and white illustrations - woodcuts I think - each showing a \nmountain or a cliff or in one picture what appeared to be an empty night sky. I \nfelt an odd sensation when I looked at that image as though, simple as it was, I \nwas about to fall into it, and my stomach gave an odd jolt, almost causing me \nto drop the book in the middle of Oxfam. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG004 – Page Turner \n4 \n \nI made up my mind to buy it. Even if I never figured out how to read the thing, \nit was clearly worth a lot more than they were selling it for. I felt like bit of an \narse for not letting them know how valuable it was, almost like I was stealing \nmoney from the charity, but in the end I realised that it wasn’t my job to set \nthe prices in this shop and besides, this book absolutely fascinated me. The \nwoman working the till didn’t even raise an eyebrow when I brought it over \nand paid my four pounds. I headed out, hoping to find a café where I could sit \nand have another look through, but it was then that I noticed the time. I had \nsomehow managed to spend an hour in that shop, and now I was very nearly \nlate for Katherine’s play. I made it in time, luckily, though Ihad to run a bit. \nThe show was fine. I’ve never been a particular fan of Greek plays, and this \ninterpretation was not the one to win me round to them. Katherine was \nexcellent, of course, but the rest of the show was quite frankly a bit pedestrian. \nStill, I’m not a theatre critic, and I wasn’t exactly paying it my full attention, as I \nwas convinced there was a problem with the stage lights. Throughout the show \nI kept getting the faintest smell of ozone and was worried. The only other time \nI’d smelled that in the theatre was when one of my stage hands had \naccidentally ordered the wrong sort of light and we’d ended up installing a \nprojector with a xenon-mercury lamp – the sort used to sterilise medical \nequipment with UV. I spotted the issue before anything happened, but I still \nremember that intense ozone smell. Still, no-one else seemed to notice it and I \ncouldn’t see anything in their light set-up that would have caused the odour, \nso I tried my best to ignore it. \nAfter the performance was finished, Katherine and I grabbed", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 1, "chunk_count": 10, "chars": 4500}}
