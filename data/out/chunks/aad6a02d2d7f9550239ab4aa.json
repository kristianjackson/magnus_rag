They wanted \nto see if they could use ESP to scare her. I told you it sounded like a set-up to a \nhorror movie, right? I don’t know how they didn’t see that. I mean, maybe they \ndid. Maybe they went ahead with it for the same reason I joked with Laura \n\nabout it instead of requesting a transfer. You come to relish the ghoulishness \nof it, because deep down you know it’s safe. The worst that might happen \nwould a few upset students. It should have just been an idle flight of fancy. \nNow, I can’t really speak to what happened for the majority of the study. For \nobvious reasons I wasn’t cleaning the rooms in question while they were doing \nthe tests, but heard a few bits and pieces about it from Liz and some of the \nother researchers. It seemed to be going well to begin with. Annabelle was \ndisplaying some subtle but statistically significant signs of distress and unease \nwhile the spiders were being shown. Signs that were noticeably absent during \nthe control periods. \nI know that the fear reactions were certainly serious enough for the poor souls \nthat had unwittingly signed up as projectors: I had to clean up when one of \nthem was sick during the first round of testing. He had to leave the \nexperiment, if I remember. Lucky sod. \nI’m sure you can guess what I ended up cleaning more and more of over the \ncourse of the study. Cobwebs. I mean, you can’t avoid them in buildings with \nhigh ceilings and inviting corners, but even so, there were more and more of \nthem each day. I’d brush or hoover them away in an evening only to find them \nreturned the next morning, thicker than ever. \nI never got a good look at the spiders behind them. Unlike most of the ones \nI’ve seen, sitting fat and proud in the centre of their web, the most I ever saw \nof these ones would be a quick scuttle of dark legs disappearing into a hole in \nthe plaster or behind a wall installation. It creeped me out plenty, but in a good \nway, I thought. I knew that, logically, they were just escaping the winter. I \nmean, you know how cold it’s been these last few weeks. \n\nI’d try to spook Liz, telling her how her dark experiments were summoning up \nan army of spiders. I had no idea. The tests were progressing, and they had \nstarted introducing multiple projectors at once to see how it affected the \nintensity of the feelings Annabelle was receiving. Liz was very excited by the \nresults. I can still remember her face as she told me that Annabelle had \napparently reported having several unsettling dreams about spiders. \nNotably, at no point in the experiment had she been informed that it was \nspiders being used. Liz was excited, telling me how the dreams seemed to map \nvery well to the physiological responses they had been recording; how \nAnnabelle had dreamed of “tiny legs running along her veins like a web”. It was \nthen they started to have problems, though. \nWhile adding additional projectors had at first increased the severity of the \nresponses, it seemed this had very quickly tapered off, and soon the \nmeasurements had changed significantly. They were still getting noticeable \nresponses but they weren’t like the ones they had gotten before. They didn’t \nappear to be fear. Liz was irritated by this as, even though the results still \nlooked good for a general ESP study, the variation in response tone would \napparently muddy the research in ways she wasn’t keen on. \nI only saw Annabelle Cane once during this period. She wasn’t hard to pick out. \nShe dressed like a vintage clothing store exploded on her, and her short \nbleach-blonde hair stood out sharply against dark skin. The first time I saw her \nI’d liked her. She looked like the kind of student who occasionally talked to \ncleaners like we were people. Not that we ever actually spoke, but she had \nthat air about her.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 2, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 4245}}
