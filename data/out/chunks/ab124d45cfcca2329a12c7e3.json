It’s still raining.] \n(The Archivist’s breathing is still audible.) \n[There is a strange laughter. A different door opens.] \nMICHAEL \nOh… Oh…. Oh, Archivist. What have you done now? It’s almost sad to see you \nlike this. \n(The Archivist groans.) \nMICHAEL \nAlmost. I’ve come to a decision, Archivist. I’m going to kill you. \n(The Archivist makes a noise of frustration.) \nMICHAEL \nIt’s earlier than I had hoped, but that’s life… I suppose. Your life. [Giggles] \nBefore I do, however, I want you to understand… even if it does go against my \nnature. So. \n(The Archivist gasps as the gag is taken off.) \nMICHAEL \n(Slowly, deliberately.) Ask your questions. \nARCHIVIST \nWhat? \n\nMICHAEL \nAsk me. \nARCHIVIST \nH-How did you find me? \nMICHAEL \n(Laughs) The Eye watches, and the Stranger conceals, but me... I lie, Archivist. I \nam the throat of delusion incarnate. They can’t hide you from me. \nARCHIVIST \nWhat do you have to do with the Unknowing? \nMICHAEL \nNothing. (Laughs) Nothing whatsoever. Except perhaps that I would like it to \nfail. \nARCHIVIST \nSo… wh— Why are you here? \nMICHAEL \nI already said. To kill you. \nARCHIVIST \nBut-But why? \nMICHAEL \n\nBecause I don’t want the Circus to win. And I don’t want the Archives to either. \nKilling you myself... it’s the best of both. And of course there’s revenge. \nARCHIVIST \nRevenge? I still don’t even know who you are! \nMICHAEL \nI am Michael. I was not always Michael. I do not want to be Michael. Being \nMichael stole the only purpose I have ever known. \nARCHIVIST \nYou were Gertrude’s assistant, weren’t you? \nMICHAEL \nNo. \nARCHIVIST \nBut, but the tape— I heard you. \nMICHAEL \n(Slowly.) No. You heard Michael. \nARCHIVIST \nI… What the hell are you talking about?! \nMICHAEL \n\nQuiet, Archivist. The cramped casket sings loud, but not loud enough to drown \nout screaming. The Michael on that tape was not me. When that person was \nMichael, I was something else, and now I am Michael and that person is gone. \nARCHIVIST \nSo, what… You... you became him? \nMICHAEL \nNo more than he became me. It is rare that someone I take finds their way into \nbeing me, but it does happen. And Michael had help. \nARCHIVIST \nWhat happened? \nMICHAEL \nHm… Ahhh, a statement. Of course. Is your recorder running? Yes. Say it, \nArchivist. \nARCHIVIST \nStatement of... Michael. Taken from subject. Date... \nMICHAEL \nThe last day of the Archivist’s life. \nARCHIVIST \nStatement begins. \nMICHAEL (STATEMENT) \n\nHow far back should it go? To the beginning of me? Centuries? Millennia? How \nyou define the start of your being when in some ways you have always been? \nTime is difficult to form. Michael Shelley, though, he is easier to keep track of. \nHe was born. He was pointless. And he should have died. But before that could \nhappen, he went to work for the Magnus Institute – that ivory tower, keeping \nits prisoners ignorant in pursuit of… knowledge. (Laughs) A dungeon full of \nidiot watchers. And Michael Shelley was no exception. \nWhen he was in school, he lost a friend to something like me. His friend was \nnamed Ryan, but those in power simply called him schizophrenic. I don’t know \nif he was, but it doesn’t matter. He was so dreadfully afraid his world wasn’t \nreal that to make it so was almost nothing. Michael was there when he taken; \nhe never got over what he saw. Or didn’t see. After much searching and \ndespair, it drove him into the waiting arms of the Institute, where he met \nGertrude Robinson. The Archivist. \nEven being what I am, I have rarely seen anyone so adept at distorting the \ntruth as Gertrude Robinson. Michael was protective of the frail old woman he \nbelieved her to be. So… so delicate, so forgetful, yet gently wise. He cared for \nher. He trusted her. And she fed him to me. She made him me to destroy our \ntranscendence. And she did not hesitate. \nPoor Michael. He had been on trips for the Institute before. Conferences, \ninvestigations, Gertrude had made sure that all her assistants were ready. That \nnone of them would be suspicious if they were told they were going abroad for \nwork. So, there was no doubt in his mind, no concern, when she told him that \nthey were travelling to Russia. Perhaps if he’d have stopped to look up their \ndestination, he might have discovered there was no such place as Zemlya", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 1, "chunk_count": 5, "chars": 4295}}
