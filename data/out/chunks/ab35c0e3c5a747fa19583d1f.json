I began to feel very uneasy at this point, but whatever \npowers of persuasion the vampire had calmed me enough to continue \nfollowing it with my brother. \nWe went up the stairs and I was led to a small room with a bed in it. I was \nmade to understand that this would be my room and was left there as Sylvia \nMcDonald led my brother away to the room next to it. When it returned it \nbrought a bowl of fruit and offered it to me. The fruit was clearly a few weeks \nold and in various stages of rotting, but just to appease the thing I found an \napple and a couple of grapes that seemed edible and I ate them. It watched me \nsilently the whole time and then turned and walked out towards Nigel’s room. \nBy this time whatever the creature had done to make me compliant seemed to \nbe starting to wear off, and I was realising just how wrong everything was. I \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG010 – Vampire Killer \n6 \n \nwas also realising that it didn’t look like there was any easy escape from the \nhouse. All the windows I had seen were barred, and I recalled Sylvia McDonald \nhad locked the sturdy-looking front door behind it after we had all entered. So \ninstead I just laid down in the old musty bed and I waited. \nCouldn’t rightly say what I was waiting for, but soon enough it got dark and I \nassumed Sylvia McDonald had gone to sleep, not yet realising the manner of \nbeing that I was dealing with. I wanted some light to comfort me but the old \nhouse seemed to have no electricity at all, so I used my cigarette lighter on a \ncandle I found next to the bed and crept towards the door. It wasn’t locked, \nthankfully, and I left the room assigned to me and walked over to where I \nbelieved my brother was. I went in and found him lying in his own bed, \npretending to sleep. After a bit of talk it became clear that Nigel was no \nhappier with our situation than I was and we both resolved that another night \non the cold streets was better than staying with this strange woman. As we \ntalked through possible ways to escape, however, we heard a rustling sound \noutside the door, and the handle began to turn. Not wanting to anger our \nstrange host, I crawled under the bed to hide, while Nigel returned to \npretending to sleep. \nFrom my vantage point under the bed, I could see the door open and the skirt \nof Sylvia McDonald enter and move towards the bed. I simply laid there and \ntried not to make a sound. I am not proud of this and sometimes have a \ncertainty that my inaction led directly to my brother’s death, but most of the \ntime I accept that if I had alerted the vampire to my presence then I would also \nhave died. Either way, the fact of the matter is that I did nothing as I heard the \nsounds of a struggle overhead and Nigel’s strangled cry.
