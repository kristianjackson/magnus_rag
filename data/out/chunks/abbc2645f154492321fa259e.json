When you read this, I would \nconsider it a great favour if you could share my words with the head of your \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 135 – Dark Matter \n \n2 \n \ninstitute. Tell him that Maxwell Raynor sends his regards and offers sanctuary. \nA time of holy darkness is at hand, when the eye will close forever, and in the \nspirit of the friendship they once shared, he offers an opportunity to \nsurrender. Forsake the Ceaseless Watcher, abandon your position, and you \nshall be spared in the blind world to come. In this spirit of reconciliation, and to \nconvince you of our sincerity, I offer my story, much as it may pain me to feed \nthe sick voyeur that lurks in this place. \nMy parents were very religious, fuelled with a zealotry and zeal that only now I \nam beginning to truly understand.

It didn’t save them, of course, and when they lay there dying, \nI saw in their faces the fear that they had always denied, the confidence in \ntheir own salvation fading with each step closer to the end. For a long time, I \nhoped that they had been right about their beliefs. I remembered in my heart \nthat deep down they were vicious, spiteful people who used their faith to hurt \nothers, and I fondly imagined them discovering themselves in an afterlife other \nthan the one they had assumed as their destination. But I know longer think of \nsuch things. \nThe core of their hatred was for anything they saw as ‘unnatural’. To them, \nGod’s creation was perfect, and all things in nature were right and proper \naccording to His will. Of course, there was little consistency in what they \nconsidered to be ‘natural’, and it always seemed to fall along the lines of their \nown petty jealousies and pride. Anything they did not understand became \nunnatural, and I found myself crossing that line from an early age, although", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 0, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 2767}}
