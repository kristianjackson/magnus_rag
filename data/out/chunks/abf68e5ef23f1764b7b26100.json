Sleep was only a memory, \nbecause even the prospect of unconsciousness might have made his present \nstate slightly more bearable. Food as well he knew must be a thing, for he \ncould feel the hunger, but his imagination failed to picture it. The only smell he \nknew was the damp and the dirt. \nBut these things, grim and fearful as they were, were not unfamiliar. The \naching hunger was not new, not simply a gift of the eager soil. He had flashes \nof an empty belly not assuaged by hands, cracked and calloused from long, \ngrim hours of labour. There was a shadow in his mind of sleepless nights, spent \ntoiling, tired and shaking, desperate for some relief from the relentless \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 166 – The Worms \n11 \npressure that crushed the life of the man who had been Sam, before he was a \nworm. \nAnd a worm he surely was, for what else could spasm, crawling limbless \nthrough the ground, millimetre by millimetre, making its lonely way towards \nsome secret destination no human could understand? Perhaps he did still have \narms or legs or the luxury of both, but down here it was impossible to tell, \npressed so close together that to draw a line between a torso and a folded, \nbending limb was pointless. If it moves like a worm, thinks like a worm, and \nscreams its awful agonies towards the distant, taunting sky like a worm… well, \nthe conclusion is obvious. Sam's pale, mottled worm-flesh pressed and \nsqueezed its way ever forward, ever upwards, or so he hoped. So he begged. \nThe light was there; it was always there. So small and far it might have been a \nsingle pinprick in a pitch-black curtain. Just enough to remind him he had eyes, \nstarved and hollow though they were. Just enough to remind him that there \nwas such a thing as sky, that the endless, open air existed. Enough to kindle in \nhim the fear that he might never see it again. Worms don't get to see the sky. \nIf he had slept, he would have dreamed of it, of flying through the light and \nunchained breeze, mocking the ground that he had always and forever \nescaped. Another good reason he was not allowed to sleep. \nSometimes, when he bent his neck and gazed longingly upwards towards the \nlight, he could feel something looking back, its vision stretching out and down \nand through the opaque mud to touch him, drinking in his panic and \ndiscomfort as he tried yet again to push himself up and out. He would call, \nthen, desperately imploring the very thing that revelled in his suffering to end \nit. As he did so, he sometimes remembered dimly other pleas made in the \nopen air to other forces keen to profit from his degradation. Forces of paper \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 166 – The Worms \n12 \nand ink and decimal points. But such memories are brief and gone as Sam's \nlungs fill once again with sod. \n[Faint muffled screams start] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nHis scream, though short, echoes up and through the rough-hewn tunnel, \njoined as it rises with the cries of a hundred others, erupting from the holes \nthat pockmark the rotten field in a cacophony, a stomach-churning harmony of \ndirt-caked shrieking. Then just as quick as it begins, it is done, and the only \nones who will ever hear Sam's screams are the ones who have entombed him. \n[Faint muffled screams stop] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nCan he feel the warmth, from that distant spot of light, a ray of sun down there \nin the dark? The poor man's not to know the sun is gone, that what now \nremains is to serve no other purpose than to let this wretched world be seen. A \nlifeless, hollow illumination barely worth the name of light. But down there in \nthe dark and icy ground, Sam still clings hard to his dream of the Sun, and the \nground lets him, of course, for what true fear can exist without hope, without \nthe belief that things might change for the better? To tug at the knowledge \nthat they will only get worse? \nWhen he has the will, when the cold soil around him has been still and silent \nfor long enough, Sam may once again begin his grim and painful climb. Moving, \nsquirming along by the merest fractions of a millimetre afforded by his \npressing prison, he claws and digs in what might have once been fingers.
