Could have been worse, of course; if the rain \nhadn’t almost liquefied the mud of no man’s land I’d have gone up like a \nlucifer. I did start to notice something among the troops, though. Every time \nwe lined up to go over the top I would watch them, look into their faces. Most \nof them showed naught but the starkest fear, of course, but a few of them \nseemed distant. The whistle would startle them back to themselves and with \nwide eyes they would surge forward. I had seen this before all that business \nwith Wilfred but had always assumed it was simply the mind trying to choke \ndown the likelihood of its own death. Now when I watched, I found I could not \nhelp but notice the slight tilt of the head, as though gently straining their ears \nto hear a far-off tune. Those men never made it back to the trenches. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG00X – The Piper \n9 \n \nYou know the phrase “to pay the piper”. I thought on it a lot through those \nmany months – the debt of Hamelin, who for their greed had their children \ntaken from them, never to be returned. Did you know Hamelin is a real place in \nGermany? Yes, not too far from Hanover as I recall. We had a prisoner once \nfrom there – I wanted to ask him about the old fairy tale and what, if anything, \nhe knew of The Piper. The poor soul didn’t speak a word of English, though, \nand died from an infected shrapnel wound a few days later. He spent his last \nminutes humming a familiar tune. That night, as we scrambled through mud \nand broken metal in another futile attack I began to wonder: were we the \nchildren stolen from their parents by The Piper’s tune? Or were we the rats \nthat were led to the river and drowned because they ate too much of the \nwealthy’s grain? Still, those are musings for poets, among whom I do not \nnumber. I did keep up with Wilfred’s work, though, and was startled to see \nhow much it had changed since he left. Where once it could have been \ndismissed as frivolous, there was now a tragedy to it that flowed from the \nwords. Even now I can’t hear Exposure without being back in that damned \ntrench at wintertime. And the public clearly felt similar, as one of the few \nnewspapers we actually got through to the line had an extensive article \npraising his first collection. Despite all this, there was something about it that \nsat uneasily with me. \nWilfred returned to the 2nd Manchesters in July of 1918. He was clearly much \nchanged from his time away, and seemed to be in good enough spirits, though \nwe talked little any more, and when he looked at me, I saw in his eyes a fear \nthat he was quick to hide. The war was grinding towards a close at this point. \nThere was a fatigue that could be felt everywhere; even the enemy machine \nguns felt slower and more begrudging in their fire, but this charged our \ncommanders to spur us on to more and more aggressive actions.
