Used \nto be they only ever hired the hall out for weddings, parties, occasional public \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 126 – Sculptor’s Tool \n2 \n \nevents, but about five, six years ago they got a new organiser in, Jenny. Lovely \nwoman. Young. Very keen to make the community centre just that: the centre \nof the community. So, she put together this huge program of adult education \nclasses. Mostly just the standard stuff – dance, life drawing, yoga, computer \nskills – but there were a few that were a bit more out there. They had a \ncheesemaking course that ended with us all bringing in our somewhat less-\nthan-successful cheeses and trying to pair them with wines. Still amazed no-\none got food poisoning from that one. And there was a fire-eating workshop \nonce. I didn’t go to that one. \nAnyway, I’d become great friends with Jenny through the church choir, and \nsince George was off to university and Rosa was usually working evenings, I \ntended to be alone until about ten or eleven most days. So obviously I started \ngoing to as many classes as I could. It was a great way to meet friends, learn \nnew skills and, as she always reminded me, spend a good portion of Rosa’s \npaycheque. \nNow, about a year after Jenny had taken over, the workshop schedule started \nlisting a bi-weekly sculpting class, which was great news, because I’d been \ntelling Rosa just the day before that life drawing and watercolours were all \nvery well, but I really like to get a bit more hands on with making art. Then \nRosa made an off-colour joke about life drawing and getting ‘hands on’ and I \nforgot about it, but I still ended up going to the class. \nThere were only a few of us learning to sculpt, probably because the class had \nquite a high materials’ cost and was a bit earlier than the others. There was \nme, Mary, who works at the post office, Bill, who I knew from walking his dog, \nand Ray Quinton, who was actually teaching the class, though I didn’t know \nhim outside of that. And then there was… him.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 0, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 2753}}
