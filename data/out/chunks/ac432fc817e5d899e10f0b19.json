He was a young guy, white \nand, from what I could tell, Scottish. I never really got more than his name out \nof him: Sean Kelly. He had the bunk opposite me, and we were on different \nshifts, so I would often see him lying there when I returned from my night \nwatch. He didn’t talk any more than the others, but he also didn’t go around \nwith that blank look on his face. He looked scared. \nThere were other odd things about the ship, but hands down the weirdest \nthing, I didn’t notice until a few days out into the Atlantic. Now one of my \nduties was to check the deck containers were securely in place, none of the \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG033 – Boatswain’s Call \n10 \n \ntwistlocks or lashing rods had broken or come loose. It was usually just \nbusywork – I’d never been on a ship that lost a container, though it does \nhappen. This shift, though, I noticed something wrong. I saw that one of the \nlashing rods, towards the stern, had broken. And not at one of the ends, or the \ntwistlock itself, but right in the middle of what should have been solid metal. \nFrom a distance it looked fine, new paint shining in the sun, but looking closer I \nsaw that it had rusted all the way through. Not just that, but checking out \nwhere the rod connected to the container, it became clear that they had \nrusted together. Fresh paint covered up most of it, but once I knew what I was \nlooking for I saw it everywhere. The shipping containers, all of them, were \nrusted in place. How could this have happened, though, if they were being \nchanged over at port? How long had the Tundra been sailing with the same \ncargo? \nI decided I had to look inside. Stupid, maybe. If it was something illegal, they \nmight toss me overboard first and ask questions never, but only if I got caught. \nAnd I was just about sick of nasty surprises. \nI did it on my next late shift. I kept an eye on the rest of the crew and waited \nfor my moment. I’d already marked out a ground level container where the \npadlock had practically rusted off. It wouldn’t be difficult to get it open. It was \nabout 3am when I had my chance. I was alone on deck and the wind was \nhowling loud enough to muffle the groan of the container’s rusted hinges. It \ntook three kicks from my steel toecaps to get it open, but finally I was able to \nget the door ajar. It was so stiff it took almost all my strength to get enough of \na gap to walk through, but finally I could see inside. \nIt was completely empty. There was no sign of cargo, or any markings or debris \non the floor that might have shown there had ever been anything inside. I \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG033 – Boatswain’s Call \n11 \n \ncouldn’t believe it, a transport ship with nothing to transport? It didn’t make \nany sense. I managed to bust two other containers open, but they were the \nsame. As far as I could tell, every container on the ship was empty. \nI was still trying to figure out what this could mean when I saw a couple of \ntorches approaching. I almost panicked and ran, but where exactly was I going \nto escape to? The empty, uncaring ocean stretched out for hundreds of miles \nin every direction. So instead I swallowed my fear, and pushed the door careful \nclosed, trying my best to hide the broken lock before making my way onto the \ndeck. \nI was met by the mate and a half dozen other crewmen behind him. He looked \nat me for a second, then nodded and told me to follow, then he continued \nwalking. Confused, I headed after them as they made their way around the \nship, silently collecting up or waking all the rest of the crew. I started to ask \nwhat was going on, but the glares I got shut me right up. Finally, when we had \nwhat looked like the whole crew together, we walked over to the lifeboat. \nNow we definitely weren’t sinking, so I hadn’t really paid much attention to the \nlifeboat before, but now I looked at it, I realised it wasn’t what I’d have \nexpected. Most modern container ships have a lifeboat that looks more like a \nlumpy orange blob than a boat. They’re designed to be quickly and safely \ndropped into the water and tough out whatever conditions the sea might \nthrow at them. But this was an old fashioned boat, with oars and a winch \nmechanism for lowering it into the water. It didn’t even look like it had any \nsupplies in it. Standing there in front of it was Captain Lukas, as silent as the \nrest of his crew. \nThe Captain nodded, and one by one the crew of", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 4, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 4499}}
