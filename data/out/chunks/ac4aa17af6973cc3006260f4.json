We’re all snoops now! \n[Helen walks to her door and opens it] \nHELEN (CONT’D) \nCiao! \n[Her footsteps echo in a corridor as she leaves, closing the door \nbehind her] \n[The high-pitched tone ends] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 183 – Monument \n11 \n(Beat) \nARCHIVIST \n(Apologetically) Martin… \nMARTIN \nAre there people, John? \nARCHIVIST \nWhat? \nMARTIN \nAre there people in my domain? \nARCHIVIST \nNot many. \n(Inhale from Martin) \n(Beat) \nMARTIN \nDo you need to do your… your thing? Make a statement about whatever’s \ngoing on in there? \nI could use a moment to think. \nARCHIVIST \nSure thing. Yeah. I’ll... \nYeah. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 183 – Monument \n12 \n[Martin walks away] \n[Hissing static starts] \n[The sound of shifting, sliding, stone becomes clear and from all \nsides, accompanied every so often by the sound of large \nmechanisms and gears] \n[Hissing static starts] \nARCHIVIST \nThey scratch and scrape and scamper down the halls of icy granite, fingers that \nend in jagged nailss probing— \n[Hissing static ends] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \n—eager, desperate for the wide and stately passages of marble they are so \nconvinced are just around the corner. This corner? No, the next one? Surely \nsoon, it must be soon, yes, I have simply misplaced it for a moment. \nThey scrabble over smoothly shifting steps that grow and shrink to hidden \nwhims, and argue about the angle with nobody. If they are feeling very \nconfident, they may lean down and stretch a curious tongue beyond their \nchipped teeth and rotten gums, desperate to add another sense to their \nobservances, more evidence to support their declaration of what the world \nmust be. Their beards are long and matted with their prevaricating spittle, and \ntheir hair is kept loose, hanging over their faces to hide the looks of confusion \nand fear. \nThere is a way out of here. There must be a way out of here. There is a pattern \nto the movements, an unseen system to the shifting of the doors and the \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 183 – Monument \n13 \nopening of the tunnels. It simply takes observation and thought and patience \nand, above all else, intelligence. And that is what these men have in \nabundance. Intellects sharpened to the keen edge as a chef might sharpen \ntheir knife. They have spent their lives in holy objectivity, cleaving one Gordian \nKnot after another in the arena of publication and debate. They must simply \nstudy and learn if they are to escape the labyrinth. They will be the first to \nescape. \nThe one who sits in the central chamber cannot remember his name. But he \nknows that people called him ‘doctor’. He made sure of that — to ignore it \nwould have been the greatest disrespect and he will not be disrespected. \nDoctor...uh, something, has been waiting here for a long time, observing, \ntiming the rotations of the passageways above him. He knows for a fact that \nthis is the central chamber because he is the one sat here. For his observations \nto make any sense they must be made from the centre of this place, and this is \nwhere he is observing from, so it stands to reason that it is the centre. The only \nfirm and solid place in a cacophony of undulating architecture; the only point \nfrom which it may be solved. \nHow long has he been watching now? Scratching his notes and formulae into \nhis skin with a fragment of splintered obsidian. It does not matter, time means \nnothing in the pursuit of knowledge, and he has no concerns except the \nsolution. And he has cracked it. His mouth breaks into a smile, lip splitting in \nthe grin, spilling a drop or two of scarlet onto skin so pale as to now be near-\ntranslucent. He has seen the others pointlessly wandering the halls, of course. \nSimpering pretenders claiming to see patterns when they are only being led by \nthe siren call of their pathetic little biases.
