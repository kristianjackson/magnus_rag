Who they are, who \nthey were, these details are lost to us. But they’re also lost to them. \nSometimes they get flashes, moments of people they might have been. \nPhantom pasts, the ghosts of happy futures, but they’re empty, and vanish if \nthey try to hold them. \nOne of them is young, though he has always felt old. He has always felt tired. \nHe has stood apart from everyone who ever cared for him and never felt the \ndistance. His family were cold, and so to keep that coldness at bay, he built a \ntowering wall between them and him. He hid it in jokes and practiced smiles, \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 186 – Quiet \n \n23 \nbut on a cloudy day they could see it. And when he was able to leave his family \nbehind, that wall came with him, following him, keeping out the world. \nHe would walk the streets of the city at night and wish the world away, so it \ncould be just him, with no-one to know him or judge him or hurt him. \nSometimes, when the emptiness inside began to bite, he reached out for \npeople, and took a friend or a lover. But when he did it was only to watch them \nbeat themselves again and again against that wall until they finally relented, \nand he was alone once more. He told himself it was for the best. He told \nhimself he liked it like that. \nAnd now he is here. The wall still surrounds him, though now it encircles all the \nfields where he staggers, wet from the rain, and cold from the wind. He calls \nout for somebody to see him, for somebody to know how achingly hollow he \nis. He walks and walks and walks, desperate for another voice, for someone to \nknow where he is and what he’s going through, but he can’t shout too loud. If \nhe does, he feels the thick grey mulch rising from where it has settled in the \nhollow of his chest. It pushes up his throat and streams from his mouth instead \nof words. It is clouded and so bitterly cold that where it lands the scrubland \ngrass turns brittle and crumbles away, leaving only ice, pulled from the deepest \nparts of him, hardened and crusted into a smooth, dark mirror, reflecting his \nlined and careworn face against the clouded sky. The rain pricks his skin \nthough there is no comfort in it. Because he knows he can never be warm and \ndry again. The wall is too high. \nBut still he keeps walking, keeps crying out, though quieter now. Nobody \nknows he’s here, and even if they did, they wouldn’t care. He has driven them \nall away, kept them so far from who he is that there is no-one now to see his \nsuffering. No-one who cares. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 186 – Quiet \n \n24 \nHe falls to his knees, icy mud clinging to his legs, soaking through his \nthreadbare trousers as tears and rain fall from his cheeks in equal measure. \nNext to him, a woman lies on her side, curled tight around herself, head tucked \nto her chest. He does not see her, cannot hear her wracking sobs, so close to \nhis. She could reach out her hand, touch his arm, his face, his heart... and \nwould feel nothing. Neither would ever know. Because at their core they are \nalone, and nothing can release them from that absolute knowledge. \nShe stands, legs shaking from the cold and from the effort, her muscles locked \nin place, and joints protesting at the shift. How long has she been lying there? \nHow long have the fingers of despair locked around her throat? She doesn’t \nknow, and she feels in her bones that no one else does either. Nobody knows \nshe’s here, and she misses them all. \nShe tries to picture her friends. A warm and smiling procession of faces, a \ntechnicolour memory that only makes the iron-grey sky that much duller, the \nmisty drizzle that much colder on her face. What is she recalling? There was \nmusic once, lights, laughter— a-a birthday, maybe, or a pub lunch? They sat \naround on old chairs, comfortable chairs in the warm. The taste of wine was on \nher tongue, and her mouth was curled into a smile. The carefree chatter of her \nfriends surrounded her and soothed her. Or did it? \nShe wasn’t talking, wasn’t engaged with any of the bright and happy people. \nHer smile was fixed and deliberate, and it didn’t quite match her eyes. She was \namong this joy, yes, these sparkling friends, but she was not a part of it, not \nreally. She tried to be, wanted so desperately to be a part of their easy \nwarmth, and maybe they thought she was. But they hadn’t known her, not \nreally.
