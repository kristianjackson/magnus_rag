Not much, I’d bet. Maybe \nyou’ve seen a few prison movies, think you know a bit about how it is in there. \nYou’ve got to keep face and watch your back, right? After all, you never know \nwho’s got a shiv with your name on it. Well, for a start, you’re probably \nthinking of American movies about American prisons and I can’t speak to that. \nMaybe it is non-stop gang warfare over there, but in my experience the biggest \ndanger in a prison is, and always will be, boredom. I say that like it’s some glib \nobservation, but we work hard to keep it as boring as possible. The first hint of \nviolence among the inmates gets smacked down. \nI worked as a prison officer in Her Majesty’s Prison Wakefield, or ‘The Monster \nMansion’ as the press insists on calling it. It houses the real scum of this \ncountry, class A dangers the lot of them, and it was always a point of pride to \nme that we kept that place quiet. I mean, I say it like I had any real power, but I \nwas just a grunt, keeping an eye on a cage full of wild animals. I won’t even \npretend I was proportional in my use of force. I mean, prison inspectorate have \nbeen over that with me already, but the sort of things you have to have done \nto end up in Wakefield... Well, let’s just say the suicide attempts far \noutnumbered the murder attempts and I never lost any sleep over that fact. \nNor did any of the inmates. I made sure of that. \nAfter lock-up at 7pm sharp, I made a point of keeping my wing dark and quiet. \nIt helped that they were single cells, of course. No worries about conversation \nor violence between cellmates, but even then I was careful to make it very \nclear that drawing my attention after lights-out was something they would \nregret. I’ll admit, I was a real bastard when I worked there. Sometimes you \nneed a bastard to keep an eye on the monsters. And back then I really thought", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 0, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 2901}}
