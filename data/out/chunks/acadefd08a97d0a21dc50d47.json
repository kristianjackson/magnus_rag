It’s \nfunny how fear can just become as routine as hunger – at a certain point I just \naccepted it. \nMy first clue that my time keeping the coffin was coming to an end was when \nit began to rain and there was silence. I didn’t notice at first, as my habit at \nthat point had been to put on the music as soon as the weather began to turn, \nbut after a few minutes I realised that there wasn’t anything to drown out. I \nturned off my music and went to check. The living room was silent. Then came \na knock at the door. The sound was light and unobtrusive but it rang out like \nthunder in the quiet flat. I knew what I’d see as soon as I opened the door and I \nwas right. John and the two delivery men stood there. I wasn’t surprised to see \nthem, as I say, but they actually seemed quite surprised to see me. John had to \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG002 – Do Not Open \n11 \n \ntake a second to look me up and down, almost in disbelief, as I asked if they’d \ncome to collect their coffin. He said that they had, and he hoped it hadn’t been \ntoo much trouble. I told him where he could stick it and he didn’t seem to have \nan answer for that. He did seem genuinely impressed, however, when I got the \nkey out of the freezer. I didn’t even try to thaw it – I was so eager to have this \nthing out of my life that I just dropped the bowl of ice on the floor and \nshattered it. I watched as John picked the icy key off the floor and I told them it \nwas in the living room. I didn’t follow them. I didn’t want to see what they did \nwith the coffin. I didn’t want to see if they opened it. And when the screaming \nstarted, I didn’t want to see who was screaming or why. I only left the kitchen \nwhen the two delivery men carried the coffin past the door. I followed them \ndown the stairs, and watched in the pouring rain as they locked it into a small \nvan marked “Breekon and Hope deliveries”. Then they drove away. There was \nno sign of John. That was the last I heard of it. I got a new job and moved to \nLondon shortly afterwards, and now I just try not to think about it too much. \nJONATHAN SIMS \nStatement ends. \nIt’s always nice to hear that my hometown is not entirely devoid of odd \noccurrences and eerie stories. Ice cream, beaches and boredom are all very \nwell, but I’m glad to hear Bournemouth has at least a few apparitions to call its \nown. That said, the fact is Mr Gillespie’s statement starts with drug use and \ncontinues on with the lack of corroborating witnesses being a central theme, \nwhich means that an eerie story is all that it is. When the Institute first \ninvestigated, it doesn’t look like they were able to find a single piece of \nevidence to support the existence of this scratched coffin, and to be honest I", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 7, "chunk_count": 9, "chars": 2755}}
