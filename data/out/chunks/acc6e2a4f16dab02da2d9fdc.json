How \ndo you tell your wife something like that happened to you? \nWe took the first coach the following morning and haven’t stopped. I didn’t \neven realise the coin was missing until I checked my luggage later. Whether to \na light-fingered servant or just my own carelessness, it is gone, so I must \napologise that I will not be able to share that particular piece of history with \nyou. I must also apologise for the handwriting; I have been committing this to \npaper as well as can be done on a long coach-journey. Still, I look forward to \nshowing you the book I have acquired, and the revelations you will no doubt \nglean from it. \nYours in trust, Albrecht \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nStatement ends. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG023 – Schwartzwald \n15 \n \nAlways a treat to find a piece of history tucked into the wrong section of the \narchive. Still, I can’t say I know much about Jonah Magnus or the origins of the \nInstitute, so this is a rather pleasing discovery in some ways. Obviously there \nisn’t much follow-up to be done here, but to slake my own interest I have done \na little bit of digging myself, which I include here for completeness sake \nI’ve only found one reference to any ‘Johann von Württemberg’ in any of the \nGerman history reference material we have available. Jan Moira’s Cradle of \nGermany – Württemberg through the Centuries mentions rumours that Ulrich \nI, Count of Württemberg had a second son out of wedlock in 1255. No name is \nlisted, but certain enemies of the count were known to spread rumours that \nthis exiled son was “keeping the company of witches”. 1279 was also the year \nthat Ulrich I’s successor, Ulrich II, died. This may simply have been coincidence, \nhowever, as he was succeeded by his half-brother Eberhard I. \nSomething else I stumbled across quite by accident during my research was in \nGrim Tales, H.T. Moncreef’s exploration of unexplained and macabre deaths in \nearly 19th century Europe. It mentions a death that took place in Schramberg \nin 1816. The man, one Rudolph Ziegler, was found dead at his home on the \noutskirts of town. What is interesting is that it says he worked in service on an \nestate nearby. Shortly after his death, one Wilhelm von Closen was \ninvestigated for the crime, as it was discovered the dead man had been \nstealing jewellery from the estate. It was eventually dropped however, after \nfour doctors attested that the ferocity of the wounds inflicted on Herr Ziegler \nwere, and I quote, “beyond the capability of human violence”. It was ruled an \nanimal attack. \nI did try to find out what happened to Albrecht von Closen and his book, but I \ncan find no mention of him in any volume of history nor anywhere online. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG023 – Schwartzwald \n16 \n \nPerhaps I might find out more if I spent months sifting through the historical \nstatements in the Archives’ back rooms, but I simply don’t have time to indulge \nmy own curiosity like that. \nI have located a genealogy for Wilhelm von Closen, though. He married and \nhad children, and the family remained located in and around Schramberg for \nalmost another century, before one branch emigrated to England in 1908. They \nhad a daughter, Elsa, who went on to marry a man by the name of Michael \nKeay in 1920. In 1924, they had one daughter, whose name was Mary Keay. \nThis may be simple coincidence, but... it concerns me. \nEnd recording. \n[The Magnus Archives Theme - Outro] \n \nThe Magnus Archives is a podcast distributed by Rusty Quill and licensed under \na creative commons attribution, non-commercial share alike 4.0 international \nlicense.
