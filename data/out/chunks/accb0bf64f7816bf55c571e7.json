At the age of 63, everyone is \nsurprised and saddened, but not shocked. I try to tell myself it’s a coincidence, \nthat a heart attack is the most natural death in the world, but at the funeral, \ndespite arranging it myself, despite selecting the burial plot and the headstone, \nI watch as they take my father off for cremation. And nobody can tell me why. \nThey simply say how sorry they are for my loss and hand me my father’s ashes. \nI don’t want his ashes. \n \nI know he’ll be back, the policeman with three bright pips on his shoulder, and \nhe’ll ask me what else I love. And I’ll tell him. Then he’ll ask me who he is, and I \nwon’t say. I don’t want to cause any panic. \n \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG107 – Third Degree \n \n10 \n \nStatement ends. \n \n(Archivist exhales) \n \nI’m going to bed. \n \n(Click) \n \n(Click) \n \nARCHIVIST \nI feel... a lot better. I’d love to rattle off a list of potential other reasons for this, \nnice rational causes of recovery, but I think we’re past the point of transparent \nrationalisations. It looks like the recording of statements has now passed over \nfrom psychological compulsion into a more physical dependence. I don’t know \nwhether this is some sort of classical addiction or something a bit deeper, but \neither way this is not the time for experimentation. I am on a deadline and if I \nneed to be reading statements to stay well enough, then I suppose that’s what \nI shall do. What irritates me most is that Elias was clearly aware of this, hence \nhis sending me this, which seems to me to serve no other purpose but as a \nrestorative. But, as usual, he chose to keep this very useful information to \nhimself. \n \nI think I’ve reached another dead end here. I’ve decided it’s the last one. The \nInstitute needs me there, not jetting around the world following a cold trail \nthat may very well not have led to anything useful the first time. I’ve a \nGreyhound booked down to Washington DC tomorrow. I’m going to stop in at \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG107 – Third Degree \n \n11 \n \nthe Usher Foundation, just in case they have anything that might help, then I’m \nflying home. \n \n(Click) \n \n(Click) \n \n(Sounds of busy roadside diner) \n \nARCHIVIST \n(Quietly) I’m at a rest stop. The bus has— they’re giving us a comfort break. \nBut there’s a woman here, in the café, the diner, whatever. I’ve seen her car. I \nthink she’s following the bus. She’s early 30s, I think, dressed... nondescript: \nhard-wearing denim, old leather... She is definitely watching me. She doesn’t \nlook like a—she’s coming over, I thi— Hello! C-can I help you? \n \nJULIA \n(Casual) Sure. Whatever you’re reaching for, don’t. \n \nARCHIVIST \nUh, what? \n \nJULIA \nKeep your hands on the table and we can all walk away from this. \n \nARCHIVIST \nYou’re English? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG107 – Third Degree \n \n12 \n \n \nJULIA \nSo are you. Ah-ah! Hands on the table. \n \nARCHIVIST \nWho are you? \n \nJULIA \nJulia. Who are you? \n \nARCHIVIST \nI— Uh, you don’t... know me? \n \nJULIA \nShould I? \n \nARCHIVIST \nN-no, I guess. Just... everyone normally seems to. \n \nJULIA \nHm. Good for you. \n \nARCHIVIST \nNot really. \n \nJULIA \nSo, who are you? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG107 – Third Degree \n \n13 \n \n \nARCHIVIST \nOh, uh... Jonathan. John Sims. I, I’m the head archivist for the Magnus \nInstitute, London. \n \nJULIA \n(Pause) Huh. You don’t say. So, what brings you down the I-70, Pennsylvania. \n \nARCHIVIST \nLook, I mean, you’re the one following me. \n \nJULIA \nYup. Told you were asking some interesting questions around a few places \nback in Pittsburgh. And you seem to have attracted the attention of something \nwe’ve been watching for a while. \n \nARCHIVIST \nUh, my bus is leaving. \n \nJULIA \nLet it. You’re riding with me. \n \nARCHIVIST \nI don’t think so. \n \nJULIA \nThen try to run. Go on. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG107 – Third Degree \n \n14 \n \n \nARCHIVIST \nSo... Kidnapped. Again. \n \nJULIA \nThink of it like an... escort. Personal bodyguard. You’re heading to DC, right? \nCome on. We can chat in the car. I’m sure you’ve got a ton of librarian stories – \nthe miles’ll just fly past. \n \nARCHIVIST \nDo I have any choice? \n \nJULIA \nIf you did, you’d only make a mistake. Come on. \n \n(Click) \n \n(Click) \n \n(Rumble of engines, driving down the interstate) \n \nARCHIVIST \nAre you alright? You seem, uh... \n \nJULIA \nSure, just keeping an eye out.
