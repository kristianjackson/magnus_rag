You barely met her — you had half an hour \ntogether, and she spent most of that time ranting about mazes! She was \npositively delirious with paranoia! \nARCHIVIST \nTrue. But as you’ll recall, I was pretty paranoid myself at that point. \nHELEN \nSo what? You saw yourself in her? A sad reflection? A possible future? \nARCHIVIST \nMaybe. \nHELEN \nOh John! This existence can be wonderful, if you just let it. \nARCHIVIST \n(Sadly) I know. \n[He continues to walk] \nHELEN \nFor what it’s worth, I really don't think you would have liked her, if you’d \nknown her better, I mean. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 187 – Checking Out \n \n12 \nARCHIVIST \nNo? \nHELEN \nYou haven’t looked into Helen-Classic’s past yet? You should try it. I don’t think \nyou’ll like what you find. \nARCHIVIST \nWhat? Lying to real estate clients? Bit of a prick at parties? Secret Tory? \nHELEN \nYes. \nTo all of them, actually. \nARCHIVIST \nAnd that’s the problem. \n[The Archivist pauses walking] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nI could have grown to dislike her, but… you made sure that sort of thing could \nnever happen. Now you use her form, see her mind, but they’re just… tools. \nMichael had nothing you could use but a razor-straight desire for vengeance, \nbut you saw something in Helen that would work on me much more subtly. So \nyou took her. And I’ll never get to dislike her. \nI’m stuck disliking you instead. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 187 – Checking Out \n \n13 \nHELEN \nAt least I care enough to bother. \nARCHIVIST \nThat’s true I suppose. \n[The Archivist restarts walking] \n[Hissing static starts] \nHELEN \nOh. Blergh. Please stop doing that. \nARCHIVIST \nI’ll stop doing it when I’m confident you’re taking me the right way. \nHELEN \nI am! \nARCHIVIST \nThe quickest way. \n[Hissing static ends] \nHELEN \nEurgh. Fine. \n[The Archivist halts as the corridors shift in crunching wood, metal \nand brick] \n[A door creaks open; the Archivist restarts walking] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 187 – Checking Out \n \n14 \n[Hissing static starts] \nARCHIVIST \nSo tell me. Why are we going the long way? You just trying to keep me from \nmeeting any victims? \n[Hissing static ends] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nOr are you trying to figure out if there’s still a way you can destroy me? \nHELEN \n…Bit of both, to be honest. \nARCHIVIST \nI see. How long have you been working with Elias? \nHELEN \nI’m not. \n[The Archivist pauses walking] \nARCHIVIST \n(Faux-shocked) Helen! Is that... a lie? \nHELEN \nNo. No! It’s not. I don’t know him. I’ve never even— Look, I’m happy here \nalright? The world is fabulous, and I don’t want you to end it all because you’ve \ngot a chip on your shoulder. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 187 – Checking Out \n \n15 \nARCHIVIST \nSo you think I can turn the world back? \nHELEN \nI think you’re bloody minded and stubborn, and I won’t underestimate you. \n[The Archivist restarts walking] \nARCHIVIST \nThank you. \nHELEN \nAnd for all his bleeding heart, Martin’s just as bad. Worse, even, in some ways. \nARCHIVIST \n(Fondly) Yes, he is. \n(Beat) \nHELEN \nYou are so difficult to like sometimes. I’ve been nothing but nice to you. \nARCHIVIST \nMaybe that’s why I never trusted you. \nHELEN \nSee? So rude. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 187 – Checking Out \n \n16 \nARCHIVIST \nOr maybe it’s because you’re an embodiment of the fear of lies and delusion. \nHELEN \nAlso rude. \n(The Archivist makes a small noise of discomfort) \n[The Archivist pauses walking] \nARCHIVIST \nCould you, uh… sorry, could you manifest a room for me? Please. \nHELEN \nWhy? \nARCHIVIST \n…So I can make a statement. \nHELEN \nYou do realise it’s all me, right? If I make a room, I’ll still hear you. Because I’d \nbe the room? \nARCHIVIST \nFine, I just thought— never mind. \n[Hissing static starts] \n(Deep breath)", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 2, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 3831}}
