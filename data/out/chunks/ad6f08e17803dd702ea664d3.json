Well, well, I was, but it was \na break-in about ten miles further on, and I just wasn’t in a hurry. I mean, \nLanncraig is the sort of place you don’t even notice you’ve been through if \nyou’re not looking – a half mile of road with a handful of white or stone \ncottages dotting the fields, nothing you’d recognise as a shop, and it’s two \nmiles the other way to the post office. Lanncraig is what they write on the \nmap, but to most people it’s just more empty Highland. It’s like that with a lot \nof old crofting communities. They’ve all got their little parcel of land for \nfarming, and a big old stretch to keep the sheep all together, but it’s a poor \nlife, really, and hard work. Lends itself to isolation well. Too well, sometimes. \nI knew Callum McKenzie, or at the very least he knew me. Again, not well, but \nNorth Highlands Police tend to serve a lot of very small communities, and I \nstood out like a sore thumb. He called me “the bastard English”, but he always \ndid it with a smile on his face. His little house served as pub for those minded \nto use it. He didn’t have a licence, but if the landlord didn’t mind, who was \ngoing to raise a stink about it? I could have, I guess, but it would’ve been a \ndamn stupid thing to do, turning them all against me. He even showed me the \nstill he kept out back once, and I’m very thankful I was on duty at the time, or I \nmight have had to drink some out of politeness. \nSo, I’m driving, heading towards this break-in over in Dalnessie, when \nConstable Carla Ross, my partner, starts telling me to slow down. Now, Ross \nhad known Callum a lot longer than I had, being about ten years my senior on \nthe force, and had a good twenty years’ experience policing these \ncommunities. I dropped speed, and she stared out at one of the crofts next to \nus, making this little noise of uncertainty. I was just about to speed up again \nwhen she gasped and yelled to stop the car.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 0, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 2737}}
