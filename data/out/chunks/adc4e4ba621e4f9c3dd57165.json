Goodness can \nyou imagine the coincidence if there were two of us. Hah! Hardly bears \nthinking about. But no, I’m the only one here. Fact of the matter is, I’m the \nonly doctor on staff. Most days it’s just me and the orderlies. No-one else \naround for miles. \n[Creak and fabric movements from a bed] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nYou’re sure? Well, that is very strange. Would you mind describing this ‘other’ \nDoctor David. \n[Creak and fabric movements from a bed] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nMmhm? Mmhm? Oh, did he now? Well isn’t that fascinating. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 177 – Wonderland \n26 \nRight, well, I think I’m starting to see what might be going on here and, let me \nassure you, it isn’t going to work. \n[Short creak and fabric movements from a bed] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nOh, I know, I know, I know. It’s just that we have no patience here for your \nridiculous lies. Seeing things? Phantom doctors? You really think I’m that much \nof an idiot? You concoct some half-baked little hallucination, and suddenly I’m \nstamping ‘crazy’ on your forehead? I’m dreadfully sorry to disappoint you, but \nthat’s not how things work here. \n[Creak and fabric movements from a bed] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nOh, other doctors did, did they? Mm. Well, that sounds reasonable, let me just \nhave a look at your case file here, a gander at the old medical history. \n[Sounds of a hospital clipboard being picked up and pages flicked \nthrough] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nMedication, diagnosis, medication, oooh, hospitalisation. Hm. \n[Clipboard placed down] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nTrouble is it’s all lies, isn’t it? Because I’m your doctor now, Doctor David, and I \nsay these people, these ‘professionals’, had no idea what they’re talking about \nbecause, well, I understand what they simply didn’t. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 177 – Wonderland \n27 \nYou made it all up, didn’t you? \n[Creak and fabric movements from a bed] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nWhat was it? A plea for attention, trying so desperately to make the world \nnotice you? Some childish attempt to feel special? Or were you just looking for \nan excuse for the fact that you’re a lazy, unlikeable waste of air? \n[Creak and fabric movements from a bed] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \n‘Paranoia’, hm, it’s big word, isn’t it? A big excuse. Because here’s the \ninteresting thing: you are completely sane and rational. Everyone legitimately \ndoes hate you. \n[Creak and fabric movements from a bed] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nIt’s not your brain making up lies, don’t be stupid. No, you’re just a horribly \nunpleasant person to be around. You make people uncomfortable. You never \nsay the right thing. You somehow always manage to smell bad. \nNo wonder people talk about you behind your back. Even I hate you, and I’m \nresponsible for your treatment. Isn’t that funny? \n(Mirthless chuckle) \n[Creak and fabric movements from a bed] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 177 – Wonderland \n28 \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nHm? Oh, I’m sure you would like some medication. Yes, I’m sure you would. \nThat chemical safety blanket whispering to you ‘Oh don’t worry you’re just \nmad. You don’t need to take responsibility for anything.’ You’ll get none of that \nnonsense here. No. We’ll teach you to stand on your own two feet. And we \nhave all the time in the world to do so. \n[Creak and fabric movements from a bed] \n[The doctor walks to the door and opens it; the hospital sounds \nseem distorted and there is a distant screaming multitude] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nGood night. \n[Door closes and all SFX stop for a beat] \n[The door opens and closes with a heavy latch sound of a church \ndoor; the hospital and screaming multitude are heard again] \n[A clock ticks louder] \n[Footsteps as the doctor arrives] \n[After the door closes, the distant sound of screams can still be \nheard alongside a clownish laugh] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nAh, good morning. How are we feeling today? \n[Short creak and fabric movements from a bed]", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 5, "chunk_count": 10, "chars": 4057}}
