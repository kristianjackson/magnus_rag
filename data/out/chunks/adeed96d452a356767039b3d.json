It always brought up by my \nemployers as ‘evidence of my thoroughness’, and I took a lot of pride in it. \nBut in my hurry to be finished and out of Hill Top Road, I hadn’t even checked \nit. I looked at the small door, then back to my half-zipped bag, and… I decided \nto just take a quick look. Just a quick look. It was a new house. How dirty could \nit be? \nObviously it was my decision. I remember the little handle was warm. I don’t \nknow if that’s just my memory playing tricks on me, but I do remember that. It \nopened to reveal stairs going down into a basement. Nobody had mentioned a \nbasement. Not when they gave me the job, not on the floor plan they’d given \n\nme; I’d had absolutely no idea it was there. I found my legs were shaking as my \nbrain pushed forward one question over and over: do they expect me to clean \ndown there? \nI decided, again, just to have a look. Just a quick look. See if there was anything \ndown there that did need my attention. Maybe it was already spotless, or \nmaybe it hadn’t been tanked, and was still just bare brick and stone, too raw \nfor me to do anything with anyway. I just had to check. \nIt was warmer down there, warmer every step, and I found myself brushing \ncobwebs from my face as I got further down, until at last there I was – stood in \nthe cellar of Hill Top Road. There was just a very quick second of relief, of \nletting my breath out. I saw how damp it was, full of unfinished brickwork, \ndefinitely not something any estate agent would expect me to clean. And then \nI noticed the crack. \nIt seemed to split the floor right down the middle; it was jagged, vicious, like \nsomething had torn out the ground with a hook. It was maybe a foot across at \nits widest, and so dark inside it made my teeth ache. I’m not sure how I saw it. \nThinking now I know that there wasn’t any light down there, but… that horrid \ngap was clear as day, darker than just the simple lack of light that surrounded \nit. And then I was at the edge looking down, and those eight spindly arms \nreaching up to pull me in. I couldn’t have screamed even if I wanted to. \nI woke up in one of the chairs, the dust cover clinging to me like a cocoon. I \nthrew it off, and ran out of that house, and I haven’t been back. But now… \neverything’s wrong. I went to clean that house on April the 23rd 2009 which, \naccording to all of you, is tomorrow. But it can’t be. \n\nThat was two weeks ago. I’ve tried to talk to my friends about it. Those of my \nfriends I can find, but they seem distant, like they don’t really know me. \nEverything is just… wrong. I can’t find my favourite coffee shop. And I don’t \nknow who you people are. \nARCHIVIST \nStatement ends. \nInteresting. I’m not really sure what to do with this one. Martin brought it up, \nsaid he’d found one that related back to Hill Top Road, a thread that’s been \nnagging at me for a while, but... I mean, it seems straightforward enough, \nexcept… that it never happened. As far as I can tell, Anya Villette doesn’t exist. \nJohn Hector Lettings does seem to be a real estate agents in Oxford, but \naccording to our enquiries they’ve never employed anyone by that name to \nwork as a cleaner, nor are they currently responsible for the infamous house. \nBasira found a couple of possibilities online that might have been her, but the \ntwo that almost matched, both professed complete ignorance to any of this. As \nfar as we can tell, the house has no estate agent looking after it, and no \ncurrent owner. Certainly no plans to lease it students. I’ve half a mind to just \ngo down and have a look at it myself, but… I don’t know. Ever since it first \ncame up I’ve felt like it would be… just a very bad idea. We’ve been trying to \nget a closer look at the documents, figure out who technically owns the place, \nbut… it’s been over year, and we’re still waiting. Haven’t really had the time to \nfoll— \n[There’s a noise – Tim is entering the room from the tunnels.] \nAh… \n\n(The Archivist takes a deep breath.) \n[The sound of something wooden being moved – a trap door, or covering \nperhaps.] \nARCHIVIST \nHello Tim. \nTIM \nOh god… \nARCHIVIST \nCome in, please. \nTIM \n(False politeness) Good to see you, Boss. How’ve you been? \nARCHIVIST \nI’m not going to lie to you, Tim. It’s been a difficult few months. \nTIM \n(Deadpan) Good. \nARCHIVIST \nAnd h— I would like to hear how you’ve been doing. \nTIM \nMe? Oh, I’ve been just fine. I’ll see you later.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 2, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 4455}}
