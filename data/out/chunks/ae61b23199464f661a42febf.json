You won! I am sorry if it doesn’t look quite like you \nhoped, but here we are. \n \nMARTIN \nI suppose so. So what now? \n \nPETER \nWell, if you could send Melanie and Basira up to see me, I’d like to introduce \nmyself. After that, I’ll put through a couple of weeks of paid leave for you all. I \nthink giving everyone some space to try and deal with the loss of Tim and Daisy \nmight do everyone some good.

And don’t look so down. I know change can be scary, but \neventually it happens just the same.
