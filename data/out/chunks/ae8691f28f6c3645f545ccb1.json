And to my great relief, it wasn’t. Again I found myself \npresent over my own body, a severed presence watching as the water continued \nto beat down on my unmoving form. I was starting to develop a suspicion, a \nvague idea of what might be going on. There was no one else around. Daven was \non a business trip and I was alone in the house. I tried to move and I could. It \nalmost felt like walking though I had no legs to carry me. Unable to touch the \nbathroom door, I simply moved through it, then out into the world, looking for \nsomething I couldn’t quite name. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 155 – Cost of Living \n11 \n \nPerhaps that doctor had not been an accident. Perhaps his death and my life had \nbeen one and the same. Did I have to do it again? The idea appalled me to my \ncore, but it seemed the only explanation. I had to live, I couldn’t die, not then. We \nwere on the verge of closing a deal that would provide fresh water to \nimpoverished communities in a dozen developing countries. Without me, it would \nfall through. So I kept moving, senses attuned to what I needed, and I found her \nsitting in a park all on her own. An old woman, frail and shivering, staring out of \nthe ducks over the water, empty bread bag by her side. If only I could have \nexplained it to her, I’m sure she would have understood. She might even have \nagreed. But I couldn’t talk to her, and I needed to live. She was found dead of a \nstroke, and I woke up in my shower with a splitting headache. \nI thought I’d solved it. If anything else like that happened, I knew what I needed to \ndo. But when I began to have a fatal allergic reaction during a lunch date only two \nweeks later, despite having no allergies previously, I realized I had miscalculated. \nPerhaps it was life itself that I was taking, and the old woman that had hardly any \nleft in her, and it had run out too fast. This time I sought out a homeless man. \nYoung and strong, though his life was clearly over as he tried to destroy himself \nthrough drinking. I followed him into an alley, and his liver gave out, just at the \nmoment the EpiPen was pushed into my leg. But even that seemed to run out \nfaster than it should have. The car accident was only three months later, and I \neven found myself resenting the poor vagrant for not having more life to sustain \nme. \nI made a decision. One I am deeply ashamed of, but I honestly thought it was for \nthe best. I couldn’t keep living like that in the shadow of death, of what I had to \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 155 – Cost of Living \n12 \n \ndo to keep going. One sacrifice, I thought. Just one, from someone with their \nentire life ahead of them. I took a newborn. It’s strange, the maths you do of it all. \nA full life ahead of it, but aside from the devastated parents, no real harm to the \nworld as a whole. No good works left unfinished. It was a baby born to poverty, \none whose life I thought would bring it pain, and I believed it would be the last I \nwould ever need to do. Surely this would be enough, surely it would see me \nthrough to the time I was actually meant to die. That I could go peacefully into \noblivion, not trapped in that dreadful darkness. But it kept me alive for 10 \nmonths, still less than the doctor. Eventually I realized it had nothing to do with \nage or health. It was about connection. About joy. The more friends, family, loved \nones the person has, the further out the terror of sudden death spreads from me. \nThe longer it keeps me alive. \nI’m 40 now, and I have taken the life of beloved mothers, respected professionals, \npillars of the community. But I have done so much good with my life, I’ve reached \nfurther helped more people than they ever could have. Since this became my \nexistence I’ve thrown myself into philanthropy harder than ever, and the world is \nso much better for me being in it. I’m not saying how I live is right, or good, but it \nis the position I have been put in, and a decision I have to make. I never wanted to \nweigh up the value of a life, to set it on the scales against my own, but that’s a \nchoice that I am forced into. And it is one I will continue to make. \nARCHIVIST \nStatement ends.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 3, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 4286}}
