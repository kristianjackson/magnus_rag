I’ll do what I can. When do you need it? \nGERTRUDE \nIf my guess is right, the Church’s ritual should be collapsing any time now, so— \nimmediately. \nJURGEN \nAnd if you’re wrong? \nGERTRUDE \nThen a bit of gas will be the least of our worries. \nJURGEN \n...Right. What are you going to do? \nGERTRUDE \nPaper burns well. \n[She holds up a container of sloshing liquid] \nGERTRUDE (CONT’D) \nPetrol burns better. \n(Leitner laughs) \n[The container sloshes again as Gertrude sets it down] \nJURGEN \nI always forget your pyromaniac streak. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 161 – Dwelling \n28 \nGERTRUDE \nMm. Remind me to tell you about Agnes sometime. \nJURGEN \nRight. \n(Beat) \nDid you mean to leave the tape running? \nGERTRUDE \nOh, good grief. Forty years I’ve been using them, and I swear, I’ll nev- \n[Tape click] \n[The sound of strange and distant howls and wood creaks resume] \n \nARCHIVIST \nCan you imagine? If we’d had this? \nMARTIN \nBut we didn’t though, did we. \nARCHIVIST \nNo— \nMARTIN \nSo there’s no point in dwelling. \n(Heavy breath from the Archivist) \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 161 – Dwelling \n29 \nMARTIN (CONT’D) \nJohn, I- This isn’t healthy. \nARCHIVIST \nHealthy? I am an Avatar of voyeuristic terror, who unquestioned craving for \nknowledge has condemned the entire world to an eternity of torment; healthy \ni-isn’t- i,it’s not- \nMARTIN \nFine, fine. I get it. \nARCHIVIST \nBesides. G— (shaky) Grief... is healthy. I,if nothing else, it pushes away the \nother feelings that that— thing wants me to experience. \nMARTIN \nIt just— It hurts me to see you wallowing like this. \nARCHIVIST \n(Snapping) Well, some of us weren’t able to cut ourselves off from the world \nbefore it ended. \nMARTIN \nThat’s not fair. \n(Beat) \nARCHIVIST \nNo, it’s not; I’m- I’m sorry, I just— (large shaky breath) It hurts. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 161 – Dwelling \n30 \nMARTIN \nI know. \nARCHIVIST \nI need time. \nMARTIN \nI know. But we can’t stay in this cabin forever. \nARCHIVIST \nWhy not? It- It’s quiet, here, and I have you. \n(Martin half laughs, half exasperatedly sighs) \nMARTIN \nWhat about food? \nARCHIVIST \nWhat about it? When’s the last time you thought to eat, or even felt hungry? \nMARTIN \n(Quiet) Wh— What? (Louder, a revelation) Uh- I don’t know. \nARCHIVIST \nNo. Whatever is sustaining us now doesn’t need us to eat. \nMARTIN \nThat- That can’t be possible. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 161 – Dwelling \n31 \nARCHIVIST \nIt’s a new world, Martin; the natural laws are whatever they want them to be. \nAnd I suspect they don’t much care to keep humanity fed and watered. \nMARTIN \nWell, that as may be, we can’t just stay here forever. \nARCHIVIST \nWhat could possibly be out there that you want to see? \nMARTIN \nA way to stop this, a way to turn the world back! \nARCHIVIST \nDo you really think there is one? \nMARTIN \nWell, if there is, it’s not in here, is it? \nARCHIVIST \nIt’s so- (shaky breath) It’s so.. loud, out there? The agony, the, the terror, I can \nsee it all so much more clearly. \nMARTIN \nI’m sorry. \nARCHIVIST \nNo, it’s- I love you, I just— I need more time. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 161 – Dwelling \n32 \n(Beat) \nMARTIN \nIt’s alright. \n(Beat) \nIt’s alright; I’m good at waiting. \nARCHIVIST \n(Near whisper) Thank you. \n(Beat) \nI just wish it didn’t feel like whatever’s out there was waiting, too. \nMARTIN \n..Yeah. \n(Beat) \n[Clothes rustling] \nMARTIN (CONT’D) \nHey- Hey, when did you start recording? \nARCHIVIST \n(Confused) I- didn’t. I only brought one, and I’ve been using it to play the \ntapes. \nMARTIN \nOh. (sigh) That’s not a great sign.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 5, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 3695}}
