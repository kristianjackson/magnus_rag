Can you imagine \nhow much I’d hate having to watch you fumble around as my replacement. I \nreally cannot express how much of a disappointment you are. \n \nARCHIVIST \nI, I’m sorry. I, I didn’t even— \n \nGERTRUDE (NIKOLA) \nI fought for years to stop the Stranger in its tracks, and you didn’t even notice \nwhen they desecrated my corpse. And now look at me. You’ve made me part \nof their ritual. This is your fault. \n \nARCHIVIST \nIt is not. I didn’t know... It’s not my fault you died. \n \nLEITNER (NIKOLA) \nNo, I suppose not. Me, on the other hand... That one is very much your fault. \n \nARCHIVIST \nNo, not... Not you as well. \n \nLEITNER (NIKOLA) \nOh yes. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG119 – Stranger and Stranger \n \n16 \n \n \nARCHIVIST \nYou told me... Why, why didn’t you warn me it would be like this? \n \nLEITNER (NIKOLA) \nI hardly had the chance, did I, before you left me to get my head bashed in? I \nunderstand of course. You needed a cigarette. I suppose you should have \nremembered that smoking kills. [Laughs as Nicola] \n \nARCHIVIST \nThat’s not... I don’t know. \n \nLEITNER (NIKOLA) \nCome now, Archivist. Surely you still know what a cigarette is? Or a pipe? \n \nARCHIVIST \nIt’s h-hard to think. \n \nLEITNER (NIKOLA) \nIf our earlier conversation was anything to go by, I hardly think you can blame \nyour thoughtlessness on the ritual. Your problems go far deeper than that. \n \nARCHIVIST \nJust give me a moment, Jurgen, please... \n \nLEITNER (NIKOLA) \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG119 – Stranger and Stranger \n \n17 \n \nYou think that will help? Honestly, if I wasn’t so dead, I’d be impressed. I \nalways thought my own hubris to be quite exceptional, but you’ve somehow \nbeen able to fit more bad decisions into two years than I managed in a lifetime. \nBut by all means, take your moment. \n \nARCHIVIST \nWhat do you want? \n \nNIKOLA \nI already have what I want, little Archivist. Now I just want you to join me for a \ndance. \n \n(The Archivist cries out) \n \n(The music swells) \n \n(Music swell fades) \n \n(Daisy snarls) \n \nBREEKON \nYou killed him! \n \n(Breekon hits Daisy in the stomach) \n \nDo you even know what you’ve done? \n \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG119 – Stranger and Stranger \n \n18 \n \n(Breekon kicks Daisy, breaking some ribs) \n \n(Daisy begins laughing, which builds to hysteria) \n \n(Daisy leaps at Breekon, but he grabs her by the throat) \n \nBREEKON \nYou stupid animal! \n \nDAISY \n(Snarling) Kill you! \n \nBREEKON \nNo. \n \n(Breekon opens the lid to the cramped casket; it creaks eagerly. Daisy \ncontinues snarling) \n \nAlmost a shame you don’t know your own coffin. But you will. \n \n(Breekon throws Daisy inside the coffin. Daisy continues laughing as the \ncoffin lid slams shut) \n \nOh, you will. \n \n(The music swells) \n \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG119 – Stranger and Stranger \n \n19 \n \n(Musical swell fades) \n \nBASIRA \nDon’t panic. Don’t panic. Just close your, uh... Ignore it. Ignore the, uh... Don’t \nlisten. Focus. Think. This is a place. You are you and you are in a place now. If... \nif it’s a place and it’s a now then... then it... then it has an end. The other \nthings, the... they are... too much, too much. There’s too many and they want \nto hurt me, so... So you leave the place, leave the place and the now. No place \nis forever. You know how to move, so do it. Pick a where, then... then move. \nGood! Then... then keep moving. Keep moving until you find another place, a \nplace you know. Just keep moving... keep moving. \n \n(The music swells) \n \n(Musical swell fades) \n \n(The Archivist staggers from the dance, exhausted) \n \nNIKOLA \nDo you feel it, Archivist? It’s almost there. A new day... \n \nGERTRUDE (NIKOLA) \nA terrible new world. And it’s all your fault. \n \nLEITNER (NIKOLA) \nThough I suppose you never really had a chance.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 2, "chunk_count": 5, "chars": 3777}}
