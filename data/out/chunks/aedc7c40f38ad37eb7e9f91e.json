There are \nother accounts, however, that claim the scholars barricaded themselves inside \nwith prisoners and retreated to hidden caverns deep below. Some even go so \nfar as to claim the captives were tortured into the worship of pagan deities or \noffered as blood sacrifices. There’s even one unnamed contemporary historian \nthat describes the mob attacking the Serapeum not as Christians, but using a \nphrase which roughly translates as ‘those who sing the night’. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 053 - Crusader \n17 \n \nThe corpse found by Mr Heller would seem to be the remains of a Hospitaller \nKnight of the Order of St John, at least based on his description of the tabard, \nmost likely from the sack of Alexandria in 1365 by Peter I of Cyprus. While \ngenerally grouped in with the rest of the Crusades, it’s generally considered to \nbe one of the few such attacks with no religious motivation. Given this \ndiscovery, however, I do wonder if there might have been... other reasons. \nRegardless, I have further follow-up of my own to do. My biggest concern right \nnow is whatever creature Mr Heller encountered down there. It was 56 years \nago, but if it’s still alive, I should be careful. What was it? A guardian of some \nsort? Or perhaps... perhaps it too was once an archivist. \n[Tape clicks off. Tape clicks on.] \nARCHIVIST \nWell... only two tapes so far and already... I don’t know what to think. Another \nArchive? An earlier version? Am I just part of a chain? A long, unending string \nof people who call themselves the Archivist, stretching back to... Are we all \ndestined to end up like Gertrude? Just following the path? I need to find out \nmore about her. One thing’s becoming clear though, she did not trust the \nMagnus Institute, something that I can certainly– \n \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 053 - Crusader \n18 \n \n[The office door opens.] \nMARTIN \nI was just going down to the cafe. Did you want a sandwich? \nARCHIVIST \nThat, that depends, are you… are you going to keep hovering around me if I go \nto the canteen? \nMARTIN \nI just worry. You needed five stitches after you ‘accidentally stabbed yourself’ \nwith the bread knife. If you’re still claiming that’s what happened. \nARCHIVIST \nI am. \nMARTIN \nThen you’ll forgive me for worrying when you use sharp knives. \nARCHIVIST \n(Sigh) Fine. I’ll come with. Just give me a second to grab my coat. \nMARTIN \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 053 - Crusader \n19 \n \nSure. \n[The office door closes.] \nARCHIVIST \nMr Heller died from a stroke in 2004, making follow-up on this tape difficult, \nbut I’ve found a news article from March 1998, six months after this statement \nwas taken. It reports an explosion in Alexandria which destroyed several \nbuildings in the vicinity of Pompey’s Pillar and killed 17 people. Official \ninvestigation determined it to be a gas mains explosion, but... I wonder. \nGertrude Robinson is not who I thought she was. \nEnd supplement. \n[Tape clicks off.] \nThe Magnus Archives is a podcast distributed by Rusty Quill and licensed under \na Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Sharealike 4.0 International \nlicence. \nToday’s episode was written by Jonathan Sims and directed by Alexander J \nNewall.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 6, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 3425}}
