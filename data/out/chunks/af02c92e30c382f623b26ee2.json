He pauses for a moment, then goes to his task, hacking up the corpse, \nand loading it into the hungry flames. The smell hits him, sickening him as it \nalways does, tinged with that cloying, greasy nostalgia. \n‘I got you.’ That’s what Colin had always said to him when they were kids. And \nhe had always meant it. When Derek needed somewhere to stay when his dad \nwas on the warpath. ‘I got you.’ When Derek needed a little something to take \nthe edge off. ‘I got you.’ When the lifeless body of Derek’s father lay at the \nbottom of the stairs, limbs folded around the cricket bat he had hit him with. ‘I \ngot you.’ \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 179 – Accomplice \n \n4 \nAnd Colin was right. He had. \nWords can’t really express the gratitude Derek felt as the body disappeared \ninto the furnace of the junkyard where his friend, Colin, worked. No, friend \nwasn’t a strong enough word. They were family in that moment. And they \nwould always have each other's backs. When the police came hassling them, \nhe had Colin’s back. When some little dipshit didn’t show the proper respect, \nhe had Colin’s back. When Colin needed someone by his side for a smash and \ngrab, Derek had his back. And when one of them had to go down for three \nyears... well, it seemed only fair. \n[Metal bangs and rumbles as a cart moves away] \n[Shovelling pauses] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nThe rumble of wheels on old metal rails brings Derek back to himself as he sees \nthe now empty, bloodstained cart rolling back and away from him. \nDisappearing into the field of red-hot glowing metal. Another one would be \ncoming soon, rolling inevitably towards him. What part of his life would he \nhave to burn then. What thing he loved would he have to hurl into the flames. \nThe apprehension is as familiar to him as the scent of burning hair. He knows \nwhat it means to wait, and see what he has lost. \nThe first time he got out he had lost his job and his home. The second time he \ngot out he had lost his daughter. The third time he had lost the ability to walk \nthe streets without being hounded by some bored cop, turning out his pockets, \ndesperate for him to throw a punch. But it changed nothing. He always had \nColin’s back. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 179 – Accomplice \n \n5 \nSomething is coming. Derek can feel it. It’s not the next cart, he knows that \nsound. It’s quicker, more vicious. Panting, snarling, bloody feet speeding \nquietly over through the heat of the yard. A hatred, a deep, self-righteous \nloathing charging before him. \nIt is the sharp end of the violence that has wanted him all his life, and Derek \nhas less than a second to recognise her face before she begins to tear him \napart. \n[A launched attack with animal snarling, followed by rending \nviolence, then snatches of eating and animal grunts] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nAnother victim. Another hunt. \nThe pain and terror courses through him. \nDerek is still aware as she toys with him, pulls bits from his torso, and chews \nthem with a hundred sharpened teeth. He is aware, though not, perhaps, alive. \n[Metal bangs and rumbles as a cart moves past the scene] \n[Hissing static starts] \n[Swirling wind and distant furnace noise resumes] \n[footsteps on gravel] \nBASIRA \nShe’s here, then? \n[Hissing static ends] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 179 – Accomplice \n \n6 \nARCHIVIST \n(Surprised) Basira? I… I-I didn’t hear you, uh... \nBASIRA \nNo. I figured you wouldn’t when you were... busy. \nARCHIVIST \nI thought you were keeping watch. \nBASIRA \nI was. Watched you sneak away. \nARCHIVIST \nSorry. \nBASIRA \nYou apologise too much. \nARCHIVIST \n(Chuckling) Martin says the same thing. \nBASIRA \n(Chuckling) Like he’s any better. \n(Long beat) \nWhy didn’t you want me to hear this one? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 179 – Accomplice \n \n7 \nARCHIVIST \nWhat? \nBASIRA \nYou weren’t this cagey about the other ones, meaning you wanted to keep this \none secret. \nARCHIVIST \nUhh... Hm. \nBASIRA \nBecause this one was Daisy’s victim? \n(Beat) \nARCHIVIST \nYes. \n(Beat) \nBASIRA \nDidn’t think you knew what the statement was going to be before it \nhappened? \nARCHIVIST \nI just had a sense of it.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 1, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 4181}}
