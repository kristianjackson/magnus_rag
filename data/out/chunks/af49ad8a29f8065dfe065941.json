And I tell them to \nlook again at ‘life’, at the pain and suffering and misery that it brings with it. \nThe nature that light gives us is corrupt and base, tearing itself to pieces, \nspinning to its own sick destruction. The life that is given to us by the stars, by \nthe sun, can barely sustain itself for a century. Did you know that the oldest \nsingle thing on Earth given life by the light is the Great Basin bristlecone pine \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 135 – Dark Matter \n \n4 \n \ntree? Five thousand years some of them have been alive. Five millennia. That’s \nit. That’s all. Even the longest lived of the sun's children can barely make it a \nfew thousand years. Compare this to the uncountable eternity of darkness, \nstretching back far beyond when the sickness of an illuminated universe was \nthrown into existence. If the words of my parents hold any truth, then God is \nthe true monster, and ‘Let there be light’ the most evil words ever spoken. \nIt may come, then, as little surprise that my studies in physics drew me \ntowards dark matter and dark energy. My own theology was undeveloped back \nthen, just the smallest of thoughts, tugging from the back of my mind, a \nthought experiment I was happy to occasionally indulge. In many ways, my \nwork back then was a betrayal of my principals. For what is research and study \nif not doing the work of the light, taking what is true and hidden and rendering \nit revealed and imperfect, filtering it through a base and falsifying human mind \nas surely as the light warps the world around us. In many ways, I suppose my \nparents were right about it being unnatural, but it was my path to the truth, so \nI cannot bring myself to honestly regret it. \nDark energy, dark matter, dark radiation. The true holy trinity. Almost the \nentirety of reality is made of them, shaped by them, moved by them, and yet \nthey remain entirely impervious to the light. They resist all attempts to \nmeasure and expose them, visible only in their effect upon the world, their \nnature guessed at, seeping through the holes in our knowledge of the cosmos. \nAll of those things that are believed to be existence – matter, energy, radiation \n– all of them are utterly dwarfed by their dark counterparts. Which leads to an \ninevitable question: if the fundamental building blocks are so predominantly \nthe dark parts, is it not the light-twisted versions of them that are the \ndeviation, the pale reflection? Perhaps it should be matter and light matter.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 2, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 2746}}
