He broke a window, but \nwith his wound he did not have to strength to climb inside. In despair, he \nlooked around himself for another entrance and spied the cellar door. It was \nnot locked, and lifted with surprising ease, given how heavy the wood \nappeared. He collapsed inside, half-crawling, half-falling down the rough \nearthen steps, until he found himself lying there in the dark, dry warmth of the \nbasement. \nThe soldier lay there for some time, unmoving, eyes shut. Listening to the \ndriving New England rain beating down outside. He breathed deeply, ignoring \nthe pain from his wounded chest, and tried to gather his thoughts. What was \nimportant, he considered briefly, was that at that moment, he was not dead. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG029 – Cheating Death \n5 \n \nIt was then he caught the scent of damp. Not the damp of wet earth after a hot \nday, but the cold damp of vaults and catacombs, slick with mould and \nglimmering nitre. You would have expected Death to smell of decay, of rotting \nflesh and maggot meat, but it did not. And the soldier knew what it was \nimmediately. Even before his eyes adjusted to the dark and looked to the \ntable. Before he saw the figure that sat there in a moth-eaten monk's robe. \nThere was no reason to assume that what he saw was Death, and not simply \nsome forgotten corpse, but there was no doubt in the soldier's mind when he \ngazed upon it that he saw his doom embodied. Then it turned to look at the \nsoldier, and what little resolve remained fled from his heart. He tried to run, \nbut he got barely two steps before he collapsed again. Death waited patiently. \nTo describe it as a skeleton would be to do Death a disservice. For though the \nrobe that sat in that chair contained only bones, it was not the skeleton that \nmoved. It was Death. The bones were old, so ancient and brittle that the \nslightest pressure or movement would have rendered them down to dust. \nThey did move; Death was no more a skeleton than you are a woollen suit. \nAbove all it was old. Older than you could possibly dream. And the soldier \nbegan to weep. He cried and begged Death not to take him, but Death was \nsilent. \nNow, as long as there have been people and games, there have been tales of \nthose who gambled with Death. Some as metaphor, some as myth, but the \nsoldier had heard enough of these tales to make his own last, desperate \ngamble, and he challenged Death to a game. There was silence for several long \nminutes before it nodded its head. \nReaching into its robe, Death pulled out three things: a chess knight, a domino \nand a pair of dice, each scrimshawed out of old bone. The choice presented \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG029 – Cheating Death \n6 \n \nwas clear, but the soldier had enough wit about him to shake his head and \nreach into his pouch. He laid the cards upon the table, and asked Death if he \nknew how to play faro. Death paused, as though considering, before it nodded. \n“Very well,” it said, “and if you win, you shall not die.” \nHe replaced his totems within the mouldering robe, and pulled out instead a \nsmall hexagonal faro token, likewise made of bone. The soldier, starting to feel \nbold again as the wood of the table warped and decayed into the thirteen \ncards of a faro board, pushed it to the side and told Death, with the faintest \nhint of a smile, that he had brought his own. From somewhere, Death \nproduced a dealing box and, placing the playing cards within it, it began to \ndeal. \nFaro, or ‘Bucking the Tiger’ as the carnival hawkers would have it, is not a \ncomplicated game. Bets are placed upon the cards and the dealer draws one \ncard for the players and one for themselves. Bets matching the player’s card \nare doubled, bets matching the dealer’s cards are lost. There are a few other \nrules, of course, but if played honestly, then there is no betting game with \nfairer odds. The soldier had never before encountered an honest game. \nHe had before him a small pile of ivory sticks, not unlike those used for betting \nin mah-jongg, though the soldier had no knowledge of such a game. He knew \nthat if his pile was gone, then his life was forfeit. \nThe game was slow and deliberate, and the soldier could not have said if they \nplayed for hours, for days or for months. The night outside showed no sign of \nending, nor did the rain cease its drumming out a rhythm on the still open \ncellar door. The cards were placed slowly and deliberately by Death, and the \nsoldier became more and more amaz", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 2, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 4500}}
