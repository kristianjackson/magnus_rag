Episode one hundred and fifteen. \nTaking Stock. \n[Tape clicks on.] \nARCHIVIST \nStatement of Mikaele Salesa, regarding an antique meat grinder in his \npossession during the autumn of 1999. Original statement given January 4th \n2007. Audio recording by Jonathan Sims, Head Archivist of the Magnus \nInstitute, London. \nStatement begins. \nARCHIVIST (STATEMENT) \nSo it’s another statement is it? Like I owe you something? Even though I \nwarned you the handle might have splinters, that you should always be \n\nwearing gloves if you’re going to try firing it. And you knew where it was from, \nthe signs of rage and violence to be watching for. So far, I don’t see how it’s my \nfault, and I don’t consider myself liable. That said, I don’t want you thinking I \ndon’t appreciate you keeping it quiet. You all have been one of my most stable \ncustomers, and I’d hate to sour the business. So I suppose if it’s a statement \nyou’re wanting… it’s no inconvenience to me. I don’t sleep well anyway. \nSo what’s it going to be? Could go over what got me started in the business; \nthat’s a story I haven’t told you yet. Though there’s less in the telling than you \nmight expect. My first job was working with Jurgen Leitner, but I got out of \nthat years before the man met his fate. Started looking for the exit about the \ntime that I saw Warren get literally eaten by a book. And before you start \ncross-referencing, looking for some newly-birthed monster called Warren, I \ndon’t mean eaten like that. It left behind the leg. Don’t know any \ntransformations that leave behind your leg. \nSo I gave Leitner my walking papers, and struck out on my own. I had no \nintention of following in his footsteps with the books, and when I began it was \njust normal, high-end antiques I was moving. Leitner’s client list, which I’d \ntaken the liberty of copying, did me proud. The man had a knack for sniffing \nout moneyed fools with no sense of the value of things. Combine that with my \nown skill at evading a lot of the ‘legal entanglements’ the trade can get caught \nup in, and making money was not much of a challenge. Once or twice one of \nthem would try to sell me a book, but when I learn a lesson, I learn it to my \nbones. After a while, some of those familiar with Leitner and his library \napproached me with some of the more… unusual items they had locked away. \nThe sort of thing they’d have sold to him if they’d been bound in paper, rather \nthan ceramic or wood. I didn’t want anything to do with them, not to begin \n\nwith, but you’ve seen for yourself that the artifacts are not so volatile as the \nbooks, and they fetch a pretty penny, so eventually I started dealing in them as \nwell. \nSo there’s that. But I don’t think that’s the sort of statement you’re after is it? \nNo. You want something a little ghoulish. Something to stick your teeth into. \nFine. I’ve got one. You see, in this game there are a few rules it’s a good idea to \nkeep to if you’re looking to stay alive. One of my mine, is that only I take stock \nof the merchandise. You want to know how I came by this rule? I know you do. \nSo there was a man worked on my ship. Let’s call him ‘Cook’. Not his real name \nof course, but real enough for this and, thinking about it, it’s unlikely he signed \nup with his real name anyway. \nNow Cook, his main job was what you’d expect: working in the galley to keep \nmy small crew fed. \nBut on a ship like that, all of you pitch in all of the time, even me, and cooking a \nfew meals a day doesn’t stop you having other duties. And one of those duties \nwas checking on the cargo, making sure none of the breakables had managed \nto, well, break. Any other crew I’d have been worried about theft, but I’d been \nwith most of these for two or three years, so there plenty of trust there. \nThis must have been some time in September, back in ‘99, and for most of the \njourney Cook had been checking on the merchandise with no problem at all. \nBut on the last week or so of that voyage, he’d been taking longer and longer, \nand it was starting to affect meal times, and so on one of those occasions I \nmade my way down to check on him. And, of course, I found him staring into \none of the boxes.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 0, "chunk_count": 5, "chars": 4384}}
