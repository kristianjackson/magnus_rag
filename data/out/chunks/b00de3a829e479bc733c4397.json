Original statement given November 30th 2006. Audio \nrecording by Jonathan Sims, the Archivist. \nStatement begins. \nARCHIVIST (STATEMENT) \nArthur asked me to tell you that Agnes Montague is dead. He asked me \nspecifically because he knew I’d have to write my whole bloody story down for \nyou and it would hurt like hell. But I talked out of turn to him, suggested that \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 139 – Chosen \n2 \n \nwe ought to just burn this whole place to the ground with you inside, so I \nsuppose this counts as my punishment. He thinks I’m just afraid enough of him \nnot to make good on my threats without his say so. He’s probably right. Just as \nwell you’re not here. Smart move on your part. But they always are, aren’t \nthey? Smart moves. Someday you’re going to push your luck too far, and when \nyou do... Well, you’d better hope it isn’t Jude who comes to collect. \nSo me? I was born in ‘36. I know, I don’t look 70, but burning the candle at all \nends does have a few advantages. Until you burn out entirely, at least. It’s hard \nto say how much I’ve got left in me, how much longer my sacrifices can buy \nme. But when I go, you’d better believe I’m going big. And it is going to hurt. \nYou know I got my start in the Blitz? I remember it like it was yesterday. It was \nGlenn Dunlop’s house that did it, you know. We were always playing together \noutside, and sometimes his mum would give us tea. Well, it was gone. Nothing \nbut rubble and... desolation. Glenn and his parents had been in the shelter out \nback, but I guess it wasn’t quite sheltered enough, and only his dad made it \nout. He was a tall, strong man, used to work as a stevedore, and I’d never seen \nhim without a stern expression and a pipe. But now, staggering through the \nruins of his life, the look I saw on his face, it woke something inside me. \nSomething truly awful. \nAnyone who talks about “the Blitz spirit” wasn’t there, or wants to paper over \ntheir fear with nostalgia. Terrible things happened in the blackout, and we hurt \neach other just as much as the Germans hurt us. And I hurt so very many \npeople. A building fire is a dreadful thing, but so much more terrible when it's \nshining out into the night. \n \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 139 – Chosen \n3 \n \nIt was the first of my crimes, but not the last, and arson has always been my \nthing. It’s such a simple way to destroy everything someone has built, both \nliterally and figuratively. I found my god through my own path, served it in my \nown way. And when Arthur and Diego found me, told me there were others \nthat shared my devotion, well, I can’t say it doesn’t feel nice to belong. Even if \nwe do have our little disagreements. \nAnd one of those disagreements came down to... I suppose you could call it \ndestiny. We all felt the calling, the dreams, pulling us ever closer to a world of \nfire and loss, a place of burning and agony when we remade the world in the \nimage of the Lightless Flame, the one Diego calls Asag. We all felt it, longed for \nit, but a longing is not the same thing as an instruction. We’d all been touched \nand warped by proximity to the holy burning fire, but none of us had any \nspecial knowledge, no matter what Diego claims he might have read. He \nwanted a grand inferno, a ritual of apocalyptic burning that would make the \nfirebombing of Dresden look like a sparkler. \nWhich sounded amazing, but a few of us pointed out that the Allied air force \nhad a tad more firepower than we did, as none of us were likely to make the \nrank of Air Marshal any time soon. And that’s when Arthur proposed his own \nplan. A chosen one. We would create a messiah, the Flame Incarnate, one who \ncould usher in this new world and lead us in what Diego called the Scoured \nEarth. \nWhen we finally decided, it was Eileen Montague who came forward as a \nvolunteer. She was five months pregnant at the time, and had already taken \ncare of the father in the usual manner of our little congregation.
