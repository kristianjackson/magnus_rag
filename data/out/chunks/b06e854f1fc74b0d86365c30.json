Dead friend. Monster. Regarding his unavoidable and gruesome end. \nHow he tried to hide. He couldn’t. Statement is from… 1983, March 2nd. And I \nguess… I guess I’m doing this one. Tim Stoker.

I was always afraid, but they were \nju–” \nUgh, this is stupid. \nThis is stupid. Look, if, if anyone’s listening to this useless tape, it was stupid \nwhen John was doing it, and it’s stupid now. I mean, I mean, just what’s the \npoint? We might as well be engraving them on wax cylinders. \n[The statement rustles.] \nWhoever is listening to this, right now: you’re wasting your time. And if you \nwork for the Magnus Institute, get out. If you can.

Yeah, you work here now. \nMELANIE \nYou sound thrilled. \nTIM \nIt’s not you. It’s his fault. He didn’t warn you properly, and now you’re trapped \nhere. With us. \nMELANIE \nOh, is this, this whole ‘you can’t quit because of spooky magic’ deal? \nTIM \nYeah. You tried? \nMELANIE \nNo. And I’m not going to. I need a job, and it’s fine here. I like it. It’s quiet. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG086 – Tucked In \n4 \n \nTIM \nSure. If you ignore all the corpses. And the monsters. And the disappearances. \nMELANIE \nOh, trust me, you’ll find plenty of those elsewhere. If this whole ‘give quitting a \ntry’ thing is meant to be some kind of subtle hint… I… I just feel like you two \ndon’t want me here. \nTIM \nWe don’t. Martin’s not big on change. I don’t want anyone to be here. \nMELANIE \nWell, thanks for making me feel like part of the team. \nTIM \nYou’re suspicious and resentful, right? Welcome aboard. \nMELANIE \nGood talk. \nTIM \nWait. Tell me about the two Sashas. \nMELANIE \nOh? What? \nTIM \nMartin said you were rambling about there being two Sashas. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG086 – Tucked In \n5 \n \nMELANIE \nLook, I don’t, I don’t know, I… um, well, the… the first time I came to give a \nstatement, there was a young woman working here named Sasha, er, and then \nwhen I, when I came in again there was a different woman working here. And \neveryone called her Sasha as well, which… I didn’t think it was too strange. I \nmean, i-i-it’s a common name, but everyone kept saying they were the same \nperson and, and they weren’t. At all! John kept saying there’d only ever been \none Sasha working there, but they were totally different. And everyone’s been \ngiving me really strange looks whenever I talk about it. \nTIM \nWhat did she look like? \nMELANIE \nWhat? Sorry? \nTIM \nThe first Sasha. What… What was she like? \nMELANIE \nUh, she was… um… I don’t, er… maybe I’m… I’m getting it wrong. I just… okay, I \ncan’t, er – \nTIM \nNo. I… think I understand. \nMELANIE \nWell, can you explain?", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 0, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 3806}}
