I remember \nonce, when I was a child, we went on a school trip to White Scar Cave up in \nYorkshire. It was a lovely, safe, accessible cave and was absolutely beautiful, \nwhich I suppose is why it was popular for such trips. After we’d been down \nthere for a few minutes, the guide led us much deeper, and told us to stand \nvery quietly. She turned off the lights, to show us children what true darkness \nis like. I’d never seen anything like it. It was such a pure black, so \nencompassing, and in the warmth of the underground I found myself full of a \njoy I’ve never forgotten. Even among a class of thirty schoolchildren, I felt like \nthe only presence that mattered was the cave. Ever since then I would always \ntake a moment on any potholing trip to do the same, and feel again that utter \ndarkness, with no sound but the gently flowing river and my own breathing. I \ndon’t think it’s an uncommon practice, actually, but I rarely went caving with \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG015 – Lost John’s Cave \n5 \n \nanyone other than Alena and, while she indulged me, I don’t think she really \ngot anything out of it. \nWe turned our lights back on, and began to head deeper into the cave. I had a \nmap, which we began to follow as closely as we could. I’m quite experienced in \nthese things but even I find it hard sometimes to match the irregular lines and \nangles of the underground passages to the often abstract shapes written into \nthe map. There were several junctions that were significantly smaller than the \nmap would seem to show, and the point of entry into Lost John’s Cave was \nwhat we would call a squeeze. It wasn’t on the map, but it seemed to be the \nonly way through. \nNow, most passages you find yourself travelling through when caving are much \nsmaller than would normally be comfortable for people to move through. After \nall, they were eroded by often tiny streams of water and minor tectonic \nevents, so accommodating humans was never high on their list of priorities. A \nsqueeze is something different, though. A squeeze can be a hole less than a \nfoot wide, sometimes going on for a long way, the rock pressing in on all sides \nof you, and your helmet banging whenever you try to turn your head. In a \nparticularly bad squeeze, there are parts where the walls and ceiling are so \nclose that you can’t move your arms or bend your legs to push forward, and \nyou just have to squirm your way to the other side like a worm. This was a \nparticularly bad squeeze. Near the end it got so bad that, if Alena hadn’t gone \nin first, I would have told her to go back and forget Lost John’s Cave. \nAbout half way through I realised that it was far tighter than I had imagined. I \ncalled ahead, to make sure Alena had made it out okay. She called back, told \nme it was a hard one, but she was fine. I wanted to answer her, but by that \npoint the rock was so close around me it was stopping me from doing anything", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 2, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 2924}}
