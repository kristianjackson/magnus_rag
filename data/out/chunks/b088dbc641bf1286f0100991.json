Sasha \nhas recently been having problems with her normal backdoor access to police \nrecords, as despite IT’s best efforts, her computer has broken yet again, \nmaking this the third time in the last two months. Until we can source some \nmore reliable equipment, we may have to rely on other methods. \nBasira has refused to compromise her position any further, so we’re having to \nrely on Tim’s involvement with certain staff at the police records office. \nApparently, he is involved both with one of the young ladies there, as well as \nthe gentleman who manages the other shift. This is useful for acquiring \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG049 – The Butcher’s Window \n13 \n \ninformation, but I am uncomfortable with how easily discovered this \narrangement might be. The last thing I want is for the Archives to become \ninvolved in pointless personal drama. \nStill, he has managed to get copies of the appropriate files. The police did raid \nthe butcher shop following Mr Pryor’s report, but found no one there. It had \napparently been abandoned shortly before. They found articles and clothing \nbelonging to roughly fourteen people, five of whom could be tied to active \nmissing persons’ cases. They did tear up the floor in the end, but rather than \nany sort of pit, they found the body of one Harry Gogh, the registered owner of \nthe business. He had apparently been dead for six months. Jared Hopworth \nremains at large. \nEnd recording. \n[CLICK] \n[CLICK] \nSupplemental. \nElias Bouchard is a difficult man to pin down, certainly since he became head \nof the Institute in 1996, taking over from James Wright, who ran the place \nfrom ‘73 until he passed away. It was a remarkably fast climb to the top, as, \nfrom what I can find, it looks like he only joined the Institute five years before, \nin 1991, working in the artefact storage. Perhaps he was simply that \nimpressive. Certainly, the Elias I know now is almost unmatched in terms of \nparanormal knowledge. Well, theoretical knowledge, at least. \nAnd yet. Everything I’ve found about his life before the Institute seems an ill fit \nwith the austere man I know. He apparently graduated with a 3rd from \nChristchurch college in PPE, and I found an old gossip column in the student \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG049 – The Butcher’s Window \n14 \n \nnewspaper, The Cherwell, that mentioned him. If I’m not reading too much \ninto it, the implication seems to be that he was something of a pothead. Was \nhe like that when he first came to work here? The difficulty comes from the \nfact that the only person in the Institute who worked here before he took over \nwas Gertrude. Did he kill her because she knew something about his past? And \nif so, how can I prove it? \nEnd supplemental. \n[CLICK] \n \n[The Magnus Archives Theme - Outro] \n \nThe Magnus Archives is a podcast distributed by Rusty Quill and licensed under \na creative commons attribution, non-commercial share alike 4.0 international \nlicense.
