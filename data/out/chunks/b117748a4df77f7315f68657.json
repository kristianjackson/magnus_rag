The Magnus Archives. Episode one hundred and eighty-\none: \"Ignorance.\" \n[Theme finishes] \n[Tape clicks on] \n[Opera music is playing from a speaker; there is the faint sound of \nbirdsong; and an antique clock ticks] \n[Sounds of glassware and pouring liquid; ice clicks; soft footsteps \non carpet] \nMIKAELE \nHmmm. \n[Close mic bumps as the recorder is handled] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 181 – Ignorance \n2 \nMIKAELE \n(Very close) Interesting... \n[Three knocks on a wooden door] \n[Salesa puts the recorder down; ice clinks from the drink he is \nholding] \nAh, of course! Come in, come in! \n[Door creaks opens] \nMARTIN \nEr… Mr… Salesa? \nMIKAELE \nMikaele, please! Come in. \nDid you sleep well? Have you had something to eat? Annabelle said she’d \nshown you the pantry? \n[Salesa turns off the opera music] \nARCHIVIST \n(Uncomfortable) I...er… We slept. I-I don’t know— H-How long’s it been? \nMIKAELE \nAbout seventy-one hours by my clock. How’re you feeling? \n(Martin pffts in surprise) \nARCHIVIST \nDisorientated. It’s like, um, like I’ve lost my sight or, or— \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 181 – Ignorance \n3 \nMIKAELE \nWell, you have, haven’t you? \n(He chuckles; it isn’t the friendliest sound) \nAnnabelle tells me you work for The Eye. \nARCHIVIST \nW-I-I w-wouldn’t exactly say I-I ‘work for’ it. \nMARTIN \nWell… I-I-I mean, you say that, but when you stop to think about it, it was \nliterally our employer, John, so… meh? \nARCHIVIST \nI-I suppose. \nMIKAELE \n(Friendly chuckles) I like this one. Come on, sit down, have a drink. \n[Salesa sits and unscrews a bottle; there is the clinking sounds of \nglass and ice as he prepares a drink; Martin and the Archivist also \ntake a seat] \nMARTIN \nYou’re sure? What time is it? Oh. Huh. I can actually ask that question here. \nMIKAELE \nYou can indeed. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 181 – Ignorance \n4 \nMARTIN \nAnd the sun’s high, so... \n[Mikaela finishes making the drink] \nMIKAELE \nGood eye... Martin, was it? \nMARTIN \nEr, er… Yes. \nMIKAELE \nWell Martin. It’s about ten in the morning. More or less. \nMARTIN \nAnd you’re drinking? \nMIKAELE \nOf course! Even in my little bubble of peace, I find drinking after dark leads to \nsome rather morbid thoughts. \nMARTIN \nRight. \nARCHIVIST \nWhat is… this place? \nMIKAELE \nI just told you, it’s my little bubble. My silver lining on an otherwise cloudy day. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 181 – Ignorance \n5 \nARCHIVIST \nThat’s not an answer— \nMIKAELE \nNow tell me, do you know why there’s a tape recorder here? I noticed it just \nnow, but I don’t believe I actually own one. \nARCHIVIST \nUh... Not really. \nMARTIN \nThey sort of just … follow us round. \nMIKAELE \nHmmmm. Interesting. Did you carry it in? Things shouldn’t be able to manifest \nin here like that. \nARCHIVIST \nYou had one in your… bag, I-I think, Martin? Did, did you drop it here? \nMARTIN \nEr, I don’t think so. \nMIKAELE \nVery well. In that case, we shall leave it to be. It’s hardly valuable, and it’s \nprobably best not to upset whatever it might be involved with. Besides, I have \nno secrets to hide. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 181 – Ignorance \n6 \nARCHIVIST \nSo… you wouldn’t mind answering a few questions? \n[Mikaela takes a sip of his drink] \nMIKAELE \n…I am an open book. \nMARTIN \n(Scoffs) In my experience, open books can actually be pretty dangerous. \nMIKAELE \nHa! I do like this one! \n[Puts his drink down] \nMIKAELE (CONT’D) \nNow you mention it, you actually remind me of Jurgen a bit. In his younger \ndays of course. You’re sure you won’t have a drink? We definitely had some \ntea around here somewhere… \nMARTIN \nEr, I, I already had some, thank you. Some of us know how to be polite guests. \nARCHIVIST \n(Sharply) I don’t intend to accept anything offered by Annabelle Cane. \nMIKAELE \nOh, you know Annabelle?", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 0, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 4057}}
