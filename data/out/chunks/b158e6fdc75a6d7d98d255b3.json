She was like no one I’d met before in my life. She was \nbeautiful, like a- like a shark is beautiful. Every moment she made was \ndeliberate, sharp, and her eyes were always focused on something, always \nwatching. And when she looked at me, I always felt afraid. \nBut there was something else. Something under the fear. Something that made \nme feel very aware of all my blood. \n(Exhale) I don’t know what she saw in me, not really. But when she walked up \nto me and told me that I was taking her to dinner, I couldn’t help but nod. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 154 – Bloody Mary \nI’ve always been- (sheepish laugh) Well, now, I wouldn’t call myself a coward, \nbut I’ve never been in a fight. Never even been punched. Maybe it’s- luck. \nMaybe it’s the fact that I can never really bring myself to push back from \npeople. \nAnd Mary pushed so hard. Harder, even, than you. And I let her, because she \ngave me something I had never before experienced: Danger. \nThe things she taught me, had me do- I’d never known anything like it. \nWhenever I kissed her, it tasted like blood. \nI knew what she was, I,I think. What she was capable of. But I convinced myself \nthat I was safe, that she loved me. It made me feel special. That I was \nsomehow protected from all the cold cruelty that she tried to keep hidden, but \nleaked out in so many ways. \nI remember visiting her, shortly after she’d started her books business. I found \nher sitting opposite a corpse, a well-dressed middle-aged man who sat in a \nhuge armchair she kept in the back office. She looked me in the eye and told \nme he was her uncle, prone to drink, making an unexpected visit, and had \npassed out in the chair. \n(Amused, wistful hm) I knew she didn’t have an uncle. I knew the man was \ndead. \nShe didn’t lie to me because she expected me to believe her; she lied to me \nbecause she expected me to obey her. And I did. We rescheduled our date to \nthe following day. \nBut d’you know what the strange thing is? Despite the violence, death, even \nmy own murder, I still don’t feel like she... betrayed me. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 154 – Bloody Mary \nShe was what she was. And I knew that. And even though I told myself that she \nwould never harm me- of course not! I was her husband, her true love- even \nthen, the only one lying was me. \nShe never promised anything, not even in her vows. She never betrayed me. \nNot like you. She never played dumb when I was stalked by bloated, blood-\nsoaked things, or told me I was imagining it when your friend Adelard dropped \na screaming box into the Thames. She didn’t try to keep me in the dark just so I \nwouldn’t stop being useful; she never made me complicit in a thousand \ndifferent nightmares, and lives ruined for the sick joy of some otherworldly \nvoyeur. \nCompared to that, I suppose a few murders were easier to stomach. \nBut I couldn’t be part of it. Not once Mary told me what was really going on. \nI know what you say, what you think you’re doing, saving the world one poor \ndoomed soul at a time- I mean, I understand; I do. (Exhale) But I couldn’t be a \npart of it. Not when I saw what happened to everyone else you involved. \nI had to get out, to escape this place. I had a son to look after; he needed me! \nOr so I thought. \nAnd that’s when you turned nasty, isn’t it? When all your resources, they no \nlonger want to serve your purpose. I suppose you didn’t know there was a way \nout, a way to escape. But if you had, would you have told me? \nMary, at least, played straight with me. She knew all about the Institute. And \nwhen we were married, when she was sure I could handle it, she laid it all out", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 3, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 3781}}
