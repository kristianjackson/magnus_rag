I see it, and watch the \npassing of history build upon it, layer after layer. To travel down into the \nground is to travel through time, that’s what I always used to say, before I \nfound my book. And I still believe it, but time is the least of the things that \nwaits for us down there, things I can barely think of without collapsing in fear. \nA thousand terrible things, trapped and alone, out of air and out of light, all \ncontained within those three hideous letters: DIG. \nIn those dreams I hold a spade. It screams when I plunge it into the weeping \nsoil, and the voice it cries out with is my own. The soft mud begs me to stop, \ntrying in vain to save me. But I do not listen, and the pitted ruin of my shovel \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG088 – Dig \n11 \n \nmoves lump after lump of it, tearing it free of itself, and piling it around me, \nsculpting my own grave. Bringing the ground up to meet me where I must be \nburied. It fills my lungs, and I am free. I am awake. The shovel is in my hand, \nand the book is open to its chapter and verse: DIG. \nIn the moments without the shovel, without the torn ground, I have tried to \nfind out more about the book, maybe even get rid of it. A bookseller I asked \nabout it pointed me towards you and yours, before I dug into him, and so here \nI came. To tell my story, of course, but another thing as well; cold, empty and \ncalling. There’s something here, you see. Something to be dug up, rooted out, \nburied within. A hollow space that all eyes point towards. And I intend to reach \nit, if my fingers don’t give out first. I know where to dig. \nMARTIN \nUh, um, the, uh, the statement ends rather abruptly there. Based on a few \nscattered notes and accounts from some of the older staff, it sounds like Mr. \nMacmillan got in a bit of a fight, which led to his arrest, and the replacement of \nquite a bit of the floor in John’s office. There are still a couple of boards with \nmarks on them that I’d always hoped weren’t fingernail scratches, but I guess… \nAnyway, Mr. Macmillan passed away while awaiting trial. Official cause of \ndeath is listed as “asphyxiation”, but I can’t find any details about exactly what \nhappened. The book is currently held by Artefact Storage in a welded iron box, \nand placed on the top of the Do Not Access list, but since then it doesn’t look \nlike it’s caused anything weird to happen. \n[Someone knocks on the door.] \nEr, yes? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG088 – Dig \n12 \n \n[Melanie opens the door.] \nMELANIE \nHi, have you got a moment? \nMARTIN \nUm, yeah, I think, um… \nMELANIE \nAre you alright? \nMARTIN \nYeah… Sorry, just a lot of change recently, y’know. You and John and Sasha \nand… everything’s gone a bit wrong. \nIt’s the not knowing, you know? I mean, John’s still alive. Not sure why, but I’m \nsure of that. But Sasha, I… \nMELANIE \nYes, it’s… it’s probably, um… \nMARTIN \nSorry, sorry, I’m – What do you need? \nMELANIE \nOh, right, yes. Is there any sort of database, maybe? \n(Martin snorts) \nMELANIE \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG088 – Dig \n13 \n \nStatement givers or people referenced? I’m trying to get hold of a witness from \na recent one. \nMARTIN \nYeah, yeah, I wish. That would… I mean, that would make the job a lot easier. \nMELANIE \nNo-one’s even tried to make one? \nMARTIN \nOh, you weren’t here when we took the place over from Gertrude. It’s been \nover a year just to get it like this. I mean, I think the database was on John’s \nlist, but… \nMELANIE \nSo how do you track someone down? \nMARTIN \nOh, oh well, y’know, we’ve a few contacts in various record offices around the \nplace. Aside from that it’s just… just a bit of detective work, really. Er, Tim used \nto do a great line in impersonating people to utility companies. Ah, the number \nof times he got them to give him ‘his own’ address… \nMELANIE \nRight, right… Um, this one, the name is “Jude Perry”. Doesn’t mean anything to \nyou, does it? \nMARTIN \nUh… no.
