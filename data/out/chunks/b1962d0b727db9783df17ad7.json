(shaky inhale) an old \nfriend. \nMARTIN \n...Oh. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 165 – Revolutions \n6 \nARCHIVIST \nYeah. I'd really rather not deal with her if we can avoid it. \nMARTIN \nYeah, good call, um, in that case, do you want to… do your thing now then, \nbefore we start moving? But are we, close enough? \nARCHIVIST \nYes. Yes, I-I think so. Good idea. \nMARTIN \nThanks. \nARCHIVIST \nYou, uh. You might want to take a bit of a walk. This feels like a strange one. \nMARTIN \nWhat does… strange mean, with something like this? \nARCHIVIST \nDon't think you want to know. \nMARTIN \nGood point! Um, okay, well, uh, good luck; I'll be, uh, o-over there. \n[Martin walks away] \nARCHIVIST \nRight. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 165 – Revolutions \n7 \n[Hissing static starts] \n[The ‘Unknowing’ music, metal groans and gears, and screams \nbecomes clearer and louder] \nARCHIVIST \nYour face is not your face is not your face \naround the curling carousel it twists \n[Hissing static ends] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nin place to take from you and all the tattered stolen souls \nwho sense of me is swollen and distended into nothing. \nRound and round and round it goes \nand when it deigns to stop who you might be you cannot know \nso touch and feel the skin atop your skull to test \nthe limits and extremities of where this canvas comes to rest \nin robbed identities and peeling names that you could swear were never yours. \n \nThe music swells through you. \nThe music vomits from you. \nThe music calls a name that through the tears of half-grasped memories seems \nalmost and eternally familiar. \nSo dance. \n \nDance to the beat of the thump of the chase of the still and plastic horse \nhooves \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 165 – Revolutions \n8 \nwhich cannot break from where they are secured by bolts and glue and \neggshell-thin reality \nthat paints a visage of sense almost enough to tell you that the nausea that \nswells \nand pushes at the limits of your mind is incorrect. \nThere's nothing wrong. \nThe world in which the carousel will twirl is not the hollow hell you fear; it is \nthe world. \nJust the world. \nA world where if you'd wished to have a name it must be stolen, carved and \npulled full-bloody \nfrom the frame of others who would wish in vain to hold their selfness close. \n \nYou want a face? Take it. There are so many here, and those who cannot hold \nthem, well, whoever chose to give them such a gift must take the blame, \nknowing they could never keep it in a world of so much thieving strangeness. \nAnd soon enough they will forget they ever even had one, rest assured; it's \nbest to step the dance and keep your face secured as much as you are able. \nJust. Keep. Running. \n \nYour feet (or are they just the shoes with emptiness within?) \nwill pound upon the creaking wood of carousel-top (or perhaps the only \nground there's ever been?) \nso struggle not to look behind (though can you trust your eyes to tell you quite \nwhat it might be that dogs your steps?) \nand see the poor procession of those gory, faceless wretches who have lost \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 165 – Revolutions \n9 \npossession now of all their treasured once-identities to those who are now \nthem? Like you. \nYou tire of the chase of course, the fire and all-relentless pace of competition \nreaching for a name, identity, and face that has long since worn \nthrough all reserves of hard-enduring vigour in you \nyet still you only stay a self while willing on your aching legs that feel like \nbreaking just to \nkeep you forward of the frenzied fray of hazy clawed who are yous. \n \nSo run. Just run. \nAnd listen to the music of your panicked flight from those who long to take \nwhat you have stole from those no longer worth a name. \n \nEver onwards, forward on the curling path of merry-go-round that's twisted, \nwound, and spinning in its harrowing sound of organ piping circus tunes that \nmerrily hound the steps of your escape. Could you turn a thought and burn \nyour lead on your pursuers, an ankle change a charge now perpendicular to \nyour intended line of best retreat, and stake it all on one last hope, your \nbruised feet pounding to the edge? The boundary. Don't stop the ride. But you \nstill want to get off. \n \nBut no, for all the dreams of bounding, leaping off into the great unknown, you \nsee the ring of broken mewling wretches who have shown the sting that comes \nwith such rejection of the truth, so seldom spoken yet inside you all that there \nis no way off the merry-go-round.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 1, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 4465}}
