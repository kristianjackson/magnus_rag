So does this mean...? \nMELANIE \nYes. And I’ve got my plane to India already booked. \nARCHIVIST \nEven after your experience with the hospital train? It sounds like this could be \nfar more dangerous... \nMELANIE \nOh thank you but I don't need your fake concern. I’ve heard them talking \nupstairs. You know this obsession even better than I do. I just wanted to make \nmy statement... \nARCHIVIST \nIn case you get murdered by ghosts. \nMELANIE \nYes. \nARCHIVIST \nI understand. Thank you, Melanie. \nMELANIE \nSure. Where’s Sasha, by the way? I wanted to say goodbye. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG076 – The Smell of Blood \n12 \n \nARCHIVIST \nI’m sorry? \nMELANIE \nSasha. Your assistant. I haven’t seen her in a while. You didn’t fire her, did you? \nARCHIVIST \nI’m not sure I understand, she brought you down here. \nMELANIE \nOh... No, is that another Sasha? Are you collecting them? \nARCHIVIST \nNo, no, there’s just... there’s just Sasha. \nMELANIE \nYou know who I mean. Tall, long hair, glasses... She was here when I first came \nin. Back last April? We had a long conversation about haunted pubs. \nARCHIVIST \nNo, I... I remember. But that is Sasha. \nMELANIE \nRight, okay, um... are you trying to gaslight me or something? \nARCHIVIST \nWhat? No! \nMELANIE \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG076 – The Smell of Blood \n13 \n \nIs this a joke to you? \nARCHIVIST \nNo! No... I... I... \nMELANIE \nBecause I am not crazy. And that is not the same woman I met before! \nARCHIVIST \nYes it is! I mean... What? \nMELANIE \nThere is something very wrong with you. \nARCHIVIST \nNo... what? \n[Tape clicks off. Tape clicks on.] \nI... um... I haven’t followed up on Melanie’s statement. I just keep thinking \nabout what she said about Sasha. She was so certain. I mean, it’s Sasha. \nObviously it’s Sasha. But... something... There’s more than one thing in the files \nthat can trick you. I can’t just ignore it. So many stories about things that aren’t \nas they appear to be. Why Melanie, though? If... Why... It doesn’t matter. I \nneed to do more research. When Melanie came in I was looking through the \nbox of tapes Basira gave me, trying to decide where to start. Now I think... I \nthink I have an idea. \nEnd supplemental. \n[The Magnus Archives Theme – Outro] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG076 – The Smell of Blood \n14 \n \nThe Magnus Archives is a podcast distributed by Rusty Quill and licensed under \na Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Sharealike 4.0 International \nlicence. \nToday’s episode was written by Jonathan Sims and directed by Alexander J \nNewall.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 5, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 2662}}
