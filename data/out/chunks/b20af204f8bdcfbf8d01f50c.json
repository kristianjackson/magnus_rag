I don’t want to be mad. I don’t think I am, but \nthere’s no way really to know, is there? \nAfter a month of this, I finally sat down and watched it through to the end. It \nwas the longest day of my life and by the end I felt so very sick. I almost threw \nup when he smiled. Finally, he lay down in front of the camera and said, “The \nmaze is sharp on my mind. The angles cut me when I try to think.” Then he \nstopped moving. I could see the top of his head then and the back of it seemed \nto be missing. The picture stayed like that for about half an hour and then the \nvideo ended. I haven’t seen it since. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 065 – Binary \n13 \n \nI keep thinking about the idea of uploading your mind into a computer. I said it \nwas impossible. I still think it’s impossible, in the way we want it to be. But I \ncan’t stop wondering what it must be like to try and have thoughts, messy, \nhuman thoughts, trapped in the rigid digital processes of a computer. It must \nhurt, though not a sort of pain that we can understand. \nIs that enough? Do you have what you need? \nARCHIVIST \nI think, uh... yes, I think we do. \nTESSA \nThe way you’re looking at me, I’m going to assume you don’t know anything \nmore about this than I do. \nARCHIVIST \n(Sighs) Not really, I’m afraid. I can talk you through some other encounters \nwe’ve recorded with supposedly haunted computers and I think one of our \npostgrad students is working on something about supernatural manifestations \nin technology, but I don’t think we have anything else like this. \nTESSA \nYeah, I figured. I just saw your post and thought, why not? And it does feel \ngood to talk about it, you know? \nARCHIVIST \nYes, I... very much understand. Oh, while I have you... \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 065 – Binary \n14 \n \n[Tape clicks off. Tape clicks on.] \nARCHIVIST \nSupplemental. It looks like my posting on a few of the more tech-savvy boards \nappealing for statements has worked. While the incident itself seems \nultimately inconsequential, I was able to convince Tessa to have a look at \nGertrude’s laptop, claiming to have locked myself out. I don’t know what she \ndid, something about command lines and administrative privileges, but I now \nhave access. I’m almost afraid to... \n[Door opens] \nTIM \nHey, where did you put the– \n[Laptop shuts] \nOh, sorry. Didn’t mean to disturb you while you were being suspicious. \nARCHIVIST \nIt’s fine. \nTIM \nNo, no, I’ll catch you when you’re not scheming. \nARCHIVIST \n(Quiet) No need to take that tone. \nTIM \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 065 – Binary \n15 \n \nWhat? \nARCHIVIST \nNothing. I’ll see you later. \nTIM \nNo. What did you say? \nARCHIVIST \nI said there’s no need for the attitude. I know things have been difficult but– \nTIM \nOh, they have, have they? “Things” have been difficult? You’ve spent a month \nstaring at that footage, double checking every moment, timing every tea break, \nlooking at me like I’ve somehow staged it. But no, you’re right. “Things” have \nbeen difficult. \nARCHIVIST \nIt just seems a little too convenient. \nTIM \nExcuse me? \nARCHIVIST \nI mean, the CCTV is so corrupted that the police can’t just use it immediately, \nand then they happen to finish restoring it just when I start really digging into \nthe murder? And if it was an option, why not clean it up when she first \ndisappeared? And don’t get me started on the lack of cameras in the archives. I \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 065 – Binary \n16 \n \nknow, I know, Elias’ whole spiel about signal degradation and installation \nissues, but I don’t buy it. I mean, he got the CO2 system put in easily enough. \nTIM \nShut. Up. \nARCHIVIST \nWhat? \nTIM \nShut up! Just stop talking. I’m sick of this! I’m sick of you! We didn’t kill \nGertrude and no one wants to kill you, you pompous idiot! \n[Fist banging on table] \nARCHIVIST \nNow listen here, Tim... \nTIM \nNo! No, you listen for once. I was fine in research. Happy. Then you ask me to \nbe transferred here and suddenly it’s all monsters and killers and secret \npassages, oh my! And the worst thing, the actual worst thing, is that no one \nhere has my back. With any of it. Elias doesn’t care, Martin just wants a tea \nparty and Sasha... uh, and you, you’re treating me like I’m somehow to blame \nfor it all, like I didn’t suffer the worst, right alongside you. \nARCHIVIST \nWell excuse me if my experiences have made me–", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 6, "chunk_count": 9, "chars": 4444}}
