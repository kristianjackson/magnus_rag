There were \npeople striding down the main avenue, past the well-lit booths trying to entice \nthem with coconut throws and hoop games. The rollercoaster rattled along in \nthe background, the faint screams of its riders drifting over the crowds below. \nFor a few seconds it seemed almost legitimately joyful. \nBut as he watched, a certain wrongness began to become clear. \nMeaningless details, if they were confined to a single punter, but all the park-\ngoers seemed the same. \nThe first was how baggy their clothes were. It almost seemed as though \neveryone was wearing some sort of oversized novelty t-shirt. But it was the \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 156 – Reflection \nsame with the shirts, jackets, dresses- until it became apparent that it was not \nthe clothes that were too big, but the wearers who were too small. \nTheir limbs were painfully thin to look at, their flesh stretched tightly over \njutting bones, and the fabric hung off them like great flaps of skin. The hair on \neach head was thin, almost wispy, often missing in great chunks, and their eyes \nwere sunken so hollow that from a distance they seemed empty. \nThis is when our unfortunate interloper began to feel the first stirrings of fear. \nHe began to move, slowly and quietly, outside, his utter bafflement at what \nwas happening briefly overpowering his mounting dread. It wasn’t just a few of \nthem. Everyone in the park was so emaciated that they barely seemed human- \nbut they seemed to be acting normally, at least for the moment. \nHe moved slowly through the shadows of the rickety wooden structures, \nwatching them pass, until his eyes fell upon the coconut shy. \n’WIN BREAD,’ the sign announced in bold colours, but a huge black cross had \nbeen struck through it, and from this distance the prize bucket seemed empty. \nEven so, a woman stood there, hurling a well-worn leather ball at the hairy \ntargets in the back. As she knocked one from its perch, her face contorted into \na grimace of joy, and the wizened carnie hobbled over to one of the buckets \nand handed her a tiny bone. \nWithout hesitation, she snapped it cleanly in half and started desperately \ngnawing at the broken end, trying to reach whatever scant marrow might have \nremained inside. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 156 – Reflection \nOur lost young friend felt his stomach turn. He told me he was a good fifteen \nfeet away, but could still hear the sounds of her desperate hunger over the \nrides all around. \nThe woman began to examine the bone in her hand closely, then turned and \nbegan railing at the carnie, accusing him of cheating her, of lying about the \nprizes. \nThis was all too much for our witness, who had decided that whatever was \ngoing on in this place, he wanted no part of it. But as he turned to look for a \nway out, there was a sound that cut through the background din of the park: It \nwas a scream from the rollercoaster, but not the joyful cry of adrenaline and \nmock terror, but a dreadful, piercing wail, flying through the air. \nIt seemed one of the riders, unable to properly benefit from the safety bar, \nhad been thrown from the height of a loop, and was sailing through the air, \nlanding on the unforgiving ground of the main avenue with a horrendous \ncrunch. \nA sudden silence fell over the place. The rides still whirred and rang and \njangled, but every person there had gone completely still, their eyes locked on \nthe mangled mess of broken limbs and shattered bone. \nIt was the carnie that went first, vaulting over the side of the coconut shy with \nan unexpected agility. Then it was as if a dam had broken, and every half-\nwasted figure descended on the twisted corpse. Our interloper had to look \naway, or risk being sick at the sight of so many spindly bodies swarming, biting, \nrotten teeth and swollen gums tearing at the still-twitching body of the \nunfortunate soul from the roller coaster.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 3, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 3945}}
