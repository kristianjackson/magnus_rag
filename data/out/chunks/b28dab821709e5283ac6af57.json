Well, his “best” is us hiding from nightmares in a damp tunnel. \nGEORGIE \nIt’s not his fault. It’s… not like he wanted it to happen. \nMELANIE \nI know that, right! I know. I know, but the… the truth is, I just don’t like him. I \nnever have… and I’m sick of people acting like I should feel so super-\nsympathetic towards him, just because he’s had a rough time of it. I’ve had a \nrough time of it from the second I met him! We all have! And he doesn’t— \nGEORGIE \nOh, honey. I— \nMELANIE \nOkay. I can still hate him, even if I don’t, y’know, blame him but… \n(Melanie exhales frustratedly) \nGEORGIE \nYou know, you’re actually quite similar. \nMELANIE \nWell then at least I hate consistently. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 191 – What We Lose \n \n29 \nGEORGIE \nYou should really talk to Laverne about that. \nMELANIE \nOh trust me, it came up. Day one I think. \n(Sound of understanding from Georgie) \nBut all that said, we should still help them. \nGEORGIE \nWhat could we even do for them if John’s some kind of… all-knowing \ndemigod? \nMELANIE \nNot down there. Martin says they can’t find a way up into the Institute. \nGEORGIE \nToo risky. I told you about the things down near the stairs, right? \nMELANIE \nOh, ah, yeah. \nGEORGIE \nWe can’t afford to attract their attention. \nMELANIE \nYou’re doing it again. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 191 – What We Lose \n \n30 \nGEORGIE \n(Frustrated) Argh. \nMELANIE \nLook, you-you’ve been doing so much better recently. I, I know it’s really hard \nto judge risk without a, a sense of fear— \nGEORGIE \nBut I’m still overcompensating. \nMELANIE \nWell, I mean, not, not necessarily. It is dangerous. But... I, I don’t see another \nway out of this. An-And I don’t intend to spend the rest of eternity sleeping in a \ntunnel playing ‘mystery tin’. \nGEORGIE \nNot even if it was just the two of us? \nMELANIE \nOh, okay. Yes, well... maybe… I, I could handle that for a bit. But if there’s even \na small chance we could put things back... \nGEORGIE \nYou’re right. I know you’re right. I just hate getting involved. \nMELANIE \nWe’ve always been involved, right? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 191 – What We Lose \n \n31 \nGEORGIE \nYeah. \nMELANIE \nA-A-At least now it’s on our terms. This way you can get back to podcasting \nabout monsters— \n(A small chuckle from Georgie) \n—rather than hiding from them. \nGEORGIE \n(Sigh) Urgh, don’t. I was just thinking about that yesterday. How much I \nlegitimately miss those shitty ad reads. You know, everything happened just as \nI was recording one? \nMELANIE \nOh god, yeah! Um, what was it, uh— \nGEORGIE \n(Podcaster voice) “Slaughterville: The Town of a Thousand Corpses.” \nMELANIE \n(Happily) Yes! (chuckles) \nGEORGIE \nSome god-awful true crime thing based in a, a Colorado town where there \nwere meant to be, like, three serial killers or something. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 191 – What We Lose \n \n32 \nMELANIE \nJesus. \nGEORGIE \nI was so proud of the script I did for it as well! Thought I’d really nailed that \nschlocky pulp vibe without it being super obvious that I was making fun of \nthem. \nMELANIE \nMaybe you could do a rendition for the others. \nGEORGIE \nNot sure how well that would sit alongside Arun’s latest hymn. \n(Exaggerated sound of despair from Melanie) \nMELANIE \nCome on, we’d better head back. It’s probably not a great idea leaving that lot \nwith John and Martin unsupervised. \n[Melanie unfolds her cane as they get up to leave] \nGEORGIE \nYeah. \nMELANIE \nSo... we help them.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 5, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 3443}}
