The other \nthings, the... they are... too much, too much. There’s too many and they want \nto hurt me, so... So you leave the place, leave the place and the now. No place \nis forever. You know how to move, so do it. Pick a where, then... then move. \nGood! Then... then keep moving. Keep moving until you find another place, a \nplace you know. Just keep moving... keep moving. \n \n(The music swells) \n \n(Musical swell fades) \n \n(The Archivist staggers from the dance, exhausted) \n \nNIKOLA \nDo you feel it, Archivist? It’s almost there. A new day... \n \nGERTRUDE (NIKOLA) \nA terrible new world. And it’s all your fault. \n \nLEITNER (NIKOLA) \nThough I suppose you never really had a chance. \n \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG119 – Stranger and Stranger \n \n20 \n \nARCHIVIST \n(Quietly) I see you. \n \nNIKOLA \nDo you now? \n \nARCHIVIST \nYes. Yes, I see the sad clown, bitter and hateful. I see him finding his way to a \ncircus where nobody knew him. I see him torn apart, becoming the mask, \nremade by a cruel ringmaster. Sometimes a doll, sometimes a mannequin, \nalways hiding in somebody else’s skin, somebody else’s name. \n \nNIKOLA \nNot always. And it’s far too late for any of that. Nothing you see can help you. \n \nSARAH \nNot without the detonator. \n \nNIKOLA \nReally, Archivist? After all this preparation, all your research, all this \nmagnificent grotesquery... and you were just going to, what, blow it up? \n \nSARAH \nProbably the Hunter’s idea. She killed one of the Couriers. \n \nNIKOLA \n(Not sad) Oh dear, how sad. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG119 – Stranger and Stranger \n \n21 \n \n \nSARAH \nShe was also the one that damaged this shell. \n \nNIKOLA \nYou have hundreds of shells, “Sarah”, and soon you will have tens of \nthousands. You can have your little lures in every dark corner of the whole \nworld. \n \nSARAH \nNot until you finish the dance. \n \nNIKOLA \nOh, just let me enjoy myself for a moment! This is a once-in-eternity event, \nafter all. \n \nSARAH \nThis in-between is not as comfortable for all of us as it is for you. \n \nNIKOLA \nOh fine. Archivist, it’s been a pleasure, but I really must be— \n \n(Tim runs in, screaming in rage) \n \nTIM \nArghh! \n \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG119 – Stranger and Stranger \n \n22 \n \n(Tim tackles Sarah, knocking the detonator from her hand. It clatters to the \nfloor, and he picks it up) \n \nARCHIVIST \nWait, no! \n \n(Tim slaps the Archivist across the face) \n \nTIM \nI’ll kill you! All of you! \n \nSARAH \nWill you now? \n \nNIKOLA \n(Laughing) No, let them fight. It’s adorable... \n \n(Tim kicks the Archivist in the ribs) \n \nARCHIVIST \n(Desperate) Tim! What do you see? \n \nTIM \n(Immediately) I see my asshole boss. Oh, wait, wait... \n \nNIKOLA \nSpoilsport. Tim— \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG119 – Stranger and Stranger \n \n23 \n \n \nTIM \nGrimaldi... \n \nNIKOLA \nOnce. A long time ago. Before Orsinov made me. And sometimes even now, for \nspecial occasions. Like your brother. [Distorted, deeper voice] Shall I? \n \n \nARCHIVIST \n(Desperate) Tim, what’s in your hand? \n \nTIM \nIt’s... I don’t... The, the... the detonator. \n \nNIKOLA \nThat’s quite enough from you, I think. \n \n(There is a sudden spike in the music, The Archivist cries out and collapses) \n \nNIKOLA \nAnd now you. \n \nTIM \nGo on. I’ll race you. See if you can do it again before I can squeeze. \n \nSARAH \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG119 – Stranger and Stranger \n \n24 \n \nIt’s too late. \n \nNIKOLA \nThe world is ours. That toy won’t help you now. \n \nTIM \nSo come and take it. \n \n… \n \nThat’s what I thought. \n \nNIKOLA \nI am losing my patience! \n \nTIM \nBack! Get back! That’s right... (Pause) John, I don’t know if you can hear me, \nbut if you can— \n \nARCHIVIST \nTim... \n \nTIM \n—I don’t forgive you, but thank you for this. \n \nSARAH \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG119 – Stranger and Stranger \n \n25 \n \nYou idiot. Do you really think the world will fare any better under the Watcher? \nYou think you’re saving anyone? \n \nTIM \nI don’t care. \n \nNIKOLA \nYou can’t even save him— \n \nTIM \nBut I can hurt you. \n \nNIKOLA \nIt will not end like this! \n \nTIM \n(Bitterly) You sound stressed. You know, I hear the great clown Grimaldi is in \ntown. You should go see him. Cheer yourself up. \n \nNIKOLA \nThat’s. Not. Funny. \n \nTIM \nI know. \n \n(Tim squeezes the detonator and there’s a loud boom)", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 3, "chunk_count": 5, "chars": 4245}}
