This leaves those \nof us who work in waste collection seeing kind of a strange side to humanity, \nbut an honest one at that. If you’re a bit of a boozer, there’s every chance that \nyour bin men know how much you drink better than you do because we empty \nall the bottles. And yes, we do remember, and we also get quite judgemental \nat times, although not about the things you might think – you can throw away \na mountain of grotesque porn and, as long as you’ve tied it into neat bundles, \nwe’re fine with it, but if you throw away cat litter without properly bagging \nthat, you’d better believe that you’ve earned the hatred of every bin man that \never slung a sack. Still, I’m getting off topic. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG005 – Thrown Away \n3 \n \nPoint is, the bag of dolls heads didn’t bother me. I mean, it was freaky, don’t \nget me wrong – hundreds of small plastic heads, staring out of the refuse sack \nat me, but aside from a slight rip on the side of the black bag, they were \nthrown away very neatly, and were easy enough to toss into the truck. The bag \nwas full of them, mind. It was placed next to the green recycling bin and at first \nI thought that it was just a single doll with its head positioned near the tear, \nbut when I tossed the bag into the truck the rip split, spilling forth a whole \nbunch of the things. At a guess I’d say there were over a hundred in there. \nThey were made of hard, rigid plastic with that infant doll face that you seem \nto find on every toy like that. Several of them had different hair moulded or \npainted on, so it was clear that they weren’t simply from a hundred or so of \nthe same doll. Someone had spent time acquiring a whole variety of different \ndolls, which they then beheaded and stuffed into the sack. They were very \nbattered, but not with age – it looked as though someone had taken the brand \nnew heads and dragged them over rough concrete, though I couldn’t say \nwhether they’d have been attached to the rest of the doll at the time. It was \ncreepy, sure, but the sun was shining and there were four of us working the \ntruck that day, so it was easy enough to laugh it off. It was the old crew – me, \nDavid Atayah, Matthew Wilkinson, and Alan Parfitt, who drives - drove - the \ntruck. \nWhat it did do, though, was mark out 93 Lancaster Road in our minds as “the \nDoll House”, since we spent the rest of the day making off-colour jokes about \nthe sort of people who must live there. I said before that your bin man knows a \nlot about you. Now that’s probably not actually true for most people – we \nservice hundreds of homes each day and who can keep track of that many \npeople? Who wants to? You do have houses, though, that you learn to keep an \neye on; the sort of places that throw out strange or sometimes even dangerous", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 1, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 2790}}
