I went over there, you know. Went to \nconfront that old… and you know what happened? She let me in. She was, \nnice, civil. Offered me another cup of coffee! I told her where to stick it. \nDemanded, asked, begged her to stop whatever was happening to me. You \nknow what she did? She shrugged. She just shrugged! Told me that “Some \nhungers are too strong to be denied”, whatever the hell that means. So I went \nfor her. I was going to strangle the life out of that curse-flinging bag of bones. \nBut as I reached for her, I... I don’t know. I don’t know what happened. I know \nthat that’s how I lost the hand. I know I chewed it off. \nLook it doesn’t matter. I just need your help. I need this to stop. I don’t know \nhow, but this is your area, right? This is what you do. You look into this weird \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG014 – Piecemeal \n11 \n \nghost crap, right? Well this is the definition of weird ghost crap, and I need you \nto help me. I need you to save me from whatever is happening. \nI don’t have much time. I got a box this morning, a few hours before I came \nhere. It was a tongue. \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nStatement ends. \nIt doesn’t look like this case was ever properly followed up. According to the \nsupplementary notes, shortly after making his statement, Mr Rentoul became \nviolent towards Institute staff and in the ensuing incident there was… an \naccident. No details are given, but it apparently required Mr Rentoul’s \nhospitalisation. I’m reminded of a somewhat tasteless joke about loose \ntongues. He did not return to the Institute afterwards, and his statement was \narchived. \nAccording to the arrest records Sasha uncovered, Mr Rentoul was telling the \ntruth about the somewhat chequered past of himself and his associate Paul \nNoriega, with extensive files on both of them. The last listed interaction \nbetween the police and Mr Noriega is two months before Mr Rentoul’s \nstatement, and since then no sign can be found of him in police records, or \nindeed anywhere else. I sent Martin to look into this ‘Angela’ character, not \nthat I want him to get chopped up, of course, but someone had to. Apparently \nhe spent three days looking into every woman named Angela in Bexley over \nthe age of 50. He could not find anyone that matches the admittedly vague \ndescription given here, though he informs me that he had some very pleasant \nchats about jigsaws. Useless ass. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG014 – Piecemeal \n12 \n \nTim has done his best to try and hunt down Mr Rentoul and see if we can \ncontact him for a follow-up interview or evaluation, but it looks like he \ndisappeared shortly after making this statement. We were able to find his old \nlandlord, though, who said that Mr Rentoul vanished in early April of 2011, \nleaving many unpaid bills and no forwarding address. He said that when he had \ngone to clear out the flat, he had been surprised to find there was no furniture \nleft. All that remained in the house, he said, were hundreds and hundreds of \nsmall cardboard boxes. \nRecording Ends. \n[The Magnus Archives Theme - Outro] \n \nThe Magnus Archives is a podcast distributed by Rusty Quill and licensed under \na creative commons attribution, non-commercial share alike 4.0 international \nlicense.
