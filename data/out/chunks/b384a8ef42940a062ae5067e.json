Been almost 50 years I’ve been meaning to pay you people a visit \nand get this down on paper, but I finally got here. So where to start? My name \nis Trevor Herbert, like I put at the top of your form there, and I’ve been \nhomeless for most of my life. In fact if you lived in Manchester there’s a good \nchance you’d have heard of me. They call me “Trevor the Tramp”. I mean, I’m \nnot exactly easy to miss am I, and I’ve been living there in public view for so \nlong I guess I’ve become kind of an institution. Helps that I’ve always had a \nkind of uncanny knack for guessing people’s ages. People will come up to me \non the street and ask me to guess their age, and I’ll tell them and most of the \ntime they’ll be shocked when I get it right. It’s fun. So everyone around \nManchester knows about Trevor the Tramp, sure. I hear someone even made \nme a page on the Internet and it got a few thousand likes. I don’t know exactly \nwhat that means but it sounds nice. Obviously that’s not why I’m here, though, \nis it? No, I’m here because I have also dedicated my life to finding and killing \nvampires. \nI have killed five people that I know for sure as vampires, and there are two \nmore that may or may not have been. There is one man I have killed, \nunfortunately, who I am now sure was human, but I also know he was a violent \ncriminal so I try not to feel too badly about that. I’m sure it’s hard to accept for \nanyone, even an organisation such as yourselves, but I do not have proof to \ngive you except for the vampire teeth that I will leave with this statement. Do \nnot feel bad about reporting me to the police for the murders, as I am sure you \nmust, since I have recently received a diagnosis of late-stage lung cancer and it \nis doubtful I will be living much longer anyway. That is the main reason for \nfinally putting down on paper the details of the mission I have been secretly \nundertaking for the last half a century.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 0, "chunk_count": 10, "chars": 2864}}
