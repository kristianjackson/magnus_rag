It’s okay, she has some \nbandages. I’m so lucky she’s here. \n[Bandaging sounds] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nShe bandages my arm, and it starts to bleed even more. Something’s wrong \nhere. There’s something behind her smile. I look away. \n[Buzzing stops; hotel room sounds resume] \nARCHIVIST \nThe dull blue paint of the staircase is gone but... I recognise the wallpaper... \nWhere have I seen this wallpaper before? \nHELEN \nNowhere special. \nARCHIVIST \nThe corridor? I’m— No, we were on the stairs. Did we leave? No this isn’t right, \nit isn’t fair. I’ve got to— Wait, where is she? She was lying. Was she? She led \nme here, but now she’s gone and I’m… I’m so tired. When did I sleep last? No, \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 187 – Checking Out \n \n20 \nI-I can’t sleep, I’ve got to find my son. Just keep moving, there’s only so many \nrooms. \n[Door knocking and rattling restarts] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nHe has to be in one of them. Just push on, even if you have to check them all. \nIgnore the blood you’re dripping on the carpet. Ignore the mirrors that try to \ntell you how haggard you’re growing. Ignore the laughter and the smiling and \nthe chatter that has followed you since the reception. When did you go to \nreception? You can’t picture it. \nHELEN \nShame, it’s very tasteful. There’s ferns. \n[Hissing static starts] \nARCHIVIST \nWait. What is that? That sound. It’s… It’s not her, not just her. There’s \nsomeone else. A man’s voice, you think. Droning on, and rising and falling as he \ntalks and talks and talks... \nHELEN \nAh… Ah. \nARCHIVIST \nUp there, just around the corner. I can hear them. I can hear them. There! \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 187 – Checking Out \n \n21 \nGUEST \nOh, oh thank god! Pl-please, do you know where room 288 is? I... My son, he’s \nI don’t know how long he’s been in there on his own, and I need to find him— \n[Hissing static ends] \nARCHIVIST \nLook, I’m so sorry. But… there is no room 288. \nGUEST \nBut my son! \n[A door opens and Helen manifests as a person] \n[A high-pitched tone starts] \n(Disgusted sigh from the Archivist) \nHELEN \n(Smilingly) —Is around here somewhere. Come on, let’s have a look together. \nGUEST \nOh brilliant, oh thank you, thank you so much! \nHELEN \nNow, where did you see him last? \nGUEST \nUh, okay. It was… it was room... wait, wait hang on. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 187 – Checking Out \n \n22 \nARCHIVIST \nShe’s lying to you, she isn’t your friend. \nGUEST \nI... wait. I, I know you. You’re that woman from reception. \nHELEN \nJohn, this isn’t your business. \nGUEST \nYou were laughing! You were laughing when I got lost. \nHELEN \nListen John, I don’t come up and tell you how to pull horror from people’s \nbrains, do I? \n[The Guest is talked over as Helen and the Archivist argue] \nGUEST \nPlease, please, I need… I need some directions. \nARCHIVIST \nYou do a bit, actually, yes. \nGUEST \nThis place, it’s such a maze... \nHELEN \nWell, okay, that’s… that’s fair. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 187 – Checking Out \n \n23 \nGUEST \nI don’t know how long I’ve been here. \nARCHIVIST \n(Crosstalk) (sympathetically to the guest) Look. I’m so sorry, but— \nGUEST \n(Crosstalk) You’ve got to help me! \nARCHIVIST \n(Angrily) Don’t touch me! \n[The Archivist pushes the Guest away; there as a bang as she falls \nto the floor, crying] \nHELEN \nOopsie. Not so easy, is it? Keeping up your humanity? \nGUEST \n(Pleadingly) I’m sorry… It’s just my son... \nARCHIVIST \nI could make her an avatar. \nHELEN \nHuh... Hmmm. \n[Wood creaks as the building rearranges herself] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 187 – Checking Out \n \n24 \nHELEN (CONT’D) \nBest not. \n(Crying from the Guest, then a last exhalation) \n[A door slams; both manifested Helen and the Guest have gone] \n[The high-pitched tone ends] \nARCHIVIST \nSending her away? I must have hit a nerve. \n[Helen’s voice returns to being part of the building] \nHELEN \nGot on my nerves. Not the same thing. \nARCHIVIST \nIf you say so. \n(Beat) \nHELEN \nSo, what happens now? \nARCHIVIST \nYou mean, did the sight of a poor, innocent wretch suffering by your hand \nconvince me that you need to be destroyed? \nHELEN \nPretty much.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 4, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 4084}}
