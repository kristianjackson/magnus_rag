Deep beneath my skin, where the bone sits, enshrined in \nflesh, I feel it. Something, not moving but that wants to move. Wants to be \nfree. It itches, and I don’t think I want it. I don’t know what to do. \nYou can’t help me. I don’t think so, at least. But whatever it is that calls to me, \nthat wants me for its own, it hates you. It hates what you are and what you do. \nAnd if it hates you, then maybe you can help me. If I wanted to be helped. I \ndon’t know if I do. You must understand, it sings so sweetly, and I need it, but I \nam afraid. It isn’t right and I need help. I need it to be seen. To be seen in the \ncold light of knowledge is anathema to the things that crawl and slither and \nswarm in the corners and the cracks. In the pitted holes of the hive. \nYou can’t see it, of course. It isn’t real. Not like you or I are real. It’s more of an \neverywhere. A feeling. Are you familiar with trypophobia? That disgusted fear \nat holes, irregular, honeycombed holes. Makes you feel that itch in the back of \nyour mind, like the holes are there too, in your own brain, rotten and hollow \nand swarming. Is that real? \nI’m sorry, I know I’m meant to be telling you what happened. What brought \nme to this place. This place of books and learning, of sight and beholding. I’m \nsorry. I should. I will. \nI… I haven’t slept in some time. I can’t sleep. My dreams are crawling and \nmany-legged. Not just slithering and burrowing,. though it is the burrowing \nthat draws me. They always sing that song of flesh. I hope you will forgive me \nfor such a rambling story. I hope you will forgive me for a great many things, as \nit may be I do worse. I have that feeling, that instinct that squirms through \nyour belly. There will be great violence done here. And I bleed into that \nviolence.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 0, "chunk_count": 5, "chars": 2703}}
