I mean, sure, that far north it gets dark for a long time, \nbut there’s also really long days in the summer. \nARCHIVIST \nOkay. \nBASIRA \nBut I think... Have you got a pen? \nARCHIVIST \nUh, yeah, i-in the drawer. \n[Drawer opens] \nBASIRA \nUh... John. What’s this? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 140 – The Movement of the Heavens \n \n14 \n \nARCHIVIST \nHmm? Oh! \nThat’s... uh, th— uh, that’s my rib. \nBASIRA \n… \nRight. \nARCHIVIST \nYup. \nBASIRA \nAnd the jar of ashes? \nARCHIVIST \nNot, not mine. I mean, it belongs to me, I-I guess, but it’s not— Stationery is in \nthe other drawer. \n[Another drawer opens, pens rattle] \nBASIRA \nRight. Thanks. \nOkay. \n[Paper rustles] \nNow, look here. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 140 – The Movement of the Heavens \n \n15 \n \nARCHIVIST \nRight. I— Yes, I, I know where it is. \nBASIRA \nI don’t think Ny-Ålesund is the ritual location. \nARCHIVIST \nRight. \nBASIRA \nI think it’s a… a staging ground. \nARCHIVIST \nFor what? \nBASIRA \nThe darkest place on the surface on the Earth - the North Pole during the \nwinter solstice. \nARCHIVIST \nI hope you’re not suggesting that Santa works for the People’s Church? \nBASIRA \nJohn. It’s eleven weeks of pitch black night, as far from the sun as you can get \non the planet. \nARCHIVIST \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 140 – The Movement of the Heavens \n \n16 \n \nAlright. So why haven’t they done it already? \nBASIRA \nI think they were waiting for Rayner to get his new body. But my sources tell \nme now that they’re gearing up for something. \nARCHIVIST \nThese “sources”, are they the same ones that sent you to the Australian \noutback while I was burying myself alive? \nBASIRA \nTheir info is normally good. \nARCHIVIST \nHmmm. \nBASIRA \nThere is one more thing that might convince you. \nARCHIVIST \nThey have an eldritch ball of some sort of manifested dark matter that’s going \nto be the focus of the ritual? \nBASIRA \nI thought you said you couldn’t Know things about them? \nARCHIVIST \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 140 – The Movement of the Heavens \n \n17 \n \nI can still read. Actually, you should probably see that statem— You know \nwhat. No, later. \n(Sighs) So what’s the plan? \nBASIRA \nI’m getting us passage on a boat heading up there. \nARCHIVIST \nRight. \nBASIRA \nI bring all the guns from Daisy’s old stash, you bring the spook you used to \nmess up that delivery guy. \nARCHIVIST \nWhat? That’s it? Christ, I thought my plans were half-arsed. \nBASIRA \nIt’s all about when we go. \nARCHIVIST \nI don’t follow. \nBASIRA \nSummer solstice is the 21st of June. So we leave in a fortnight. Should arrive \nabout a week before. No danger of sunset or darkness for a long time. Stands \nto reason, that they’ll be at their weakest. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 140 – The Movement of the Heavens \n \n18 \n \nARCHIVIST \nI don’t know. Is Daisy coming? \nBASIRA \nNo. \nARCHIVIST \nOh. I… I-I just thought— \nBASIRA \nWe’ve talked about it. If The Hunt takes her again... we don’t know if she’s \ncoming back, and neither of us want that. \nARCHIVIST \nO-O-Of course. And I, I don’t imagine Melanie would be keen to come. \nBASIRA \nShe wasn’t. \nARCHIVIST \nWhy am I always the last to know about these things? \nBASIRA \nBy this point, I just assume the eyeball tells you. \nARCHIVIST \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 140 – The Movement of the Heavens \n \n19 \n \nThat would imply it tells me anything useful. But no, I’m stuck knowing how \nyour year 8 PE teacher died. \nBASIRA \nMiss Peterson? \nARCHIVIST \nPancreatic cancer, if you’re interested. \nBASIRA \nI... wasn’t? \nARCHIVIST \nNo. No, o-o-of course not. \nAlright, so just me and you, then? I don’t suppose you could get some of the \nteam that helped you take Rayner down last time? \nBASIRA \n(Sarcastic) Oh yeah, sure. I’ll just drop them a message. You know, we’ve \nactually got a group chat going called “British cops who love to do extrajudicial \nspook killings on foreign soil.” I’ll just see if they’re free Saturday. \nARCHIVIST \nYes, yes! Alright, alright. \nYou’re sure about this? \nBASIRA", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 4, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 3954}}
