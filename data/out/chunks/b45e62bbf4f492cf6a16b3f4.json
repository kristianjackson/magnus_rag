She didn’t \nhave any assistants, so there were no witnesses, and no-one \nsaw or heard anything. The police tested the blood and \nconfirmed the DNA matched to Gertrude, though I don’t know \nwhy they had her on file. They judged there to be almost a \ngallon of blood spilled, far more than the human body can lose \nand survive, so I assumed she was dead and left the \ninvestigation to the police, for all that good it did me. And I \nappointed another archivist. \n \nMartin finding her body in the tunnels is as much a mystery to me \nas it is to you. \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nRight. Right. Thank you, Elias. \nStatement ends. \n \n \nCan you send in Tim? \n \n \n[CLICK] \n \n \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG040 – Human Remains \n8 \n \n[CLICK] \n \n \nTIM \n[Tired] Do you need much? I’d really like to go home. \n \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nI sympathise. It won’t take more than a few minutes. I just… I \nneed the parts that weren’t on tape at the time. \n \nTIM \nSure. Just… quarantine, y’know? Not as much fun as it sounds. \n \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nYou were certainly in there longer than I was. Everything alright? \n \n \n \nTIM \nYeah, I just made some joke about itching and suddenly they were \ndoing a whole bunch more tests. \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nWell, itching is one of \n \nTIM \nI know! I know. I was trying to lighten the mood. I’m fine, though. \nExcept for the holes. And the pain. And the blood and the \nnightmares. Could’ve been worse though, eh? Another couple of \nminutes and… \n \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG040 – Human Remains \n9 \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nYes. Yes. It was... Anyway, statement of Timothy Stoker, archival \nassistant at the Magnus Institute, regarding the infestation by the \nentity formerly known as Jane Prentiss. Statement recorded direct \nfrom subject, 29th July 2016. Just take it from when you got back \nfrom lunch. \n \nTIM \nWell, I could tell something was wrong as soon as I got back. It was \nquiet. I mean, it’s normally quiet, but it was dead quiet. I spotted the \ntape recorder lying on the ground, and went over to, er, see if it was \ndamaged, and as I was checking it I heard Sasha shouting. It’s a bit \nof blur, to be honest, ‘cause when I turned around, there she was. \nPrentiss. Her face so full of holes it’s like, “my eyes are up here”, \nbut they’re not, you know? They’re just... She tried to say \nsomething, but I don’t know, I couldn’t really understand her \nthrough all the... \nSo, I could see the worms were coming through the floor, the walls, \neverywhere. Th3 whole “we’re safe inside the Archive thing”? Not \nso much. I don’t know what I was going to do, I think I was going to \ntry and hit her, but that’s when Sasha knocked me to the floor. It, it \nwas a good move, actually. Prentiss didn’t seem to expect it, and \nwe crushed a lot of worms when we fell. They were slow to react, \nand we were running before they really went for us. I mean, all this \nhappened in the space of a few seconds, so I’m not exactly certain. \nSasha had to basically drag me behind her. I saw the shelf in front \nof us was about to topple. There were so many worms on it so, \nbeing the hero I am, I let go of her hand and told her to get help. \nShe made it out the main door. I turned to run into the office.
