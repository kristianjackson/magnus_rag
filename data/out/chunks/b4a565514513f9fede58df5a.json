There was nothing left of my dad, save a charred \nshadow on the wall, scorched through the plaster and into the now exposed \nbrick. All that was left of Mrs Whitshaw was powdered bone. \nThere are terrible things coming, things that if we knew of them would leave us \nweak and trembling with shuddering terror at the knowledge that they are \ncoming for all of us. We all made them, and their course is already plotted. You \ncan see them in the numbers, if you only learn how to read them. \nStatement ends. \n(Martin clears his throat and takes a deep breath) \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 144 – Decrypted \n \n9 \n \nMARTIN \nRight. Another statement, another side to Peter’s “Extinction”, I think. I, uh, I \ncouldn’t follow some of his reasoning, but I think it was about nuclear \nweapons, or maybe- doomsday weapons? In keeping with the theme, I \nsuppose. (Articulating clearly, in case Peter’s there) I just wish Peter would \nspend less time trying to convince me his new power is real and more time \ntelling me what he plans to do about it. [Normal again] And where I fit in. I \nmean, fine, I guess I believe— \n[Knock at the door. Another knock.] \nCome in. \n[Door opens] \nDAISY \nMind if I join you? \n… \nThey’re back. Thought you might want to know. \n… \nSeems like it went smooth. Too smooth for Basira, it sounds like. Keeps looking \nat John like she can’t believe he made it back. \n… \nI, uh, I mentioned our conversation to him. He asked me to check on— \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 144 – Decrypted \n \n10 \n \nMARTIN \n(Quietly) Just leave. \nDAISY \nSorry? \nMARTIN \nGet out. \nDAISY \nOh. Right. Sorry, I didn’t... \nMARTIN \n(Snapping) It’s not difficult. Just get out. \nDAISY \n(Hurt) Fine. \n(Angry) Fine. Just thought— \nMARTIN \nNo, no you didn’t. We’re not friends, Daisy. None of us are. We’re all just \ntrapped together here and kidding ourselves that we don’t hate it. Christ, there \nare more important things than feelings right now, so just leave me alone. For \ngood. \nDAISY \nRight. You got it. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 144 – Decrypted \n \n11 \n \n[Door closes] \n(Martin sighs.) \nMARTIN \nWell? \n[Static rises] \nPETER \nI’m impressed. And grateful. \nMARTIN \nI didn’t do it for you. \nPETER \nEven better. \nMARTIN \nEasier this way. I’m sure you’d have had no problem sending her away. \nPETER \nI hadn’t really thought about it, and now, thanks to you, I don’t need to. \nMARTIN \nYeah, well. It seems to be your 'go-to’ move for dealing with anyone. \nPETER \nI’m just not big on confrontation. You understand, I’m sure. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 144 – Decrypted \n \n12 \n \nMARTIN \nWe are not the same. \nPETER \nOf course. \nMARTIN \nSo, what now? \nPETER \nDid you read it? \nMARTIN \nYeah. \nPETER \nAnd? \nMARTIN \nI believe you. \nPETER \nYou don’t still think I’m trying to trick you into a grand ritual? \nMARTIN \nI mean, I’m not about to start chanting stuff for you, but... the details you’ve \ngiven me all seem to check out. So far. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 144 – Decrypted \n \n13 \n \nPETER \nGood. \nMARTIN \nSo, what’s our next step? \nPETER \nFor you, keep researching. I’m sure we haven’t found all the statements in \nhere that deal with The Extinction yet. One of the downsides of not serving the \nCeaseless Watcher is that we have to actually look things up, not to mention \nthe fact that Gertrude was distressingly good at obfuscation. The more you \nknow about our enemy, the better. \nMARTIN \nAnd you? \nPETER \nI have my own explorations I need to attend to. And a, um, meeting to arrange. \nFor you. \nMARTIN \nFor me? \nPETER \nI’m absolutely delighted with your progress, and I feel you’ve earned some \nstraight answers. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 144 – Decrypted \n \n14 \n \nMARTIN \nBut not from you? \nPETER \nOh no, that sort of conversation makes me very uncomfortable. No, I’m owed a \nfavour by a friend of mine. I’ve asked him to stop by when he’s back in the \ncountry. \nMARTIN \nYou’re not just going to tell me, maybe? \nPETER \nWhen have I ever? \n(Martin sighs in irritation.) \nPETER (Cont.) \nOh, come now. What would life be without the occasional twist? Oh, speaking \nof which, I’ve had a report of a workplace dispute in the Library, and I would \nvalue your input. I’m trying to get out of the habit of, what did you call it, \n“sending them away?” \nMARTIN \n(Sighs) Fine. \n[Tape clicks off.]", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 4, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 4393}}
