Would you explain to him that you’re \nhere of your own free will? \nMARTIN \nI mean, that’s a pretty generous way to describe being blackmailed. \nANNABELLE \nOh, it’s blackmail, is it? Offering you a way out of all this? \nMARTIN \nYou said if I told John or waited then you’d leave, and I’d never know. \nANNABELLE \nAnd you believed me, which was very gracious of you. \nMARTIN \n(Sputters slightly) I shouldn’t have. \nANNABELLE \nWhy not? I didn’t lie to you, I do have another option for you. One that means \nneither of you need to die or be consumed by any dark power. \nMARTIN \nOh, but you can’t just tell me or John. Oh no, no, that would be far too \nstraightforward. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 196 – This Old House \n \n7 \nANNABELLE \nI could. \n(Martin sighs) \nBut it’s much better if you see it for yourselves. And he would not have come \nwillingly. He needs to think he’s coming for you. \nMARTIN \nHe can see literally everything, I’m sure he probably knows it already. \nANNABELLE \nIn a way, perhaps. But I guarantee that being here in person is something very \ndifferent. \nCome on. \nMARTIN \nHey, is that—? You told me not to bring a tape recorder. \nANNABELLE \nNo. I said we wouldn’t need one. We have plenty of tapes. \nMARTIN \n(Crosstalk) But then— \nANNABELLE \n(Crosstalk) We’re here. \n[Footsteps cease] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 196 – This Old House \n \n8 \nMARTIN \nThis is it? \nANNABELLE \nAh, I forget. You’ve never actually been here before, have you? \nWell? What do you think? \nMARTIN \nIt’s... I-I mean, it’s, um… \nANNABELLE \nJust a house? \nMARTIN \nWell… well, yeah. \nANNABELLE \nWhat were you expecting? \nMARTIN \nI don’t know, like... something a bit more dramatic, I guess. \nANNABELLE \nWe’ll… see what we can do. \n[Footsteps, then Annabelle opens the door] \n(Dramatically) Step into my parlour. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 196 – This Old House \n \n9 \nMARTIN \nHmmm. \nFine. \n[Footsteps as Martin follows, changing from pavement to wood] \n[Door closes behind him] \nANNABELLE \nDo take a seat. \n[Martin puts down his backpack and takes a seat] \nMARTIN \n(Warily) So… What now? \nANNABELLE \nI’ve written you a statement. I would like for you to read it. \n[Paper rustling and footsteps as Annabelle passes the statement \nto Martin] \nMARTIN \nAnd if I don’t? \nANNABELLE \nThen we sit here in silence until the Archivist arrives. But I would suggest you \ndo read it. I believe you’ll find it... illuminating. \n[She sits] \n(A long beat before Martin sighs heavily) \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 196 – This Old House \n \n10 \nMARTIN \nScrew it. Fine! Fine. \n[Throughout the reading there is the occasional rustling of paper \nfrom Martin, wood creak from the building settling, and distant \ntweets of birds outside] \nMARTIN \nOnce there was a house, a building that for all it might have looked like those \naround it, was not the same. \nStop, no. \nIt didn’t start with the house. It was here long before any might have thought \nof it as a home. \nOnce, there was a patch of land, not quite as firm in this reality as that which \nsurrounded it. \nStop, no. \nIt’s not about the land. Mud and soil has no part in what is there. \nOnce, there was a point in space that did not quite obey all those petty rules \nthat decide what can be allowed to happen in a world. \nStop, no. \nIt’s not a point in space. The Earth spins and hurtles through the darkness, but \nit still carries it along. \nLet us simply say that once there was a place.
