You \nsee, Jonah, I feel the hour of my death approaching and, though you have \nalways been reluctant to pay due heed to my warnings or counsel, I continue \nto see in you the reflection of my own past hubris. I could not go easy to my \ngrave without offering you one last plea for your restraint. What we built at \nMillbank should be left well enough alone, resigned to the nightmares of the \nreprobates and brigands contained within its walls. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 138 – The Architecture of Fear \n \n7 \n \nI have been blessed with a long life, something few who cross paths with the \nDread Powers can boast, but now, at the end of it, my true fear is that I have \nwasted it chasing an impossible dream. To speak plain, I have begun to lose \nfaith in the possibility of balance, of any sort of equilibrium among them. It is \ntelling that of those I have brought into my confidence, it is only you and I who \nhave continued this far without falling to one Power or another, despite all my \ninstruction and work. This is, of course, assuming you have not taken the path \nof The Eye that I know has called you, called us both, for so long. Even since \nbefore we began our work on Millbank. \nI suppose I had to believe that the darker natures of our terror could be kept in \ncheck, weighed against each other, so that the Great Wheel would keep \nturning forever without reaching the velocity I feared would crush us. Perhaps \nmy sin was to see them as something that could be knowable, and harnessed. \nI’m sure you recall what happened with the Reform Club, but you may be \nunaware of some of my other experiments below the very streets of London. \nPlaces I have tried to cover with churches of all things, in the faint hope that \nperhaps the sight of Our Saviour will be enough to contain them. A rather \nfeeble hope for my own salvation. \nDid I ever tell you about the dreams? I’m sure I must have. I would dream \nabout them, you see, as a young man. Long before I devised my taxonomy. I \nwould find myself in nightmares of strange far-off places: a field of graves, a \ngrasping tunnel, an abattoir knee deep in pigs’ blood. I believed then, as I still \nbelieve now, that these places I saw were the Powers themselves, expressed in \ntheir truest form, far more entirely than any secret book can claim. And if, as I \ncame to believe, the Dread Powers were themselves places of a sort, then \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 138 – The Architecture of Fear \n \n8 \n \nsurely with the right space, the right architecture, they could be contained. \nChannelled. Harnessed. \nSo yes, hubris. Not simply in that, I suppose, but in believing that those I \nbrought into my confidence shared my lofty goals. So many have abandoned \nus, casting about for rituals that I helped design. In my excited discussions with \nMr Rayner, I perhaps extrapolated too much from his talk of a grand ritual of \ndarkness. The Dark, I thought, was simply one of the Powers, so it stands to \nreason that each of them should have its own ritual. And perhaps they already \ndid even before I put pen to paper. But they certainly do now, and I shudder to \nthink how Lukas, Scott and the others may use this conception. Fourteen \npowers, with their opposites and their allies, each with an aim no more nor \nless than manifestation. Apocalypse. Apotheosis. I wonder, did my work bring \nabout these dreadful things, or did I simply develop the means by which they \ncan be known? \nI should have realised, of course, when first we discussed The Flesh. For how \ncan there be true balance, each one to its opposite, when new fears can \nemerge and change as civilisation grows and alters? When a new Power can \nbirth itself screaming from the torn remnants of others? I know you say the \nFlesh was perhaps always there, shrivelled and nascent until it’s recent growth, \nbut to grant the existence of such lesser powers would throw everything into \nconfusion. Would you have me separate the corruption between insects, dirt \nand disease? To divide the fungal bloom from the maggot? No. No, I stand by \nmy work. And thus we must conclude that the only explanation is a new \npower, created from what was once others, yet also distinct. And if such \nchange is possible, how then can any true balance be ach", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 1, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 4500}}
