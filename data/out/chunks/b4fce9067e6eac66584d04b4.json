I \nturned the torch on, and was pleased by how easily it penetrated the darkness, \nilluminating the rough, grey stone below. I was expecting my torch to be met \nby hundreds of decaying worm husks, but the passage seemed to be empty. I \nheaded down into the tunnel, closing the trapdoor behind me. \nIt is hard to put into words how it felt to be down there, in the cool, \nmouldering air of the tunnels. Have you ever left a crowded room, and literally \nfelt the silence as you walked out into the night? It was something like that, a \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG041 – Too Deep \n4 \n \nsudden, quiet absence. Not in itself a fearful thing, but unsettling in a way I \nhadn’t noticed through the fear and adrenaline of my first time in the tunnels. I \ntook a moment to examine the feeling, but couldn’t trace it anything obvious, \nso I began to explore. \nIt was almost unreal how quickly I became lost. I generally consider myself to \nhave an excellent sense of direction, but within minutes I became unsure of \nexactly which passages I had come from. I didn’t even have the excuse of the \ncorridors all looking the same, as they varied significantly in height and \nconstruction. Some were built of sturdy brick, some seemed almost as though \nthey had formed naturally, though in all cases it was the same dull, grey stone. \nTo call it a maze wouldn’t quite be accurate, as a maze is designed. It is set out \nwith an obvious goal, even if that goal is to confuse and disorientate. This \nplace, it felt more organic in its unpredictability, as though it had been \nintended to be used, to be travelled, but had gotten twisted somehow. I found \nspaces that seemed intended as rooms but without doors. Elsewhere, there \nwere doors that seemed simply attached to the walls. Most of these were \nfirmly shut, though some opened to reveal the flat grey stone behind. Only a \nhandful I opened had actual rooms behind them, and in every case I found \nmyself wondering whether that was where Martin had found her. \nThere was no way to tell. Even when the police finally found Gertrude’s body, \nthey took it, chair and all, as well as all the tapes. Evidence, they said, and they \nmight be right, though I don’t envy them the task of going through all of them. \nThere must have been hundreds. \nNo. I suppose in some way I do envy them. They are an insight into my \npredecessor’s time here; something I desperately want to know more about. \nWhatever’s on them, it must be important, because… either she chose to hide \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG041 – Too Deep \n5 \n \nthem down here, or whoever killed her did. Either way, I have a feeling it isn’t \nsomething the police are going to understand. I half-hoped to stumble across a \nlone cassette lying in one of the corridors, dropped or overlooked, but there \nwas nothing. Just dark and empty tunnels, silent and unwelcoming. \nI foolishly didn’t think to make a note of the time I entered the tunnels, so it \nwas hard to say how long I had been down there, or how far I had gone, when I \nfound the first of the worms, but it can’t have been more than a half hour. \nThey were long dead by then. Shrivelled, stringy things, like discarded sausage \ncasing, and it was odd to see how clear a line there was between the wormless \ntunnels and those where they still lay rotting. A clear line beyond which the \ncleaning crews had decided not to advance. When I crossed that line, I half-\nexpected the corpses to spring to life, turning their squirming heads towards \nme with a predatory lunge, but they were still. \nNonetheless, I went slower through those deeper passages, picking my footing \ncarefully so as not to touch them. The air was colder here, suffused with the \nfaint tang of rot, and I began to wonder how much battery I had in my torch. I \nhad put a fresh one in before my expedition, I’m not stupid, but the more I \nthought about it, the more I realised that I don’t actually know how long \nbatteries last for continuous use in a heavy-duty torch. I hadn’t even been \ndown there an hour, but already it felt like the light it cast was weaker, \nsomehow, and I realised how unsure I was of my exact route back. I decided I \nwould rather cut my first trip unnecessarily short than risk being trapped down \nthere without light. So I turned back. \nIt was almost impossible to retrace my steps.
