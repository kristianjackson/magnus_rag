Ice cream, beaches and boredom are all very \nwell, but I’m glad to hear Bournemouth has at least a few apparitions to call its \nown. That said, the fact is Mr Gillespie’s statement starts with drug use and \ncontinues on with the lack of corroborating witnesses being a central theme, \nwhich means that an eerie story is all that it is. When the Institute first \ninvestigated, it doesn’t look like they were able to find a single piece of \nevidence to support the existence of this scratched coffin, and to be honest I \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG002 – Do Not Open \n12 \n \ndidn’t think it was worth wasting anyone’s time over now, nearly twenty years \nlater. \nThat said, I did mention it to Tim yesterday, and apparently he did some \ndigging of his own. Breekon and Hope did, in fact, exist, and were a courier \nservice that operated until 2009, when they went into liquidation. They were \nbased in Nottingham, however, significantly north of Bournemouth, and if they \nkept records of their deliveries, they are no longer available. What is \ninteresting, however, is the address Mr. Gillespie provided for the flat this all \ntook place in. The housing association that ran it does keep extensive records \non the tenants that have lived in their buildings going back some forty or fifty \nyears.From what Tim could find, it appears that for the two years of his \nresidence, Mr Gillespie was the only person living in that entire building, with \nthe other seven flats being utterly vacant. Nobody moved in following his \ndeparture, and the building was sold to a developer and demolished shortly \nafter this statement was originally given. Predictably, no-one who worked for \nthat housing association in the 90s is still there, and despite Tim’s best efforts, \nwe could get no explanation for why, in a building of that size, Mr Gillespie \nspent almost two years living alone, save for an old wooden coffin.
