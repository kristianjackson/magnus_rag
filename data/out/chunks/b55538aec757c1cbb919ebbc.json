Please inform him we’re here. \nROSIE \nI really don’t think that that’s a— \nARCHIVIST \nI insist. \n(Rosie sighs) \nROSIE \n(Softly) Your funeral... \n[Hissing static fades a little as she takes a couple of steps] \n[She clicks an intercom switch, and a swirling static starts] \nROSIE \nExcuse me, sir. Two gentlemen here to see you. \nARCHIVIST \nThe Archivist. And Martin Blackwood. \nROSIE \nThe Archivist. And, uh... an ‘associate’. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 192 – An Appointment \n \n14 \nMARTIN \nOuch. \n[Strange electronic sounds and growls come from the intercom] \nROSIE \nYes I— \nYes, I-I understand, I, I jus— \nI— Sorry to interrupt. \n[Intercom clicks off, swirling static stops] \n(Firm, but with a slight tremor) Like I said, unless you have an appointment \nthere’s nothing I can do. \nARCHIVIST \nI understand. \nROSIE \n(Tremor) Now, I’m sorry, but if there’s nothing else, I’m going to have to ask \nyou to leave. I’m very busy. \nARCHIVIST \nOf course. \n[Footsteps as they walk away, to speak aside] \n[Hissing static becomes very faint] \nMARTIN \nWhat’s she doing here? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 192 – An Appointment \n \n15 \nARCHIVIST \nShe’s his assistant. So The Eye put her here. \nMARTIN \nDid she… choose it? \nARCHIVIST \nDid any of us? \nMARTIN \nSo, what? She’s just gone? She doesn’t remember us at all? \nARCHIVIST \nTo a degree but— \n(Discomfited noise from the Archivist) \nMARTIN \nAre you alri— Oh. \nARCHIVIST \nI-I’m sorry. \nMARTIN \nOh Christ, go on… \n[Hissing static gets louder] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 192 – An Appointment \n \n16 \n[The Panopticon noises fade away; replaced by the ticking clock of \nElias’ office, paper turning and rustles, and chair squeaks; the \nArchivist’s voice no longer reverberates] \n[Hissing static ends] \nARCHIVIST \n“Nosy Rosie”, he had said. The words had been soft, hidden behind the CV he \nwas examining, but she heard them clear as day. \n“What did you say?” She tried to hide the hurt and disbelief, the sudden \nimpact of a childhood nickname she thought she had long since left behind. \n“Sorry?” His voice was light. “I don’t think I said anything.” \nThere was a long moment as Rosie stared at her interviewer. His expression \nwas a pure, friendly, confusion, a light sort of innocence that gave nothing \naway. But she had definitely heard it. Was he just going to pretend it hadn’t \nhappened? Apparently so. \nShe studied the face of ‘Elias Bouchard’. He seemed far too young for the role \nhe had apparently found himself in, with an old-fashioned haircut that seemed \nto accentuate the image rather than lessen it. How was he already the head of \nan academic institution? No doubt mummy and daddy had something to do \nwith it... The thought leapt across Rosie’s mind before she could stop it, and \nwith no small amount of bitterness. \nHis eyes, though, were different. There was something in them that unsettled \nher. They didn’t match the rest of his face. They were cold and grey, and \nsomehow so much older. \n[Paper sliding and pen click]", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 2, "chunk_count": 9, "chars": 3248}}
