So what are you going to do when you find it? \nGEORGIE \nWe’ve got some old tools. I guess we just mess with it until we smell gas, and \nthen back off, set something burning and leg it. It can’t be that hard to break a \nvalve. \nMELANIE \nJohn, you’re sure about this whole gas main thing? It just seems, I don’t know, \nreally mundane. \nARCHIVIST \nIt’s what Annabelle said, and she wasn’t lying. At least, she didn’t think she \nwas. \nBASIRA \nWell, it’s a bit late for second-guessing. \nMARTIN \nHow... \n[Martin’s chair creaks] \nMARTIN (CONT’D) \nHow big is the explosion going to be? \n \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 199 – Seeing it Through \n33 \nGEORGIE \nBig enough. Honestly, I’m kind of hoping there’s some sort of supernatural \nreason it will channel up into the tower, otherwise, um... it’s going to be bad \nnews down here. \nMARTIN \nDon’t get yourselves hurt. \nGEORGIE \nWell, we’ll do what we can, but, this is it. Whatever it takes, right? If there’s a \nprice we pay it. No hesitations. \nMELANIE \nAnd it’s hardly going to be a picnic for you either. You’re going up that tower to \nkill Elias, and if we muck up the timing, you’ll be up there when it blows. \nMARTIN \nJohn can’t do it. \nARCHIVIST \nWhat? \nMELANIE \nSure he can, just magic-laser-eye zap him or whatever, same as with all the \nothers. Like he did to Helen. \n(Martin sighs with frustration under Melanie’s words) \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 199 – Seeing it Through \n34 \nARCHIVIST \nListen Melanie— \nMELANIE \nIt’s fine. If we all get out of this, we can talk it through. And if not, well, it \ndoesn’t really matter, does it? \nARCHIVIST \nI suppose not. \nMARTIN \nYou’re not listening. I mean if he kills Jonah, then knowing our luck he’s just \ngoing to end up taking his place in the Panopticon, isn’t he? \nGEORGIE \n(Sighs) Good point. \nMARTIN \nHe can come up with me, but when it actually comes to Jonah... \nBASIRA \nYou’ll have to be the one to do it. \nMARTIN \nYeah. \nARCHIVIST \nMartin… I don’t— \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 199 – Seeing it Through \n35 \nBASIRA \nHave you got this? We can trade if you don’t think you can do it. \nMARTIN \nNo. No, I can do it. \nMELANIE \nMake sure it hurts. \nMARTIN \nOh, I will. \nMELANIE \nGood enough for me. \nBASIRA \nMe too. \nGEORGIE \nOkay. Sounds like we’ve got something like a plan. \n(Martin makes a sound of assent) \nBASIRA \nMakes a nice change. \n(Georgie makes a sound of assent) \nMELANIE \n(Brightly) It does, doesn’t it? Huh! \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 199 – Seeing it Through \n36 \nUh… So. When do we actually do it? \nGEORGIE \nFirst thing tomorrow. That’ll give us time to prep and rest. \nMARTIN \nSounds good to me. \n[Martin stands up] \nMELANIE \nRight. \n[Footsteps, chair scrape, and door sounds as they go to leave] \nBASIRA \nUmm, hey, John? Can you hang on a sec? \n[The footsteps of Melanie, Martin and Georgie echo down the \ntunnel corridor, fading away] \nARCHIVIST \nYeah? \nBASIRA \nI just mean… um… \nIf we don’t make it out of this... I wanted to say thanks. For coming back for \nme. (sighs) What I did... Who I was... I— Thanks.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 6, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 3142}}
