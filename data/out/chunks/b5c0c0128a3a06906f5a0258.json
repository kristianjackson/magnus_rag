The one thing it never does is \njust tell us what to do. It seeds us with this aching, impossible desire to change \nthe world, to bring it to us, and then it leaves us to guess and bicker and fight \nover how the hell you can actually do it. If it’s possible. Sometimes I think they \nunderstand us as little as we understand them. We don’t think like they do. \nGERTRUDE \nI'm not actually convinced they ‘think’ at all. \nARTHUR \nYou might be right, but Agnes did. That’s the thing about an incarnation, isn’t \nit? She was a child and person as much as she was a god. And we messed that \nright up. I still remember when Diego bought us a book on childcare. Roger’s \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 145 – Infectious Doubts \n \n12 \n \nbody was still in her room, blackened and smoking from when he tried to feed \nher. I thought for a moment he’d brought another one of his damn Leitners, \nbut no, it was just a regular old book on looking after children. But I was an \nidiot, saw it as attacking my leadership. Burned the thing. Diego wasn’t happy. \nWell, he’s in charge now, of all of us that are left, at least. He can look for the \nanswers in whatever books he likes, no skin off my bones. \nGERTRUDE \nI didn’t actually ask. \nARTHUR \nFigured if you’re gonna pull this stuff out of me, I might as well get some of it \noff my chest anyway. Not like I can vent to the others about what a prat Diego \nis. Got a lot of funny ideas, still calls the Lightless Flame ‘Asag’ like when he \nwas first researching it. I just want to tell him to get over it. I mean, Asag was \ntraditionally a force of destruction, sure, but as a church, we’ve very much \nsettled on burning in terms of the face we worship, so some fish-boiling \nSumerian demon doesn’t really match up, does it? Plus, there’s a lot of disease \nimagery with Asag that I reckon is way too close to Filth for my tastes. But no, \nhe read it in some ancient tome, so that’s that. \nGERTRUDE \nWell, I can’t say I know— \nARTHUR \nReckons he always knows best cos he’s read a few books. Well, big deal. Way I \nsee it, if a writer can’t even save themselves, they probably don’t have a lot \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 145 – Infectious Doubts \n \n13 \n \nworth knowing. Find me one so called ‘expert’ on all of this who didn’t end up \nregretting all of it. That’s the trouble with overthinking any of this: you ignore \nyour gut, and to mind, that’s the only part any of them beyond actually care \nabout. They don’t give a toss about your rules or systems. They only care about \nwhat feels right, what freezes your belly with terror. \nGERTRUDE \nI rather like to think I’ve managed. \nARTHUR \nYeah, but you don’t actually care about them, do you? Not really. You forget, \nwe’ve been watching you a long time, and I know you, Gertrude. You don’t \nactually care about the fears; you’re too practical. All your energy is focused \ndown here, on monsters and murderers and all the things doing the dirty work \nfor them beyond. You know plenty, sure, but you don’t have that obsession, \nthat stupid urge to try and understand and classify things that use logic and \nreality like weapons. \nGERTRUDE \nHm, perhaps. \nARTHUR \nAlways respected you for that. It takes a strong stomach to not give a shit. \nGERTRUDE \nYou’ll forgive me if I’m not overjoyed at the compliment.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 3, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 3315}}
