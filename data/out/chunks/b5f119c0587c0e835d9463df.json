In \nfact it seemed like he was just wandering through the woods with the clothes \non his back. \nArden was quicker to pick up on this than I was and asked the man if he \nneeded any help. The hiker stared at him for several long seconds, as though \ntrying to deduce something, then smiled and said, “No”. I didn’t like that smile \none bit. Far too many teeth to it, I’d say. He asked us where we were heading, \nhow long we were on the trail for. There was something ever so slightly odd \nabout his intonation, and he dragged the Rs somehow when he spoke. We \nanswered as vaguely as we could without being rude, since neither of us felt \ncomfortable near this man. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG031 – First Hunt \n5 \n \nThe hiker shrugged, and started to walk across the trail, between us. As he did \nso, he paused for a second, and took a deep breath, and it seemed for all the \nworld like he was sniffing us. Then he said something, I forget exactly. \n“Tomorrow will be a good day for a run,” or something like that. And then he \njust started whistling again, and wandered off into the forest behind us. I think \nboth myself and Arden wanted to stop him, it was so clear something wasn’t \nright with the situation, but we were both… astounded with his manner and I \ndon’t think either of us could have thought of how to do so. And then he was \ngone. \nI needn’t tell you that sleep came difficult. The sounds of the forest at night \nwere far louder than I had ever heard them back home, and every cracking \nbranch, every rustle of leaves, set my nerves on edge. It was an overcast night, \nand outside the tent was almost completely dark. Around two o’clock in the \nmorning I could have sworn that I heard someone laugh, slow and softly, \noutside my tent. It sound like it was right by my head, just the other side of the \nthin nylon wall. By the time I’d managed to get up the courage to check, of \ncourse, there was nobody there. \nThe next day we packed up the camp and set off hunting again, donning our \nlurid orange vests and rifles. I must admit, I felt ten times better with the \nweight of the gun in my arms, and was inclined to put the events of the night \nbefore behind me. In fact, after a morning spent walking and joking and, on \ntwo occasions, damn near bagging an elk, I thought we were both having a \nsplendid time. It was about four in the afternoon, the sun just starting to begin \nits descent towards an early autumn dusk, when I saw my elk. I don’t know \nwhy, but when I saw him through the trees I knew that he was mine. I told \nArden and we started to creep towards it very slowly. He had been teaching \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG031 – First Hunt \n6 \n \nme since yesterday, and it wasn’t long before I had my position, and raised my \ngun. I sighted it just below the ear, and there was a moment, when its head \nturned right towards me. I could have sworn it looked me in the eye as I \nprepared to pull the trigger. \nA gunshot rang out, but it was not from my gun. The elk startled and ran, and I \nspun round, but Arden was nowhere to be seen. The shot still echoed through \nthe trees, but he seemed to have vanished. I began to search frantically for \nhim. Had he… Had he been lured away by an elk of his own? Had he been \naccidentally shot by some other hunters? I called out his name, but there was \nno reply. \nEventually, after several minutes of desperate searching, I came to a small \nclearing. There, slumped against one of the trees was Arden. He was dead. The \ntree behind him was painted in a spray of crimson, and there was a messy hole \nin the centre of his throat, as though it had been torn out entirely. His rifle lay \nnext to him on the ground, also coated in blood. It seems silly to say now, but \nmy first thought was to check his pulse. So I put my gun down to do so. \nObviously he didn’t have one, but I couldn’t understand what was happening. \nI’d been with him not three minutes before and he had been alive and \nunharmed. It didn’t make sense. \nThen I heard that whistling. That infernal whistling from the treeline. I turned \nand there was the hiker. His right hand was coated in Arden’s blood, and he \ngrinned at me. Then he began to sprint. His speed was incredible, and he loped \nfrom side to side with a sort of zigzag motion. I ran. I know I should have \npicked up my gun, but you can’t understand just how frightening it is to have \nsomething like that, a true predator, running at you full pelt.
