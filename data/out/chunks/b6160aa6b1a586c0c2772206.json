He made me shut the steamer trunk almost as soon as \nhe saw them, and kept looking over to make sure it was closed. I decided not \nto tell him about the first time it had popped open. \nHe asked if I could play anything on the ancient steam organ, and so I sat down \nand began to play my grandpa's old circus tune. Again I began to pick up speed, \nto play faster and faster as the whistles began to shriek. I felt a hand touch \nmine firmly, abruptly stopping the music. Josh stood there, shaking slightly, his \nface deathly pale. On impulse I looked over to the chest of dolls, but the lid \nwas firmly shut. I asked him what was wrong and he said he didn't know. He \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG024 – Strange Music \n9 \n \njust wanted to leave. Now. So we did. Climbed back down out of the loft, and I \nlowered the wooden trapdoor behind us. \nThe next few weeks were... unpleasant. I don't want to go into detail. Let's just \nsay I discovered that Josh was just another asshole after all. Our relationship \nwas already going through a rocky patch. It didn't help that in those last weeks \nhe became moody, short-tempered, constantly on edge. When I finally found \nout that he had... It doesn't matter. We broke up. It left me pretty much \ndestroyed, coming so soon after my grandpa's death. I just tuned everything \nout again. \nEventually, it was tripping over a box that did it. One of the ones I'd put all my \ngrandpa's stuff into, and never actually got round to putting in the loft. I \ndecided to just get it over with. I guess I hoped a tidier house would give me \nmore space to think. So for the third time, I got out that ladder and climbed \ninto the loft. If didn't take as long to store all the boxes as I'd thought, and \nwithin an hour I was done. I had been so intent on packing away all my \nmemories that I hadn't even looked at the old steamer trunk. As I went to \nclimb down I glanced over, and I froze. \nThe lid was open again, and the clown doll was on top. It wasn't looking at me \nthis time. Instead, it seemed to be facing a doll I hadn't seen before. This one \nstill had its jaw as well, and I swear it looked just like Josh. Same tatty brown \njacket, same old jeans. Its black, woollen hair even did that flicky thing he \nalways spent so long getting right. It was lying against the side of the box, and I \nswear it looked like the clown was reaching for it. I slammed the box lid down \nand got the hell out of there. I bought a padlock the next day. \nNow, I've brought a copy of the police report I gave, because you have to \nbelieve me that I did not play that calliope again. I had nothing to do with what \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG024 – Strange Music \n10 \n \nhappened to Josh. I came home from the cinema about a week later to find \nthat my grandpa— my house had been broken into. Here, it's all in the report \non the burglary I gave to the police. The front door lock was shattered and it \nswung gently to and fro. At first I ran into my living room, my bedroom, but \nnothing had been taken. The electronics, my jewellery, it was untouched. I felt \nmy stomach drop as I realised and ran towards the loft. Sure enough, it was \nopen, the padlock torn from its hook. The calliope and the steamer trunk were \ngone. \nThey questioned my neighbours about it. None of them had seen anything \nexcept for Mrs. Harlow next door, who said she noticed two people taking out \npieces of red sheet metal and brass pipes. She didn't remember any details, \njust said that they “looked legitimate” and she thought I was having some \nthings moved. The police never found them. \nI just need you to believe that. To know I didn't play the thing again. It wasn't \nmy fault, what happened to Josh. God knows I hated him enough back then, \nbut… I could never called anything like that upon him. Not like that. I don't \nsuppose you need me to tell you how they found him. Four days later, dead in \nhis room. His throat was crushed. And his jaw was torn clean off. The police \nnever found it. \nI wouldn't have thought of it, really. Wouldn't have… put it all together even \nthen. Not if it hadn't been for the fact that, in the last days of our relationship, \nJosh had broken down. He told me that he still heard that calliope music. Far \noff, when he was alone. And it had been getting gradually closer. I mean, they \nsay you can hear one from almost a mile away.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 4, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 4393}}
