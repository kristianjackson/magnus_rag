The temperature \nshould be kept the steady, humid warmth of air conditioners struggling to cope \nwith the perspiration of a dozen bodies pushing themselves too hard, while the \nlights must be kept at a harsh, fluorescent glare. Counterintuitively, growth is \nmost effective when the orchid is suffering from aggressive dehydration, and it \nis vitally important that the air roots be rarely praised, and only for the flowers' \nappearance and growth. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 171 – The Gardener \n10 \nAbove all, the deepest fear must be laced throughout what the Gristlebloom \nOrchid is fed: That they're not enough. That their inadequacies are embedded \nall the way into their flesh, and that they must always and forever be more. \nThis unspoken terror can be viewed in the intricate lattices that marble the \ngory petals of a well-cared for Gristlebloom as it expands and swells and grows \nto its full and bulbous potential. Never let it believe itself good enough, and \ncontinue always to ensure the body that it is certain it must attain is that \nimpossible, distended mess to which it will endlessly contort itself until it \ndominates your garden in its sheer, impossible, beautiful mass. \nEven if there were mirrors in this place, Reece could not possibly recognize \nhimself. Not because anything that might once have registered as a human \nbody has long since blossomed into sinewy flowers and muscles and burst skin, \nbut because, were he to see himself, the only image in his mind would be the \nhim he was so afraid to be. And the Gristlebloom Orchid grows. \nThe agonies of this gore-streaked orchid are pointedly exquisite as it willingly \nand keenly pushes its physical form past any recognizable point of pain and \nshuddering anxiety until it towers over your garden, dripping blood and bitter \nsweat. \nCultivation notes for Gracillium Patricia, commonly known as the Bone Rose. \nWhile the Gristlebloom Orchid may be the most eye-catching of the plants that \nyou will find in the mortal garden, the Bone Rose is perhaps the most delicate. \nThin and brittle, it is constantly on the verge of collapsing under its own \nweight, even as its ossified stems reach and twist and stretch in a desperate \nattempt for closeness. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 171 – The Gardener \n11 \nThe soil for the Bone Rose must be thoroughly rotten, a mulch of corrupted \nromanticism turned toxic and watered by an uncertain desire that curls back \nupon the roots and feeds into it a single, constant, pulsing thought, an instinct \nthat fuels every cell within the rose: ‘To be wanted you must be less.’ \nThe temperature should be kept cold for optimal development, the coldness of \nrejection, of hostile and pitying glances cast over a hated body. A coldness that \ncreeps through the bones and lashes the vicious iciness to the flower's core. \nLight should be unrelenting, allowing every flaw and mark and sag to be stared \nat and warped and ogled. \nWith this preparation, the Bone Rose will conceive a grotesque horror of its \nown flesh, of the skin and fats and all that makes a body present. It will tear \nand starve and leak until there is nought but bones, the hungry bones so \ndesperate to be touched, to be held. To be wanted. \nPatricia is beautiful at last, so sharp and narrow and hard. Her angles and \ncreamy white entirety is the centre of the garden for all to admire. But she \nstrains and shakes and fears the wind that pushes and bends the brittle \nstiffness of the bones. It takes every drop of her strength to keep herself aloft, \nto not collapse in a heap of splintered femur and broken rib. There is no \nmoment of her new existence that is not a shuddering, terrified effort. She is \nbeautiful. And she cannot allow herself to lose that at any cost. She cannot \nshatter into fleshly ugliness again. \nThe Bone Rose, properly cultivated, will be a fearful and wonderful centrepiece \nfor a carefully tended mortal garden. \nCultivation notes for Secarium Leopold, commonly known as the Cutaway \nTulip.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 2, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 4254}}
