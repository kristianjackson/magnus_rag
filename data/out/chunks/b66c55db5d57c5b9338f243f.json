I \ntried to explain that I’ve never had hallucinations while drunk, and that there \nwas no way this guy had just been a normal person, but they always gave me \none of those looks, halfway between pity and concern, and I’d shut up. \nI never did find out anything else about it, but a few days later I saw some \nmissing person appeals go up around campus. Another student had \ndisappeared. John Fellowes, his name was, though I didn’t really know the guy \nand couldn’t tell you much about him, except for two things that struck me as \nvery important: he had been at that same party and, as far as I remembered, \nhad still been there when I left. The other was just that, well, on the photo \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG001 – Anglerfish \n8 \n \nthey’d used for his missing persons appeal I couldn’t help but notice that there \nwas a pack of Marlboro Red cigarettes poking out of his pocket. \nI haven’t quit smoking, but I do find that I take a lot more taxis now if I find \nmyself out too late. \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nStatement ends. \nThe investigation at the time, and the follow-up we’ve done over the last \ncouple have days, have found no evidence to corroborate Mr. Watts’ account \nof his experience. \nI was initially inclined to re-file this statement in the ‘Discredited’ section of the \nArchive, a new category I’ve created that will, I suspect, be housing the \nmajority of these files. \nHowever, Sasha did some digging into the police reports of the time and it \nturns out that between 2005 and 2010, when Mr Watts’ encounter supposedly \ntook place, there were six disappearances in and around the Old Fishmarket \nClose: Jessica McEwen in November 2005, Sarah Baldwin in August 2006, \nDaniel Rawlings in December of the same year, then Ashley Dobson and \nMegan Shaw in May and June of 2008. Then finally, as Mr Watts mentioned, \nJohn Fellowes in March 2010. All six disappearances remain unsolved. \nBaldwin and Shaw were definitely smokers, but there’s no evidence either way \nabout the others, if they’re even connected. Sasha did find one other thing, \nspecifically in the case of Ashley Dobson. It was a copy of the last photograph \ntaken by her phone and sent to her sister Siobhan. The caption was “check out \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG001 – Anglerfish \n9 \n \nthis drunk creeper lol”, but the picture is of a darkened, apparently empty, \nalleyway, with stairs leading up into it. \nIt appears to be the same alleyway which Mr Watts described in his statement, \nthe one that, according to the maps of the area, leads to Tron Square, but \nthere doesn’t seem to be anyone in the photograph at all. Sasha took the \nliberty of running it through some editing programs, though, and increasing \nthe contrast appears to reveals the outline of a long, thin hand, roughly at \nwhat would be waist level on a male of average height. I find it oddly hard to \nshake off the impression that it’s beckoning. \nEnd recording. \n[The Magnus Archives Theme - Outro] \n \nThe Magnus Archives is a podcast distributed by Rusty Quill and licensed under \na creative commons attribution, non-commercial share alike 4.0 international \nlicense.
