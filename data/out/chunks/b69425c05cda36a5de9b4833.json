I would have \nexpected the burns to have almost destroyed tattoos that small but instead \nthey were unblemished and the skin about a centimetre around each one also \ndidn’t seem to have been affected. \nTo say I was unsettled by this would have been something of an \nunderstatement. I barely noticed when the Dr Grice and the EMTs returned. \nThey seemed to be talking normally now, and discussing who these two people \nwere. Apparently the fire brigade had responded to reports of a blaze in a \nbuilding site near St Mary’s churchyard, and had turned up to find the two men \nlying unconscious. There had been no fire, although the ground they lay on \nshowed several burn marks and a metal bar that had been lying nearby \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG012 – First Aid \n5 \n \nappeared to have bent slightly as if from great heat. The fire service had called \nout an ambulance, and they had brought the men here. Apparently the older \none hadn’t had anything on him at all, no ID, no phone, no keys, nothing, while \nthe younger man had only a Zippo lighter with an eye design on it similar to the \none tattooed all over him and a old passport that identified him as Gerard \nKeay. I never got a look at the passport, but from the way the EMTs were \ntalking about it I gathered the man was well travelled. \nIt was at this point that the EMTs had to head out on another call, and Dr Grice \nand I got down to treating the two men, the weirdness temporarily forgotten. \nMedically speaking, there was nothing abnormal about the burns, and it didn’t \ntake as long as I had feared to get them properly cleaned and bandaged. \nThroughout it all, the two of them didn’t stir, and I wondered if they were \ncomatose, but that sort of diagnosis would require a lot more testing, which \nprobably wasn’t going to happen that night. So having finished giving them \nwhat treatment we could, the men were moved to one of the few wards with \nbed space and I returned to working A&E. And, for an hour or so, I forgot about \nthe odd strangers that lay unconscious just a few doors away. \nI only noticed them again when I had to pass through that ward heading \ntowards the nearby stockroom for some more gauze. As I walked through, I \nbecame aware of a sound coming from the bed of the older burn victim. I \nnever did find out his name. I walked towards him slowly, straining my ears to \nhear what he was saying. It was so quiet as to be almost inaudible, but was \ndefinitely words, the same words over and over; the more I heard, the more it \nsounded like most of them weren’t in English. The first sounded like “Asak” or \n“Asag”, then “Veepalach” and finally in English “The lightless flame”. The last \npart was very clear, and I assumed he was talking about whatever burned him,", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 2, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 2876}}
