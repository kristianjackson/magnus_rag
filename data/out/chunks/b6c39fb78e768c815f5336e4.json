It was so \nbig it made me lightheaded to think about it, to try and place myself in some \nbelievable scale against it. I think it was a hand, but I could not see enough to \nbe sure. Then it moved, slowly but clearly, and I realised how far away it still \nwas, as it got bigger and bigger and bigger and I could see nothing else and I \nscreamed. \nIt was the jagged metal of the hole itself that saved me in the end. As I cried \nout in horror, I felt the sharp edges of it digging into my hands and they \ngripped it, and the unexpected burst of pain snapped me out of whatever it \nwas that held me in place. With a surge of strength, I pushed myself back into \nthe boat and I felt the pressure lift all at once. Of course, this brought its own \nset of problems, but I didn't care. The light-headedness was already setting in \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG051 – High Pressure \n8 \n \nand my vision was blurring when I swam out of the sunken ship and headed \ntowards the surface at full speed, ignoring all decompression procedures. I \nblacked out 30 feet from the surface. \nI have vague memories of the trip back, fading in and out of consciousness, \nfeeling the worst I have ever felt in my life. Then I recall a helicopter, shouting, \nand finally waking up fully in a hospital bed. Captain Kemp was there and he \nimmediately laid into me, calling me all sorts of horrendous names, before \ninforming me exactly how serious my condition had been and how lucky I was \nto be alive. I should be dead, he told me, and I know he was right. \nI left the company soon afterwards. I still plan to go back some day, but it'll be \na while longer before I am comfortable in the water again. Julio never came to \nvisit me in hospital and I was unable to get in contact with him after I was \ndischarged. I hope he's alright. I did ask Captain Kemp what happened to the \njob after I left, as I also hadn't seen the old man since that morning. The \ncaptain got a strange look in his eyes then and gazed out of the window with a \nscowl I had never seen on his face before. \"The sea is a dangerous place,\" he \nsaid, and walked away. \nJONATHAN SIMS \nStatement ends. \n \nNo real follow-up can be made to this statement, as it all took place in \nCanadian territory, and we don't have the contacts over there that we do here. \nNot to mention that what little I could glean appears to be a mass of \noverlapping and conflicting police, coastguard and port authority reports. We \ncould spend years trying to unravel this one case if we had a mind to and I, for \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG051 – High Pressure \n9 \n \none, do not. We weren't even able to glean sufficient information to track \ndown any of those mentioned in the statement, aside from Captain Morton \nKemp, who now runs boat tours near Winnipeg and declined to comment on it \nin the strongest possible terms. \nInstead I will focus on Simon Fairchild, who I recall may have come up in case \n#0022010, along with a young woman. \nI may have encountered Fairchild before, or it may just be a coincidence of \nnames. One of my first cases as a researcher for the Institute in 2012, was \nlooking into the history of a jewellers in Hackney that had reported cases \nbecoming cracked in the night. Nothing was ever taken, but each morning it \nwould be like a heavy weight had been dropped upon them. \nLooking into it, it turned out that the jewellers had, in the 1930s, belonged to a \ncon artist and fence who had attracted the displeasure of the local population. \nWhen one particularly irate customer threw him out of a fourth-floor window \ninto a crowded street at midday, no one claimed to have seen anything. A \nminor possible haunting with a decidedly pedestrian backstory, but notable \nbecause, while I was never able to discover the original name of the con artist, \none of his many, many aliases was Simon Fairchild, and had appeared on \nseveral business listings around the time. \nWhether it's a coincidence or not is something of a moot point at this stage, \nhowever. A cursory bit of research reveals the Fairchilds in question to be an \nexceptionally wealthy family based down in Cornwall. \nNo real business to speak of, but it appears they've invested very wisely in \naerospace technology, shipping logistics and underwater drilling and \nconstruction. Whatever their origin, I feel it's worth keeping an eye on them.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 4, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 4355}}
