He tries not \nto stare at the implements that hang on the wall as he is placed on a wide \nmetal plate in the centre. He feels it yield slightly under his feet, and a weight \nappears on a screen set back into the wall. One of the things adjusting the \nequipment seems to become aware of this, though how it could have seen the \nmeasurement Tyler does not know, and it snatches the forms that he still \ncarries from his hand. \n[Distorted grunts and page-snatching] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 178 – The Processing Line \n11 \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nThe noises that come from behind the mask seem to indicate the weight does \nnot match what he has put down on his paperwork and, despite everything, \nTyler is suddenly gripped with a panic that he might somehow be in trouble. \n[Grunting continues] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nThe disruption passes quickly and the things move on to other tests: poking, \nlifting, stretching his limbs, and assessing them with strange metal tools. Even \nif he had the will to, Tyler could not have struggled: the movements of the \nthings scrutinizing him are as gently unstoppable as a piston. Finally, he is led \nover to a grate on the floor. \n[Swift metallic noise with bubbling sound] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nHe barely even has time to register the red-hot wire cutter before it is in and \nout of his left arm with practiced, professional ease, neatly removing a small \nwedge of muscle. There is almost a full second of numb confusion before the \npain finally hits, and Tyler begins to scream. \nThe figures surrounding him do not seem to notice, instead fussing over the \nsample they have taken, examining it in minute detail and silently conferring \nabout it. Then they all nod at once, and the tiny chunk of meat is tossed away \ndown a nearby disposal. \n[Meat lands wetly] \n[Metallic buzzing starts] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 178 – The Processing Line \n12 \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nOne of them moves to the wall and picks up a long metal rod connected to an \nintricate arrangement of looping metal. \nTyler is so preoccupied with the pain in his arm, he doesn’t notice the switch \nturn on, or the metal begin to glow red with heat. When the brand hits him in \nthe small of his back, he has no idea what is happening. \n[Flesh sizzles; more grunting follows] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nThe sensation is so overwhelming that it’s only after they push him out down a \nlong metal chute and he finds himself at the back of another queue, he realises \nwhat has happened, as he sees the stamp of this place scorched into every \nback that stretches off into the distance. \n[A rhythmic processing sound slowly builds in volume] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nThis is the last processing line. Tyler can feel that truth deep inside him. There \nis no longer the wide open space surrounding them. Instead the head-height \ndividers lock them into single file, snaking back and forth in a zig-zag as their \npath approaches the shining metal gate at the end. The ground is angled ever \nso slightly down, making it uncomfortable to stand still, and always gently \nurging them to move forward. At last, the prospect of seeing what might \nhappen if he runs from the line seems worth it to Tyler, but the realisation sets \nin that it is far, far too late for that. \nOne step, then another, then another. The production balance of this place \nmeans it must be impossible for this line to be moving quicker than the ones", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 3, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 3634}}
