I’m the reason he— I did this to him as much as you. \nPETER \nYes. I suppose you did. \nWhere are your friends, Archivist? \nARCHIVIST \nTim and Sasha are dead. \nPETER \nYes? \nARCHIVIST \nDaisy and Basira are, probably dead. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 159 – The Last \n \n7 \nPETER \nBecause. Of. You. \nARCHIVIST \nGeorgie and Melanie have left me. \nPETER \nAnd? \nARCHIVIST \nMartin’s gone. \nPETER \nYou’re alone, Archivist. The last one standing. I did warn you. I did want you to \nleave but, perhaps it would be better if you stayed awhile. After all, you can’t \nhurt anyone in here. \nARCHIVIST \n…Yes… \nPETER \nYes. \n[The Archivist stops walking] \n(Beat) \n[Peter is there] \n[Hissing static starts] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 159 – The Last \n \n8 \nARCHIVIST \nOr perhaps you could answer some questions. \nPETER \nWhat? \nARCHIVIST \nI wouldn’t try to leave if I were you.

I can find you wherever \nyou go. \n[Hissing static ends] \n[The Lonely static gets louder] \n[Footstep] \n(Peter’s voice stops shifting side to side, and no longer echoes) \nPETER \nFine. It was just a thought. So leave. \n[The Lonely static become faint] \nARCHIVIST \nNot before I get some answers. \nPETER \nThat’s not going to happen. \nARCHIVIST \nTell me your story, Peter Lukas. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 159 – The Last \n \n9 \n[Hissing static starts] \nPETER \nNo. \nARCHIVIST \n(Compelling) Tell me! \n[Hissing static intensifies] \n(Peter makes a pained noises) \nPETER \n(Pained) Fine! Fine! \nWhere do you want to begin? \n[Hissing static ends] \nPETER (CONT’D) \nThe start? A lonely youth? My gradual path to becoming an only child? That’s \nthe thing, you see, about a family faith, you’ve got to double down on the \nbelievers. My mother had five children over her life, before my father finally \ndrifted away. She was a Lukas to the core, though not born into the family, \nwhile my father, for all he believed himself keen on a life without obligation, \ngradually withered away to nothing as she cultivated the space between them. \nThe house was sprawling, our bedrooms were kept as far apart as possible and \nchanged often as we were cared for by a rotating cast of nannies and tutors. \nYou know, she’s still alive, but I still can’t picture my mother’s face with any \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 159 – The Last \n \n10 \nclarity, and I consider that a blessing. I’m not even burdened by hatred for her, \nshe is simply someone who exists far away from me. \nIt was the sort of childhood that would not be allowed if we didn’t have \nmoney, but we’re an old family with shall we say a remarkably direct line of \ninheritance. The sort of family where no social worker would even be allowed \non the property. But for all that, aside from a few oddities of faith, I don’t \nknow how different my upbringing was from other scions of aristocracy. (slight \nchuckle) From what I understand, severing the connection to your humanity is \na cornerstone of an upper class education, though I was spared the targeted \ntraumas of boarding school as my mother clearly believed the danger of \nfriendship was too acute. \nI suppose to call myself an only child is technically untrue. Two of my sisters \nstill live, though they disavowed the family and moved far, far away. Still, to be \ncut off from one’s family is its own very special sort of loneliness, isn’t it? So \nwe all serve in our own ways. The other two, my brother Aaron and sister \nJudith, well, they weren’t considerate enough to quietly grow to adulthood \nand disappear. They simply didn’t have the temperament to thrive in the Lukas \nhousehold, always trying to instigate games, make friends, connect with \npeople. As far as I’m aware they were sent away to live their lives with very \ndistant relatives, never to return. I’m sure it’s possible my mother resolved the \nmatter in a less pleasant manner, but in my limited interaction with her she \nnever struck me as a cruel woman, and I would imagine for children that age \nthe fear and isolation of being uprooted and sent away is just as strong as that \nof meeting a more… grisly fate. \nI, of course, was the favoured son, being quiet and reserved and, at all points, \ndeeply engaged with my own loneliness.
