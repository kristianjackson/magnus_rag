Audio recording \nby Jonathan Sims, Head Archivist of the Magnus Institute, London. \nStatement begins. \nJONATHAN SIMS \n(Read aloud from the archived witness statement of Sampson Kempthorne) \nDear Jonah, \nIt is my fondest wish that this message should find you in good health, as I \nhave heard more than one mutual acquaintance remark on your current state \nof overwork. While I earnestly hope it is merely idle gossip, my knowledge of \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG050 – Foundations \n2 \n \nyour character leads me to entreat that you allow yourself some respite. Or at \nthe very least, take some further secretarial staff into your employ. Certain \nuncharitable quarters would have it that your life consists of little but rattling \naround an Edinburgh townhouse, surrounded by piles of ghostly accounts and \nlunatic documentation. Piles, I am afraid to say, to which I am about to make \nan addition. \nI would suggest you come visit with myself and Marianne as a diversion, but if \nyou were of a mind to do so, you must travel swiftly. You see, we are shortly to \ndepart for New Zealand, there to start a new life, far from London and its \nworkhouses, and it is this imminent departure that has such a freeing effect \nupon my pen. For there are things I have seen which I feel deserve a place \namong your asylum of letters. They regard the works of my former assistant, \nGeorge Gilbert Scott, whose own architectural practice is now most respected. \nI have been fearful that accusations of slander might dog me were my tale to \nbe set down, but with a boat to the new world beckoning and your sterling \nreputation for discretion, I feel it may at last be time to divest myself of the \ndisquieting scenes I have witnessed. \nGeorge came to me in 1834 from his engagement with the office of Henry \nRoberts, where he was completing his training. Henry himself I have the \ngreatest respect for, as he trained under Sir Robert Smirke, who had received \nhis knighthood not two years previous. Henry was very effusive about the \ntalents and prospects of young Mr Scott and was at great pains to inform me \nthat his young protege had also received certain architectural tutelages from \nSir Robert himself. He said this with the oddest of looks, as though there was \nsome jolly secret between us. I rather just nodded as if to say I took his \nmeaning and he left well enough alone. He even showed me George’s work on", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 0, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 3003}}
