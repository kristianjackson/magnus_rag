We're not talking about innocent bystanders in \ncafes here, John; these things are… th-they're just evil, plain and simple, and \nright now they're torturing and tormenting everyone! \nIf you want to stop them and have the power to, then, then, then yeah, let's do \nit, let's go full Kill Bill! \nARCHIVIST \nI-I, I haven't seen it. \nHELEN \nOh, Martin, I am so proud of you.

He had not always been a worm, of \ncourse, but time and tide and life had pushed him to it. His name, he dimly \nrecalled, was Sam, and he was, as definitely always had been the case, \ntrapped. Boarded on all sides with no escape and no recourse. Even in his faint \nand fading memories of a life that wasn't simply stone and rancid, reeking soil, \nhe wasn't sure he'd ever known a thing that might be called freedom. \n[Screams fade away as worming squelching and low muffled noise \nbegin] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 166 – The Worms \n10 \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nChoices he had had, that's true, and certainly compared to the relentless press \nof all the weight and dirt now on him, the simple choice of left or right or stand \nor sit would now seem the most outrageous of luxuries. But at the time, there \nwas no joy in such decisions, for though he could point his feet left, it was a \nrightward turn that led him to the place where he could scrape a meagre living. \nAnd while he could choose to sit, it rarely made the news any more pleasant to \nhear. \nWhen had the crushing pressure in his chest become literal? When had the \nempty promise of the horizon finally vanished completely, replaced by the \npitch darkness of this forever wall of earth? Sam did not know. Time had no \nmeaning here. There were no clocks or watches, and somewhere in his mind \nhe was sure that the world had stopped spinning, his prison was still. Even that \nsingle, distant point of light, so impossibly far above him that he had decided \nthat it must be the sky, even that never darkened with the recognition of night. \nHis existence was static, and eternal. Immutable. Sleep was only a memory, \nbecause even the prospect of unconsciousness might have made his present \nstate slightly more bearable. Food as well he knew must be a thing, for he \ncould feel the hunger, but his imagination failed to picture it. The only smell he \nknew was the damp and the dirt. \nBut these things, grim and fearful as they were, were not unfamiliar. The \naching hunger was not new, not simply a gift of the eager soil.
