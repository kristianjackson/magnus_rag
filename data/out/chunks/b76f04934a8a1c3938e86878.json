But there is no mercy for deserters here. On \none side of the trench the hungry guns of the vile enemy wait. And on the \nother, the just guns of heroes will cut you down no slower, save perhaps a \nbreath to call you coward. So, she waits there, in the middle, with the weeping \nwounded and the soon to be dead. Waiting for the enemy to overrun them. \nSometimes, in the distance, Hasanna sees them. The enemy, their skin rough, \ndark, and scaly; their faces twisted around cruel tusks, viciously sharpened \nteeth, and a pair of beady red eyes. Their lips are smeared crimson with the \nblood of children, and their greatest delight is to pluck the eyes of the innocent \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 163 – In the Trenches \n16 \nwith their bayonets. To call them monsters is the simple truth. They feel no \npain, no remorse, and seek nothing but carnage. Sometimes, in the distance, \nHasanna can even see an enemy triage tent, almost identical in appearance to \nher own. She can only imagine the atrocities that must take place inside. Far in \nthe distance, she sees Alexei look out over the battlefield, and her stomach \nturns at the detestable wrongness of his face. \nAlexei in turn looks out from deep in the trench. He catches sight of the \nenemy, their shrivelled rat-like heads causing the bile to rise in his throat. He is \nbored. The boredom is the worst part, the part that erodes his will and drops \nhim to despair. There is nothing to do, nowhere to be. The only thing to occupy \nhis mind is the inevitability of the next attack, the next order to charge, the \nnext dropping bomb. There is no way to know when and where these things \nwill come. But no one will talk of anything else. \nHis stomach growls, the hunger pushing its sharp fingers out from his belly. \nThere are no more rations, and what there is tastes of cordite and sand, and \ncoats his tongue in an oily film that makes him gag. He has heard the enemy \nwill eat your body if they find it in the mud. They won’t even check if you’re \ndead first. Alexei shudders at the thought. \nFrom far down the trench, a cry of panic cuts through the silence. A faint haze \ncan be seen in the distance, moving with the breeze. A new weapon? Alexei \nfeels his knees start to buckle as he sees his comrades stagger out of the cloud. \nTheir melting teeth flow down their faces like tears, and their limbs begin to \nfold and collapse as the bones within them liquefy. He turns and starts to flee \ndown the trench. There is no cruelty so foul the enemy will not perpetrate it. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 163 – In the Trenches \n17 \nHe runs almost headfirst into a portly man in a tailored suit with a blood-red \nflower on his lapel. He smiles, pale skin splitting beneath his bristling white \nmoustache, and he begins to shake Alexei by the hand. \n“Good lad,” he says. “Good lad. Heroes one and all. A noble sacrifice.” \nAlexei starts to speak, to say he doesn’t want to be a hero; he doesn’t want to \nbe a sacrifice; he wants to go home. But the man with the flower reaches his \nhand into the soldier’s chest, and with a single, jolly motion, plucks out Alexei’s \nheart and places it in his wallet. \nNext to his bleeding corpse, Charlie wakes from what passes for sleep in this \nplace. A sergeant is yelling at him, screaming for him to take his gun and get \ninto the waiting transport. There’s about to be another attack, and heavy \nlosses are expected. A familiar fear courses through him, but Charlie still picks \nup his gun, and goes back to the war. \n(The Archivist sighs heavily) \nARCHIVIST \nI, um.
