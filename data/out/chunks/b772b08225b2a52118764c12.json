The security office was a \nmess. The company I worked for – again, don’t know if I can legally say them, \nbut you can look it up, you know – they have a package where they’ll replace \nall your equipment and systems with the stuff we use. It’s not cheap, but it’s \nworth it, if only cos we all know exactly how to use that stuff. \nWhoever was running this shopping centre had very much not opted for that \nparticular contract. I mean, the teams before us had made a valiant effort to \ncentralise and integrate all the feeds and set-ups into just the one control \nroom, but damn was that place a mess. Flatscreens next to banks of the old \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 148 – Extended Surveillance \n \n14 \n \nCRT monitors that some of the cameras had to feed into, next to racks of \nchannel banks and a few actual, honest-to-God, computers that tried their best \nto wrestle everything into something that was almost useable. \nI found it properly overwhelming, didn’t like the place at all, but Sam actually \nseemed to get on with it pretty well, almost from the get-go. He’d apparently \nbeen an engineer back in the day, and something about all these old \nsurveillance systems all tied together, all wrapping into and around each other \nlike some weird nest of cameras, seemed to really appeal to him. The first \nweek he was there, he spent almost the entire time playing with the system \nand the wiring, left me to do most of the other work on my own. Well, I mean, \nthere were the other guys working there, of course, but even the ones who’d \nbeen there a while started to get the picture and gave Samson a bit of a wide \nberth after a few days. He really did seem to get the place in a bit of a better \norder. I mean, some of it only he really understood, but soon enough, it \nactually made sense what we were watching and when, and he’d managed to \nget rid of some of the delay so that we even managed to catch a couple of \nshoplifters. \nThere was only one piece of equipment that seemed to give him any trouble. It \nwas this old Tecton multi-camera recorder, from the late 80s, that managed \nthe feeds for one of the various budget shoe shops that lined the promenade. \nIt didn’t seem all that complicated when you just looked at it, but trying to use \nit was an absolute nightmare. None of the buttons seemed to do exactly what \nyou wanted them to do, and there were all sorts of sequences, where pressing \na button, holding a button, pressing it three times and all that, they’d all do \nreally different things. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 148 – Extended Surveillance \n \n15 \n \nSam spent almost a whole month wrestling with it, before he finally cracked \nand he asked Dave, the bearded old guy who we all sort of assumed had been \nthere the longest, whether they still had any of the old operating manuals. I \nremember the smell of dust when Dave went and cracked open the filing \ncabinet in the back room, before waving his arms in the direction of the drawer \nand shrugging. I mean, I’d have just left it, obviously, but I think Samson was \ntaking the whole knowing-how-the-system-works thing as, like, a point of \npride, something he could salvage from the whole situation. Just a way of \ngetting some control over his life, you know? \nSo, he found the manual. More of a pamphlet, really – can’t have been more \nthan ten pages of A5 in the whole thing, yellowed and water-damaged. Well-\nused, though. Someone had even put their name in the front, like they were \nafraid people were going to steal their manky instruction book. Still, Sam just \ncouldn’t put it down. I mean, it was like ten in the morning when he finally \nfound it, and when I went in at two to see if he’d taken his lunch break yet, he \nwas still sat there, just staring at it. I mean, I’m not a fast reader or anything, \nbut that’s a lot, right? And, like … Ok, so this is the part that you’re definitely \ngoing to think I’m having a joke with you, but I’m honestly not. I’m dead \nserious. Cos I saw some of the pages over his shoulder, and on one of them, \nthere was ... There was a picture of me, like a black and white photo of my \nface. I didn’t get a good look, but it certainly wasn’t one that I remember \nhaving had taken, not that that would make it any less weird for it to be \nprinted in an old CCTV manual from back when I was still in nappies. But I’m \nnot making it up, I swear. Then Samson turned and looked at me and, I don’t \nknow, I got real spooked. His eye", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 4, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 4500}}
