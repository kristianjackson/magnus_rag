I’m sorry, I didn’t... can I help you? This place is off-\nlimits. \n \nMICHAEL \nI disagree. \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nWho let you in here? \n \nMICHAEL \nLet? \n(Strange laugh) \nI’m afraid that isn’t how this works. \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG047 – The New Door \n14 \n \nYou’re him. \n \nMICHAEL \nYes. \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nMichael. \n \nMICHAEL \nThat is a real name. \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nAre you here to kill me? \n \nMICHAEL \nNo. \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nOh... why are... why are you here? \n \nMICHAEL \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG047 – The New Door \n15 \n \nI am simply collecting what is mine, Archivist. The one who enters my domain. \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nMs Richardson? You own those hallways? \n \nMICHAEL \nWhat a fascinating question. Does your hand in any way own your stomach? In \nany case, it doesn’t matter. The wanderer had a brief respite, but it’s over now. \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nWell, you’re too late. She’s... she’s gone. \n \nMICHAEL \n(Weird laugh) Yes. Did you notice which door she left through? \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nYes. It was... wait, no, there was... \n \nMICHAEL \nOh, there never has been a door there, Archivist. Your mind plays tricks on you. \n \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG047 – The New Door \n16 \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nLet her go. \n \nMICHAEL \n(Weird laugh) No. \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \n(More forcefully) Get her back here. \n \nMICHAEL \n(Weird chuckle) Are you going to attack me? \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \n(Yell of pain) Who the hell are you? \n \nMICHAEL \nI am not a who, Archivist. I am a what. A who requires a degree of identity I \ncan’t ever attain. \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nSo ‘Michael’ isn’t your real name? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG047 – The New Door \n17 \n \n \nMICHAEL \nThere is no such thing as a real name. \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nWhat are you talking about? \n \nMICHAEL \nI am talking about myself. It’s not something I’m used to doing, so I’m sorry if \nI’m not very good at it. \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nBut you’ve decided to appear down here and stab me anyway. \n \nMICHAEL \nI wanted to talk to you. I intervened to save you before. I’m... I’m interested in \nwhat happens next. \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nYes, well, thank you for that, I suppose. And you still haven’t told me why you \nintervened at all. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG047 – The New Door \n18 \n \n \nMICHAEL \nI’m normally neutral, yes, but the loss of this place would have unbalanced the \nstruggle too early. I am keen to see how it progresses. \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nYou make it sound like there’s a… war. \n \nMICHAEL \n(Chuckle) Then I will say nothing further. I wouldn’t wish to tarnish your \nignorance prematurely. Goodbye, Archivist. \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nWait! \n(Cries out in pain) \nAh! M-Michael? Michael? \nEnd recording. \n \n[CLICK] \n[The Magnus Archives Theme - Outro]", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 4, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 2885}}
