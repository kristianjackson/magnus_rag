The expression on the \npassenger’s face does not change, even as the contorting metal crushes her \nskull like an egg and she vanishes from view. He catches a glimpse of an advert \nabove his seat: DIG. \n \nThere is a door in front of him, a yellow door. He knows the dream it used to \nlead to. He knows it well. But that’s not where it leads any more. He does not \nknow what is behind it anymore, and he is deathly afraid of finding out. The \nArchivist turns away. \n \nBehind him are the ants. They move like a terrible rolling wave along the hard-\npacked ground, and he can see every twitching antenna, every clenching \nmandible. Somewhere, underneath that twitching, burrowing mass, is the \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG120 – Eye Contact \n \n5 \n \nexterminator. He is screaming. The Archivist knows he is screaming, can see \nhim screaming, although the sound it lost under the noise of those hundred \nmillion ants that crawl and scurry over everything. For a second, a hand \nbreaches the shifting mound, desperately stretched towards the Archivist in \nsupplication, pleading for help. The Archivist watches as it disappears painfully \nback into that sea of scrabbling life. Then all at once, the ants are gone, fled in \na moment away from the still shuddering form of the exterminator, and a \nfamiliar terror finally pushes its way into the Archivist’s heart. \n \nBefore him rises an incinerator door, the glowing light of the flames curling \naround the cracks. With a wailing shriek, the door opens, and the burning \nsilhouette that stands within is ingrained upon the Archivist’s racing mind. \nThey smoke and sizzle, but still the worms crawl through her charred and \npockmarked flesh, her now-singed red dress shifting with the movement \nbeneath it. The exterminator looks to her, then to the Archivist, and it is not \ncertain which he fears more. The Archivist, for his part, is hopelessly willing the \ndream to stop, but as she takes one scorched step after another, it is clear that \nhe has no power to make it. When faced with her, he even longs for the \nterrible dream of the melted woman, who would see everything desolated \nwithout rhyme or reason. But she was beyond his reach the moment she knew \nhe was there. So the Archivist can only stand and stare as the hive goes about \nits infested, long-dead work. \n \nThe dark building is newer, but he knows it well, knows the two lost souls who \ncreep through it with an alert hunger on their faces. He recognises that look \nfrom the other hunter whose dreams he has watched for so long. They stalk \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG120 – Eye Contact \n \n6 \n \nthe darkness itself and hope to catch and kill it before it can do the same to \nthem. They see him watching, but they cannot catch his scent. \n \nAt last, he is in the moonlit graveyard, the oldest of the dreams. It is peaceful, \ncool and damp as the rolling, foggy fields stretch out in all directions. He hears \nher calling pathetically from the bottom of the graves, but by now he knows \nthere is nothing he can do but stare. She begs to be released, to dream of this \nplace no more, but there is nothing he can do. So he watches her, trying in his \nsingle-minded focus to ignore the attention of that impossible thing that \ncovers the sky and fixes its gaze on him with such force it would choke him, \nwere he breathing. \n \nAnother dissection room. Another figure standing in its centre. But this one is \ncalm. She simply looks at him sadly, a pity in her face that burns him worse \nthan any flame. More than anything, the Archivist wants to look away, to turn \nhis eye from her gentle sadness, from the disappointment in what she sees in \nhim, but he cannot. So he watches her until she simply fades away. \n \nAnd at last, the Archivist looks up. At last he looks into the eye that sees all and \nknows all and clutches at the secret terrors of your heart. The ceaseless \nwatcher of all that is and all that was. The voracious infinite hunger that tears \nat his soul, invoking him to discover, to observe, to experience all and \neverything and forever. It stares into him and it stares out of him and he is \nfalling into the devouring eternity of its pupil. He wants to cry out in horror, \nbut he cannot.
