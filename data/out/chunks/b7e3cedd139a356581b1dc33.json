Help me, or you go to your little apocalypse with nothing. \nARCHIVIST \nFine. What do you want? \nGERARD \nI want to go away. I want you to take my page and burn it. \nARCHIVIST \n\nI-I-I can’t do th— They’d know! They’d kill me. \nGERARD \nTear it out and take it, then. Do it somewhere else. \nARCHIVIST \nB-B-But if they check the book— \nGERARD \nGuess you better hope they don’t. \nARCHIVIST \nGerard, please... \nGERARD \nYou want answers, you tear out my page now! So I know you can’t back out. \nARCHIVIST \n(Sigh) Okay. \nGERARD \nOkay. \nARCHIVIST \n(Exhales) Ready? \n(Gerard inhales.) \n[The sound of tearing fibres as the page is ripped out.] \nThere. \nGERARD \nThank you. \nARCHIVIST \n\nWell, you’ve probably killed me. \nGERARD \nDying isn’t so bad. It’s staying dead that sucks. \nARCHIVIST \nWell, these nuggets of wisdom are certainly worth it so far. \nGERARD \nRelax. They won’t notice. \nARCHIVIST \nSo? \nGERARD \nOkay, you got questions. \nARCHIVIST \nJust one. How do I stop the Unknowing? \nGERARD \nNo, I don’t know. \nARCHIVIST \n(Incensed) What?! \nGERARD \nOkay, okay, I don’t know exactly, but... me and Gertrude went all over, tracking \nclowns and skinwalkers, trying to find a way to mess it up. I didn’t find much, \nbut Gertrude, she figured a few things out. She reckoned it could be delayed, \nbut nothing we could do beforehand would actually stop it properly. Even the \nDancer could be replaced. But, once it starts, then it might be vulnerable. \nARCHIVIST \nVulnerable to what? \n\nGERARD \nI dunno. \nARCHIVIST \nOh, goddamn it! \nGERARD \nBut she did say she thought she had something that could do it. \nARCHIVIST \nWhat? \nGERARD \nWell, not long before I ended up in the hospital, she told me that if something \ngot her first, I was… There’s a storage unit on an industrial estate up near \nHainault. She said she rented it under the name Jan Kelly, and hid a key for it \nsomewhere in the Archives. \nARCHIVIST \nOh. Uh, I-I think I found that. \nGERARD \nWell, it’s in that storage unit. Whatever she thought might disrupt the ritual, \nstop the Unknowing, that’s where it’ll be. \nARCHIVIST \nBut you don’t know what it is? \nGERARD \nNo. When I asked her she said she’d show me when we got back to London. \nMind you, she had this weird look in her eyes, like it was some kind of a joke. \nARCHIVIST \nI mean... it wasn’t, w-was it? A-A joke. \n\nGERARD \nI don’t think so. Gertrude didn’t make jokes. \nARCHIVIST \nWell, worst case scenario I suppose I… continue to have nothing. \nGERARD \nI guess. So… uh, you’re the Archivist now? \nARCHIVIST \nWhatever that means. \nGERARD \nCan’t help you much there. Gertrude was always kind of cagey about it. \nARCHIVIST \nSh-She never showed any... er, abilities, or talked about... I don’t know, \ndestiny? Like she was… becoming something? \nGERARD \nHmmm... Well, she could make people tell her stuff, sometimes. They’d \nsuddenly get real talkative, and lay out whatever she needed. She didn’t do it \noften though. I don’t think she liked it. \nARCHIVIST \nOh, er, I can do that, too. \nGERARD \nHuh. Do you like it? \nARCHIVIST \nI-I don’t know. I never really thought about it. Yes, I… I suppose I do. \nGERARD \n\nHmmm. \nARCHIVIST \nDid she read statements? \nGERARD \nSometimes. If she was getting shaky. They perked her up, I think. Feeding the \nEye, you know? I’d sometimes hear her through the wall, just reading into the \nair, feeling it all. \nARCHIVIST \nShe… she didn’t use a tape recorder? \nGERARD \nNot when I was with her. She travelled light. Left things behind. \nARCHIVIST \nKind of sounds like you didn’t… trust her. \nGERARD \nYeah, I didn’t. I wanted to, I really did, but it was always the work. Sometimes \nshe just reminded me of my mum. Did you ever meet her, my mum? \nARCHIVIST \n(Flustered) Erm… Not in, not in person, it was er... O-Only by reputation. \nGERARD \nHuh. Well, she was also, um, ‘goal-orientated’. Ruthless. But at least Gertrude \ntried to do something worthwhile with it. My mum only had her ambitions. \nShe’d never have even admitted it, though. She was too proud for that. She \nsaw herself as real working class, always said the occult was just a club for rich \nboys playing politics with things they didn’t understand. Reckoned her \ntradition was less the academic and more the, uh... \nARCHIVIST", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 1, "chunk_count": 9, "chars": 4251}}
