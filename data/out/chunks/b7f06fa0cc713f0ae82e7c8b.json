I \nnever forced her to be there. I never did that. \nWe'd done some of the Three Counties cave system before – a short trip of \nonly a couple of hours into the Rift Pot caves. The whole system is huge, \nthough, I mean there's a reason it's called the Three Counties System, so there \nwas plenty more to explore and we'd had so much fun the first time that I \nwanted to try it from a different angle. We were going to go in through the \nDeath's Head Hole, then travelling through Lost John's Cave as far as Gavel Pot \nbefore heading back. The prospect of this excited me, as in order to travel \nbetween Lost John's Cave and the Gavel Pot system we were going to have to \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG015 – Lost John’s Cave \n3 \n \ndo some cave diving. I had never done cave diving before, and neither had \nAlena, although she told me that the prospect spooked her less than some of \nthe squeezes we'd had to do get there. \nWe made all the arrangements, got our permits in order with the CNCC and \nhad my husband Alistair note down all the details in case anything went wrong. \nYou never go caving unless someone knows where you're headed and what \nyour plan is. I had also done as much research into our route as possible as I \nhad no intention of straying from the well-explored, thoroughly-charted caves. \nI was never much of a pioneer if I'm being honest and I was happy to stay to \nthe main routes. No, what I used to love about caving was the feeling of being \ndeep inside the earth; the cold, solid walls folding in around me. It always used \nto feel like they were keeping me safe though it doesn't feel like that anymore. \nIt was Saturday June 14th we went. I had taken the Friday before off work to \nprepare, and was planning to spend Sunday nursing well-earned bruises. Alena \nand I drove up to Lancashire, towards Death's Head Hole. I live in Manchester \nso it wasn't too long a trip. We parked up at Leck Fell, the closest you could \nlegally park. I was surprised to see that we were the only ones there when we \narrived. It was a sunny day in late spring and the weather was meant to be \nclear for days, with no chance of rain making the caves too dangerous. It was a \nperfect day for caving but it seemed we were the only ones taking advantage \nof it \nDeath's Head Hole is not nearly as impressive or intimidating as its name \nsuggests. If you didn't know what you were looking for, you might end up \nmissing it entirely. When we went, much of it was covered in wild plants and \nbracken. It was barely larger than we were, and I remember at the time the \nphrase “a perfect fit” came into my head unbidden. Still, the resin anchors \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG015 – Lost John’s Cave \n4 \n \nwere in good condition and we hooked up and descended our ropes without \nincident, despite a few unexpected twists in the pothole. It was a bright day; it \nwas almost noon when we went down, so the light filtered a lot further in that \nI would have expected. It was some time before we had to turn on our \nheadlamps, but eventually we did so. By the time we hit the bottom, there was \nnone of that sunshine left to be seen and the silent darkness of the cave \nswallowed us. Beneath our feet the gentle waters of the underground stream \nran their course, as they had for thousands of years, undisturbed by the rough \ntread of humanity, and we followed them. It was a much gentler descent than \nthat which we had come in with, but it was very slippery, and I was glad I had \ninvested in a waterproof map case, although it made it slightly harder to read \nat times. \nAlena stood back to let me have my ritual. There was something I always did \nwhen I first entered a cave, and that was to take a moment to turn off all the \nlights, and place both my hands upon the cold, earthen walls. I remember \nonce, when I was a child, we went on a school trip to White Scar Cave up in \nYorkshire. It was a lovely, safe, accessible cave and was absolutely beautiful, \nwhich I suppose is why it was popular for such trips. After we’d been down \nthere for a few minutes, the guide led us much deeper, and told us to stand \nvery quietly. She turned off the lights, to show us children what true darkness \nis like. I’d never seen anything like it. It was such a pure black, so \nencompassing, and in the warmth of the underground I found myself full of a \njoy I’ve never forgotten. Even among a class of thirty schoolchildren, I felt like \nthe only presence that mattered was the cave. Ever sin", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 1, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 4500}}
