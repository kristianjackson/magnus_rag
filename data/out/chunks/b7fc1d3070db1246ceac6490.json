Statement \ngiven direct, 2nd September 2016. Statement, uh... Statement begins. \nJONATHAN SIMS \nI’ve been going into the tunnels. It’s.... There are, uh... Jane Prentiss is dead. I \nknow this. I have a small jar on my desk of what are supposed to be her ashes, \nthough I don’t believe it for a second. I think Martin just gave me a jar of dust \nto try and calm me down. Give me something to focus on for closure. I hate to \nsay it, but it does appear to be working. A victory for the placebo effect, it \nwould seem. But that’s beside the point. The worms have been cleared and \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG041 – Too Deep \n2 \n \nincinerated, the floors and walls repaired, and the archive looks remarkably \nlike it was never attacked at all. \nUnlike me. I’ve healed enough in the last month to return to work, but I’m told \nit’s unlikely the scars will ever truly fade. Tim is still signed off. Truth be told I \ncould have stayed away longer, probably should have, but I don’t think the \nboredom was good for me. I tried to come back earlier, but Martin wouldn’t \nhear of it. Almost threw me out of the archive. Is he hiding something? Heh. \nNo, of course not. He’s probably just legitimately concerned for my health. \nWhy do I still feel like I’m being watched? I’d just about convinced myself it \nwas Prentiss, watching me in secret while she filled the walls with her writhing \nhordes, but no. She is dead and gone, and still whenever I talk into this… damn \nthing, I feel this... I’m being watched. I know I am. I’d think it was some aspect \nof the recorder itself, but it still happens even when I’m just reading these files. \nNot as strongly as when I’m… recording them, perhaps, but still there. Is it... \nHuh. You know, I always despised those witnesses who rambled on, unable to \nstay on topic, couldn’t give as concise a statement. Yet here I am, mumbling \nmy vague suspicions of being watched, and completely ignoring the reason I’m \nmaking a statement of my own. I have been exploring the tunnels. \nIt’s been a couple of weeks now. From before I was officially back. If you listen \nto this, Martin, I am sorry. I’ve gone behind your back to explore the tunnels \non… several occasions. I took the key from Elias’ desk some time ago. I don’t \nthink he noticed. Since Martin stopped living in the Archives, I’ve had ample \nopportunities for exploration by night. Part of me still wonders if going down \nthere after dark was more dangerous, but the pitch black of those tunnels \nwould be no different in the daytime. The only light down there is what you \nbring yourself.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 0, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 3223}}
