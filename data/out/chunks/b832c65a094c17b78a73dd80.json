Over and over again, until I felt like I was \nalmost in a trance. \nIt was the silence that finally brought me back to myself. I was waiting for the \nnext in the line of cattle to be herded into the room, and I noticed that I \ncouldn’t hear anything. There wasn’t the scared lowing of the animals, the far-\noff whine of saws or the rumble of any one of the hundreds of machines that \nhum and churn to keep the abattoir running. I waited and waited, but no more \ncows came. Looking around I couldn’t see anyone. There was no clock in that \nroom, nor did I wear a watch. A buzzer would usually sound when breaks rolled \naround, and I hadn’t heard anything. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG030 – Killing Floor \n6 \n \nNo more cattle seemed to be coming, so I put down the bolt gun, and walked \nover towards the bleeding area. There was nobody there, and more than that, \nthe place looked clean. Spotless. As though no blood had ever been spilled \nthere. Had I stood there, passed out or something? Had the day ended and the \nplace been cleaned and I hadn’t even noticed? \nI headed towards the exit door, deciding that I’d either find someone to ask \nwhat was happening, or I’d just go home. The door opened onto a corridor that \nI didn’t recognise. It looked like any other corridor in the slaughterhouse, \nexcept that it wasn’t the one that lead towards the exit. I went to try the other \ndoors that lead out of the killing floor, but none of them went to the places I \nremembered them going. Behind each was another hallway that seemed to \nlead deeper into the abattoir. I stood there for a few moments, and I genuinely \npinched myself. I had to be dreaming or hallucinating or something. It wasn’t a \ndream, though, or a vision. Everything had changed, and I was somewhere \nnew. \nI surprised myself a bit with how quickly I accepted this situation. I went out \nthe door I originally went towards, thinking that if I didn’t know the layout of \nthis building, then I might as well start by trying to follow the old route out as \nmuch I could. The corridors just seemed to lead into each other, though, and \nsoon I was completely lost. I did notice, though, that some of them appeared \nto have rails along the top, like those used to move the hanging carcasses. \nSome of them even had hooks on, shiny and clean. These rails would never \nnormally follow the passages of the slaughterhouse like this, and that fact \nbothered me, though I’m not quite sure why. \nI called out, at least at first, hoping that there was someone, somewhere in this \nmaze, who might hear me and answer. There was nothing. Some doors led into \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG030 – Killing Floor \n7 \n \nempty rooms, containing only still clean machinery. Meat-bone separators, \nsplitting saws, scald tanks, each standing there, shining and silent. Waiting. I \ndidn’t hang around long in those rooms. As I said, I don’t wear a watch, so I \ndon’t know how long I wandered. It felt like hours, though. \nEventually, I turned a corner to see a small, metal staircase spiralling upwards. \nI had no reason to think I was below ground level at all, but it was the first \nthing I had found that wasn’t just twisting corridors and silent rooms, so I went \nup. The stairs curved upwards for a very long time. \nWhen I reached the next floor, my heart sank to see more corridors stretching \naway from me, though these ones all had the meat rails snaking along the \nceilings, and many of them were unlit. I stayed out of the darker passages. One \nof them had a window looking out, and all I could see outside was a metal \nabattoir roof stretching away to the horizon. The sky was a dull pink – the \ncolour of blood being washed into a drain. I left the window very quickly. \nFinally, by complete chance, I noticed a door I recognised. It was the dark \ngreen exit door that should lead out of the building. I didn’t even stop to \nconsider that it might not lead outside; I just opened it and stepped through. \nMy feet didn’t land on the tarmac of the outside. They didn’t land on the \nconcrete or metal or tile of the slaughterhouse floor, either. It was dark, so I \ndidn’t immediately realise what I was treading on, except that it shifted slightly \nunder my weight. I looked to either side, and saw the metal barriers penning \nme in, and the conveyor belt beneath me began to move. I realised where I \nwas, where it would lead, and I screamed. \nTurning to run, I almost expected a horde of cattle behind me, pre", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 3, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 4500}}
