Whether he was \nBritish or American or even French, it means nothing. What matters, is that at \nthe Battle of Bunker Hill he found himself alone. \nThe night before had been wasted hard carousing, and what money he had not \nlost betting on faro had quickly been spent on drinking and pleasant company. \nSo it was that he took to the field of battle with his head already swimming and \neyes a stinging red. He had neglected even to bring gunpowder enough to \nreload his rifle, having filled his pouch instead with playing cards, and with \nevery boom of the cannon the soldier's head pulsed in such pain that he \nthought himself sho \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG029 – Cheating Death \n3 \n \nThe smoke was coiled thick around him and the acrid stench of gunpowder and \nblood made him retch. He fired his one and only shot and it disappeared into \nthe roiling fog of war. He tried to advance, but he did not know which way was \ntowards the enemy, nor could he see any others amidst the chaos of battle, \nenemy or comrade. For all the muskets and cannons he could hear, it seemed \nhe was alone. As he stood there, the soldier saw that some of the blood that \nfell into the sodden soil was his own. When he had been shot, he had no idea, \nbut the pain that surged through him as touched his wounded chest left no \ndoubt. \nThe bold soldier considered returning to his lines, to find a doctor, but he \nremembered all too clearly the mouldering filth of the medical tents, the ranks \nof infected fools wailing out their last doomed cries. He would not die like that. \nHe would not choke out some feeble plea for his mother in some \ngrimeencrusted infirmary. He turned, threw down his rifle, and began to run. \nHe did not know in which direction he was going, and simply prayed that it was \nnot towards the enemy or the sea. Blood flowed freely from the ragged wound \nin his chest, and his breathing was laboured, yet he pushed on. He ran until the \nmud turned to soil and the soil turned to grass, until the smoke turned to fog \nand the fog turned to rain, and dusk came upon him. \nDespite the balmy warmth of that June day, the night was bitterly cold. \nPerhaps it was the rain that pounded upon his tunic, or maybe it was the \nbeginnings of a fever, but when the soldier finally stopped running, he was so \nchilled that it took all the energy he had left in him not to collapse. He was \nsoaked through, shivering violently, and very aware that if he did not find \nsomewhere to take shelter from the elements, he was going to die. And not a \nquick, clean death from a pistol or a sabre. A miserable, shivering death in \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG029 – Cheating Death \n4 \n \nsome barren field near Boston. The soldier, whose boldness seemed to seep \nout with his blood, did not want to die. \nAnd here there is something to be said on death. Everyone fears death. Of \ncourse they do. Even the most devout must have some apprehension, for \nhowever confident they are in a life everlasting with their deity of choice, the \nconcept of eternity is one that the mortal mind recoils from. Be it bliss, \ntorment or the senseless void, none can actually imagine what it is to die, so \nit's only right that all should have a healthy fear of it. There are some, though, \nfor whom it is an enduring terror. Who cannot even consider the inevitable \ntermination of life without a deepest panic, and can think of nothing in life that \ncould be worse than its end. The soldier was of this cloth, and upon feeling his \ntime drawing to a close, he began to cast about in fear. \nHe spied a farmhouse, dark and uninviting. The fighting nearby had likely \nscared off whoever lived there. Desperate to get out of the pouring rain, the \nsoldier tried the doors, and found them locked tight. He broke a window, but \nwith his wound he did not have to strength to climb inside. In despair, he \nlooked around himself for another entrance and spied the cellar door. It was \nnot locked, and lifted with surprising ease, given how heavy the wood \nappeared. He collapsed inside, half-crawling, half-falling down the rough \nearthen steps, until he found himself lying there in the dark, dry warmth of the \nbasement. \nThe soldier lay there for some time, unmoving, eyes shut. Listening to the \ndriving New England rain beating down outside. He breathed deeply, ignoring \nthe pain from his wounded chest, and tried to gather his thoughts.
