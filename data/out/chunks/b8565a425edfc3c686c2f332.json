The story of the psychology student who went mad during an \nESP study is still widely discussed in certain quarters of Surrey University, and \nthere are multiple newspaper articles covering the events in depth, though \nnone of them mention the, uh, arachnid angle, or indeed Mr Harlow’s \ninvolvement. Both Mark Voight and Dr Elizabeth Bates left the University \nalmost immediately following the incident under something of a cloud. \nDr Bates has refused our request for an interview point-blank, while Martin \ninforms me that Mr Voight’s testimony was disjointed and borderline \nincomprehensible. \n\nApparently, biologically, his account of the spiders doesn’t make any sense \naccording to Martin. Also, apparently, he cried a lot. \nHe did, however, at least confirm the presence of Mr Harlow at the event, and \nthe rest of the conversation was a mess of rambling about legs and scuttling. \nDespite his recent issues, Tim came through on this one. Police reports do \nsupport the official story of a student who suffered a violent episode and \nattacked other people involved in a research study. It was ascribed to a \npsychotic attack, though Annabelle Cane’s parents have repeatedly stated she \nhad no history of mental illness or violence. \nIndeed, I’ve rarely seen so blatant a use of the image of a frothing lunatic \noutside the pages of lurid fiction. \nI do not think she went mad. \nAnnabelle Cane has never been apprehended and appears to all intents and \npurposes to have disappeared. What is equally, if not more concerning, is that \nin the years since that statement, every one of the other participants in that \nstudy, Dr Bates’ so-called “projectors”, have also disappeared. I cannot help \nbut wonder how many cobwebs might be found in their old homes. \nEnd recording. \n[Tape clicks off. Tape clicks on.] \nSupplemental. \nI, uh, I’ve not been back in the tunnels. I find myself... let’s call it what it is – I’m \nscared. Especially after last week’s abortive exploration. And yet, every other \nlead seems to have dried up or given more questions without resolving \nanything, and short of confronting Elias with what I’ve found or waiting in the \n\nunlikely hope of more tapes from Basira, I am struggling to settle on any plan \nthat doesn’t take me down into those tunnels. Down to find something that \nhas made very clear that it does not want to be found. I should ask the others \nfor help but I… I can’t. At best, they’d just try to talk me out of it. At worst… \nNo, I… if I’m going down there, I go alone. I should just leave it. They’re right. \nBut I can’t not know.
