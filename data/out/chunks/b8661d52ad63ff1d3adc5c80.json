As I went in, I noticed the dust \nin here wasn’t as thick as in the rest of the house, and that the last entry \nmarked on his desktop calendar was the 12th of February. Empty food packets \nand bottles were strewn about the room and piled up in the corner. It looked \nas though Robin hadn’t left his bedroom in weeks. The rancid odour that I’d \ncaught wind of outside was stronger in here, and I no longer thought it was \ncoming from the fridge. \nSlowly and carefully I made my way towards the wardrobe. It was a stark, \nimposing thing: a good two feet taller than I was. The smell was making my \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG086 – Tucked In \n10 \n \neyes water, but I pushed through. Even if I knew what I was going to find \ninside, I felt like I had to open it, if only so I could accurately describe it to the \npolice. So that’s what I did. I gripped the ice-cold brass handle, took as deep a \nbreath as I could endure, and opened the door to the closet. \nThe shape that slid out did not, at first, resemble anything I would have called \nhuman. It looked like a large, wet bag, glistening and slick, with a dark liquid \nthat oozed from it onto the floor. I won’t even try to describe the smell. It was \nonly when I saw a shrivelled, nearly skeletal hand gripping the edge of the bag \nfrom the inside that I realised what I was actually looking at. \nIt was Robin, but when he had climbed into that cupboard he had taken the \nsheets from his bed. He had wrapped them tightly around himself as he sat in \nthere, clutching them in what I can only assume was mortal terror. And now, in \ndeath, they had fused to him, his own putrefying fluids mixing with whatever \ngross liquid had soaked into that thick fabric. How long had he sat there \nwaiting? Hours? Days? Had it been since the 12th, two weeks before I had \ncome to check on him? \nAnd as I stood there, in utter horror, the growing pool of dark liquid touched \nthe tip of my shoe. That’s it. That’s the moment that I believe it started for me. \nI don’t know why particularly that moment fixates me, that there must have \nbeen dozens of other ways I called attention to myself. But even so, whenever \nI look back, I cannot shake the conviction that it was that moment I sealed my \nfate. Because I didn’t watch where I put my feet. \nI called the police at that point. They were very understanding, although once \na search turned up nothing they didn’t pay any attention to my insistence \nsomeone else had been in the house. For all the strangeness of it, there didn’t \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG086 – Tucked In \n11 \n \nseem to be any actual evidence of foul play, so I was really just offered some \ncondolences, and sent on my way. They were the ones that called Robin’s \nmother in the end, and to be honest I’m glad. I don’t really think I could have \nhandled that conversation. \nAnd then it was over. Nothing for me to do but go home, and try to process \nwhat I was feeling, what I had seen in that dusty bungalow. And I thought I was \ndoing okay. At least while the daylight held. But that night it came for me. \nI woke up at 2:40 in the morning. I don’t know why. There was no sound to \ndisturb me, just a sudden and urgent need to no longer be sleeping. And as I \nopened my eyes I felt that old fear of the dark hit me again with such force my \nmuscles began to seize up. I raised my head just enough to get a clear view of \nthe door to my room, and I saw what I somehow knew I was going to see. \nIt was impossible to make out any details of the form that stood in the \ndoorway, it was simply a patch of shadow even darker than the night that \nsurrounded it. A silhouette in the pitch black. At first I thought it was a trick of \nmy eyes adjusting to the dark, but then it began to move. Its body was fat and \nbulbous, with no limbs or head, so when it came towards me it did so with a \nslow, undulating pulse along the floor. I could see its outside was covered in \nwhat might have been feelers or fleshy tubes, and as it gradually made its way \ntowards me I could see them flicking out and spasming wildly, in what looked \nhorribly like excitement. \nInstinct, honed throughout my entire childhood, kicked in and I pulled the thick \nblanket I was under up and over my head. I gripped the edges close to my \nchest, weeping and muttering desperate prayers.
