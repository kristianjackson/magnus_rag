Teeth. Wet, blunt teeth, which quickly gave way to a rough, slender \ntongue that wrapped itself around my hand and snaked up my arm, as though \ntasting me. \nThen, without warning I felt it snap back into the darkness, taking some of the \nskin with it, and my arm was abruptly released. \nThe next thing I remember I was lying in bed. I want to say I had just woken up \nand it was all a dream, but I was fully dressed, dusty, and with long, thin \nscratches that snaked around my arm. \nThat was when I started desperately looking for a way to leave Bucoda. I’d \nbeen there for just over a month by this point, and had managed to find a part-\n\ntime job over in the nearby town, Chehalis. The pay wasn’t great, but it should \nhave been just about enough to move out if I was careful. Tommy was upset, \nof course, but didn’t seem surprised – that month had been a bit tense, and we \nweren’t particularly well-suited to living together anyway. I suppose that’s \nwhat you get for moving in with strangers you meet in a bar. \nIt was the night before I left that it happened. 17th June 2008. I’d got all my \nthings boxed up and ready to go. I had the keys to my new place. All I had to do \nwas get one more good night’s sleep. \nInstead I was woken up about two in the morning by the sound of the front \ndoor closing. I called out, but Tommy didn’t respond. I searched the house to \nmake sure no-one had broken in, but the place was empty. I was alone. \nTommy’s business was his own, I decided, and was about to return to bed \nwhen I saw a shadow pass by the window. Then another. I quietly moved to \nthe door and pushed it open, looking out into the street to see if I could figure \nout what was going on. \nThere aren’t a lot of street lights in Bucoda, and at night, when all the houses \nare dark it can get very eerie indeed. I was close enough to see the figures \nmoving down the road, though. They walked casually, like they were just going \nfor a stroll, but there were a lot of them. Maybe the whole town. Walking out \nof their houses and trailers, and down the unlit streets. I knew exactly where \nthey were going, and I just couldn’t stop myself following them. \nI don’t know how the whole town was able to get inside the pit. There must \nhave been hundreds of them, piled high, and encrusted with mud. They did not \nmove, though their eyes shone so brightly in my torch that they must have \nbeen alive. None of them made a sound, though I could feel a warmth and \nshuddering below my feet, as though the earth itself was screaming. \nWithout warning one of their heads snapped towards me. It was a young \nwoman who had lived the next road over, and whose name I had never \nlearned. She stared at me, eyes suddenly alive with terror, and began to \nscream. The instant she did, she disappeared, pulled into the ground, cutting \nthe sound off before it had even begun. I turned and ran, back to the house. I \nwanted to drive away, but I couldn’t bear to be outside. So I hid, under my bed \nthe rest of the night, and felt the ground rock gently beneath me.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 5, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 3113}}
