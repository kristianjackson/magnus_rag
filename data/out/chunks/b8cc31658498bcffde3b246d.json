No! \n \nARCHIVIST \nMartin, just... You can do more good here. \n \nMARTIN \nWhat, sat around drinking tea until the world ends? Or, you know, it doesn’t. \n \nBASIRA \nWe hope. \n \nARCHIVIST \nMelanie’s not coming either. I think... I think she’ll need you here. \n \nMARTIN \nFine. \n \nELIAS \nGlad that’s sorted. Now, unless there’s anything else? \n \nARCHIVIST \nNot if, uh... No. \n \nELIAS \nExcellent. Well, it’s a three hour trip up to Great Yarmouth. I had Rosie book \nyou all into a bed and breakfast near the museum. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG116 – The Show Must Go On \n \n18 \n \n \nARCHIVIST \nRight. \n \nELIAS \nOh and, John, technically I can’t stop you, but I would heavily advise against \nbringing any... rogue elements. \n \nMARTIN \nYou can just say Tim. \n \nARCHIVIST \nI will take it under advisement. \n \nELIAS \nHmm. Anyway, don’t worry about staying in contact; I’ll know when it starts. \n \nARCHIVIST \nNaturally. \n \nELIAS \nThat reminds me, make sure you keep any receipts for expenses. Assuming you \nwish to claim them back. \n \nARCHIVIST \nAnd assuming we don’t... you know, die. \n \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG116 – The Show Must Go On \n \n19 \n \nELIAS \nYes. If you die, I’m afraid you probably won’t be able to claim your expenses. \nNow, if you’ll excuse me. \n \n(Elias leaves, closes door behind him) \n \n(Everyone exhales) \n \nBASIRA \nDo you think he bought it? \n \nMARTIN \n(Urgently) We’ll talk about it later. \n \nARCHIVIST \nI doubt there’ll be time; we need to go. \n \nMARTIN \nIt’s fine. We’ve got this. Ok? \n \nARCHIVIST \n(Reluctant) Okay. \n \nDAISY \nCome on. \n \nBASIRA \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG116 – The Show Must Go On \n \n20 \n \nYeah... Sure. \n \n(Click) \n \n(Click) \n \nTIM \nSo? \n \nARCHIVIST \nHe doesn’t want you there. \n \nTIM \nAnd you? \n \nARCHIVIST \nI... would rather have you where I can see you. \n \nTIM \nGood. \n \nARCHIVIST \nYou listen to the tape? \n \nTIM \nYup, sounds like fun. \n \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG116 – The Show Must Go On \n \n21 \n \nARCHIVIST \nDo I need to be worried about you? \n \nTIM \nYou reading my mind again, boss? \n \nARCHIVIST \nI’m watching your face. Do you— Are you going to keep it together? \n \nTIM \nLook, if you’re worried I’m going to go all Redrum and start hacking at random \nwaxworks, don’t be. I’m not going to give us away. I want this to work. \n \nARCHIVIST \nThank you. \n \nTIM \nBut I don’t think it will. So, I’m going to take that axe of yours and, when it all \ngoes wrong, I’m going down swinging. And when I do, you’d better take the \nchance and stay out of my way. \n \nARCHIVIST \n(Sighing) Okay, just...
