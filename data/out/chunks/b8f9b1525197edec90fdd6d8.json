The tapes, were yo— \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 162 – A Cosy Cabin \n30 \n[Hissing static ends] \nARCHIVIST \nI, I was listening, and, i-it, it was the one with Tim and, and Sasha, uh, where \nthey’re— \nMARTIN \nYeah, y-yeah. (soft) Yeah. Look, John, I-I know it hurts, but you’ve just got to— \nARCHIVIST \nNo, no— O,Oka— I, I was listening, and I, I was filled with this... hatred. This \nanger; I, I wanted to leave and hunt down Elias, uh, and— \nMARTIN \nUh- w,wow, okay. \nARCHIVIST \nBut when I thought it, th-there was, there was something else. \n[The safehouse creaks] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nTh-This place, it- it didn’t want me — it didn’t want us — to go. \nMARTIN \nWhat do you mean? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 162 – A Cosy Cabin \n31 \nARCHIVIST \nThis cabin. It’s not right. And when I thought that, I-I felt— It, it all poured out \nof me, down into the tape. I, I, I- and it— felt good. I-It felt right. \nMARTIN \nOkay. \n(Beat) \nSo you’re recording again? \nARCHIVIST \nI- I might need to. If we’re going to make it. \nMARTIN \n(Surprised) Back to the Archives? \nARCHIVIST \nSeems the best place to start. \nMARTIN \nOh- (surprised exhale) Y,yeah, alright! \nARCHIVIST \nMartin, it’s going to be a hard journey. One in which w— \nMARTIN \n(Fast) Yeah, yeah, yeah, so, I’ve actually had a couple of bags packed for a \nwhile now. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 162 – A Cosy Cabin \n32 \nARCHIVIST \nOh! \n[Martin starts getting out the bags, and as the conversation \ncontinues, he begins packing and sorting items into them] \nMARTIN \nUm, I found some rope in the attic— \nARCHIVIST \n(Crosstalk) Okay— \nMARTIN \n(Crosstalk) —and I packed that with the maps. \nARCHIVIST \n(Smiling) Uh, Martin- \nMARTIN \nNo, no, no; I- I know what you’re going to say, (John impression) What good \nare maps when the very Earth has... eh, blah blah blah. \nARCHIVIST \nW,w,well yes. \nMARTIN \n—But I, I packed them anyway, because you never. Know. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 162 – A Cosy Cabin \n33 \nARCHIVIST \n(Fond) Martin. \nMARTIN \nI- I actually — heh — I actually found a stash of tea under the kitchen sink- I-I \nrealize we don’t need to eat, or whatever, but, you know, that doesn’t mean \nthat we won’t— \nARCHIVIST \n(Fond) Yes- Yes, yes, it- alright. Alright. \nMARTIN \nWe’ve got this. \n[Martin puts another item in a bag] \nARCHIVIST \n(Smiling) Apparently so. \nMARTIN \nD’you think it’ll do anything? Confronting Elias? \nARCHIVIST \nI- (sigh) Maybe? \nMARTIN \nNo, I’m serious- Do we- \n[The sound of bags being packed pauses] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 162 – A Cosy Cabin \n34 \nMARTIN (CONT’D) \nIs there a chance that we can undo this? \nARCHIVIST \nGertrude didn’t think so. \n \n(Beat) \nMARTIN \nRight. \nARCHIVIST \nBut she’s dead. Let’s find out for ourselves. \n[Bag packing recommences] \nMARTIN \nYou’re- taking the recorder? \nARCHIVIST \nUh, just in case I need to- vent. Again, it— (inhale) it helps. \nMARTIN \n(Heavy breath) Okay. \nMARTIN (CONT’D) \nYou said this place— the, the cabin was— it, it’s feeding on us, right? \nARCHIVIST \nYes. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 162 – A Cosy Cabin \n35 \nMARTIN \nSo, should we destroy it? Before we go? \n[The cabin creaks very loudly] \nARCHIVIST \nI honestly don’t know if we can. \nMARTIN \nMm. \nARCHIVIST \nBesides, there’s far worse out there. Better to try and avoid it, I think. \nMARTIN \nWe’re not even gonna try? Look, we’ve got your lighter; maybe if we just— \nARCHIVIST \nWe can’t fight the world, Martin. \n(A little breath of a laugh from The Archivist) \nMARTIN \nSays you. \nARCHIVIST \nLet’s go. \n[Martin and the Archivist grab the bags] \n[Tape clicks off]", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 6, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 3562}}
