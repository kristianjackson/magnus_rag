He has his own \nlife to lead and is living with his fiancée at the moment, so I can’t just ask him \nto move back in with his dad. I tried to set up some cameras in the upstairs \nhallway, at the top of the stairs and outside my room, but they show nothing. \nThey don’t even pick up the door handle turning, even at times I know for \ncertain that the thing was trying to get inside. There was only one moment, \njust a frame or two, I think, where the shadows the camera caught on the wall \nseemed almost to form a face. It seemed to be leering at me, the mouth wide \nopen in a mock scream. It scared me so badly that I had to delete the footage. I \nhave no evidence for the police. Or for you either, I suppose. \nI guess that’s why I’m here. This is what you people do. You investigate these \nthings. You know what to look for and can identify the signs of things that... \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG027 – A Sturdy Lock \n7 \n \naren’t right. You know, not of this world. I’m not saying it’s a ghost or anything \nlike that, it’s just… that well, if it was a ghost, you’d be the ones to talk to, \nright? I just need it to stop. And I don’t want to be put in a home. I know they \nwill, if I keep telling them about how my door handle rattles and turns every \nnight, they’ll think I’m senile and useless and send me to a home, and I will not \nlet that happen. It’s my house, and I don’t care how much it scares me, nothing \nis going to make me give it up. Maybe Marcus is right. Maybe I should get a \ndog. \nJONATHAN SIMS \nStatement ends. \nI want to believe Mr. McKenzie, I really do. I am not entirely made of stone, \nand am apt to be moved by the plea of a scared old man as much as anybody. I \nmean, dementia is, of course, the most likely explanation, and he admits \nhimself that he has no proof of any of it. Yet part of me still wants to believe \nhim. Perhaps this job is making me sentimental. \nIn any case it’s a moot point. Mr. McKenzie died of a stroke some two months \nafter making this statement, and there doesn’t seem to be any obvious \nconnection between his passing and his statement to the Institute. When this \nwas originally logged, apparently we did send a then-member of the research \nstaff, one Sarah Carpenter, to take some readings of the house. Apparently she \nfelt there was little enough danger to justify an overnight vigil at the place, but \nlike everyone else in Mr. McKenzie’s tale, she encountered no strangeness or \nintruders on the upstairs landing, or in any other part of the building. \nSasha, who has now returned after her brief convalescence, has confirmed the \ncall outs against police reports and they appear to match, though obviously", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 3, "chunk_count": 5, "chars": 2722}}
