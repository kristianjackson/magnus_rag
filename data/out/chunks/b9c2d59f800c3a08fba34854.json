The flat she mentioned did belong to \nMr Folger, but was sold through an agency in early 2007. All the photographs \nwe’ve been able to source seem to match the description of this “Not-Graham” \nthat Ms. Patel described, except for a few Polaroids, enclosed, which appear \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG003 – Across The Street \n13 \n \nto be from the late 80s, and show the two parents alongside a dark-haired \nteenager who doesn’t match the later photos at all. \nThere doesn’t seem to be much more to be done here. Ms. Patel, like so many \nof our subjects, seems to have been more interested in giving her statement as \na form of personal closure, rather than as the start of a serious investigation. \nShe wasn’t even interested when Sasha told her we’d managed to locate what \nwe believed to be one of Graham Folger’s journals. Doubt it would have done \nmuch good. It just says the same thing on every page: the words “Keep \nWatching” over and over again. \n \nRecording ends \n[The Magnus Archives Theme - Outro] \n \nThe Magnus Archives is a podcast distributed by Rusty Quill and licensed under \na creative commons attribution, non-commercial share alike 4.0 international \nlicense.
