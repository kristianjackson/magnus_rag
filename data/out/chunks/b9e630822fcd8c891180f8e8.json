Greg didn’t answer the door, but it wasn’t locked. \nThe house was still spotless, but the cleanliness didn’t look quite as fresh as it \nhad before. Like it had been cleaned earlier, and just hadn’t been used since \nthen. My father-in-law was sat on the sofa in the same clothes he’d had on the \nlast time I’d seen him. His skin was slick with sweat, and his face was blank. I \ncalled out to him and he looked up, but there was… no recognition in his eyes. \nI glanced behind him, and saw the bathroom door was closed. Not just closed, \nbut sealed. All the edges and the cracks had been packed through with sealant. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG093 – Contaminant \n7 \n \nHe’d even nailed extra wood to the bottom of the door, and sealed all the \ncrevices of that. It didn’t do anything to stop that sour smell, which seemed to \npulse and ooze from the doorway, and as I stared at the edges of it, I noticed \nthe sealant was laced through with thin tendrils of purple. \nI turned to Greg to say something, to ask a question, but then… I noticed \nsomething. I began to realise that, aside from his head, every inch of skin was \ncovered with clothes, with gloves, or a scarf. Whereas before he had been \ndressing to be sterile, now it seemed like he was dressing to keep covered. And \nthen I looked into his face. I saw the thin crust of purple around his eyelids, the \ncorner of his mouth, and the colour of veins in his bloodshot eyes. \nHe started to move, to open his mouth, but I didn’t give him the chance. I \ndidn’t even stop to consider alternatives, I just turned on my heel and ran. \nSome people might call me a coward, but I am absolutely sure those people \nwould not have made it out of that house alive. \nI know I should have called someone, told the police or the ambulance service, \nbut I was in shock. I didn’t know what I’d just witnessed. I still don’t, not really. \nI went back one more time, but I didn’t even get past the front gate before the \nsmell hit me, and I turned back. It looked like my father-in-law was moving, \nthough. I remember, it was Breekon and Hope doing it; they had a depot a \nways down the street, and I recall thinking how odd that was, using a couple of \nlocal lads with such a small van, given how much furniture they were having to \nload up from Greg’s house. I asked them about it, about where he was, but \nthey just looked at each other and mumbled something in Polish or Russian, \nand then they completely ignored me. I was going to press the issue, but I got \nanother wave of that dreadful, rotten smell from the house, and realised I had \nto leave before I was sick. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG093 – Contaminant \n8 \n \nThe next time I went back the place was empty, the smell was gone, and I \nnever saw my father-in-law again. \nStatement ends. \nARCHIVIST \n(Sigh) Elias gave me this before I left. Said it might help me “clarify my next \nmove”. I should really have waited, got some rest before I recorded it, or until \nI’d had a chance to move out of Georgie’s. I’ve already stayed here too long. \nIt’s not fair, putting her in danger like this. Or the Admiral. \nGod, if Daisy had come while I was here… \nI wasn’t sure what Elias meant by “my next move” until the end of this \nstatement. Horrible as whatever it was that overtook Greg Russell must have \nbeen, it seems less than entirely relevant to the current situation. But Breekon \nand Hope? Speaking Russian and helping transport a victim of… whatever dark \npower rules over disease and rot. And insects, maybe? I was just about \nconvinced that they served the Stranger, and their speaking Russian might well \nsupport that if it ties them to the Circus, but… this is not the first time they’ve \nbeen delivering things that seem to be tied to other beings. Are they a neutral \nparty, carting round whatever horror needs delivering, just a piece of \notherworldly infrastructure? Or are they fully part of the Stranger, just serving \nas allies of convenience for other things that need to be moved? \nMost importantly, though, it mentions a depot in Newcastle. Sasha checked on \nthe Nottingham depot when they first came up… huh, almost two years ago \nnow. A different time. But that had long been gentrified into luxury flats. Sasha \nnever mentioned there might have been other depots, and I never asked. I", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 3, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 4383}}
