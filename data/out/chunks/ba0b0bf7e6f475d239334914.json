These forces arrayed against you. \nWhat are they? \nLEITNER \n(Sighs) I’d hoped you would at least know that much by now. But I suppose \nyou are simply the observer, and making these connections is not your role. \nGertrude could be much the same at times. \nARCHIVIST \nJust tell me! \nLEITNER \nThere are… entities in this world. Beings of vast, dark power. Perhaps it would \nbe more accurate to say they are ‘next to the world’, rather than in it. Their \ntrue existence could not function in the universe we live in, at least not as it is \nnow. They have nothing in their pure state that could be present in the \nphysical world so they sit in… \nARCHIVIST \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG080 – The Librarian \nDifferent dimensions. \nLEITNER \nNo, I don’t think so. If there are such things, then these beings are linked \ninexorably to ours. They are not within our world, but they can… affect it in \ncertain ways: reaching out with their will to change things. I don’t know where \nthey come from or how they came to exist, but they are, from what I can \ndetermine, effectively eternal. \nARCHIVIST \nAre you… are you trying to tell me all of this is at the behest of… evil gods? \nLEITNER \nOh, there are certainly those who see them as gods. A few even go so far as to \ntry and worship them, but I don’t find it helpful to think of them like that. \nPerhaps you could liken them to one of the old pantheons, each with its own \nrituals, agendas and spheres of influence, but I find simplifying them in such a \nway makes them harder to truly understand. \nThe “gods” were conceived of by humankind as a reflection of themselves, \ntheir motives and actions divinely powerful, but in essence purely human. \nThese… “things”… I find them hard enough to understand without trying to \nforce human frameworks onto them. \nARCHIVIST \nSo the creatures are, what, priests? These books, their holy texts? \nLEITNER \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG080 – The Librarian \nI told you it was an unhelpful analogy. Let’s try another one. Um… Imagine, you \nare an ant, and you have never before seen a human. Then one day, into your \ncolony, a huge fingernail is thrust, scraping and digging. You flee to another \nentrance, only to be confronted by a staring eye gazing at you. You climb to the \ntop, trying to find escape and, above you, can see the vast dark shadow of a \nboot falling upon you. Would that ant be able to construct these things into \nthe form of a single human being? Or would it believe itself to be under attack \nby three different, equally terrible, but very distinct assailants? \nARCHIVIST \nSo the books, the monsters, they’re part of these beings? Just extensions of \nthem? Fingers being pushed into our world? \nLEITNER \nThe books are, I think, their essences in a purer form. The other things that \nstalk us, from what I know of them, they have varying wills of their own. All in \nservice of the thing they’re a part of, but not directly controlled by the mind \nbeneath them. At least, inasmuch as these entities have something we could \nrecognise as a mind. \nARCHIVIST \nLike a… a, a muscle, spasming on reflex? \nLEITNER \nYes, that’s actually rather good. \nARCHIVIST \nIt would explain Michael’s identity issues. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG080 – The Librarian \nLEITNER \nMichael? Oh… that, that’s what the Distortion calls itself these days, isn’t it? \nThat one is part of a power that my assistant Domingo used to call \n“Esmentiaras”, which I believe translates as ‘it is lies’ or ‘it is lying’. At the time, \nof course, we just used it as a way to classify books. I call it the Spiral. It deals \nin fooling the senses, in making you see and hear things that are not there, in \ndrawing you into mazes and making you doubt your own sanity. \nARCHIVIST \nFractals. \nLEITNER \nYes. It seems to have a particular fondness for them. \nARCHIVIST \nWhat about bones? Does one of them manifest with, with bones? \nLEITNER \n(Sigh) You’re thinking too literally. Examining the physical categorisation, but \nignoring the meaning of the thing. What are the bones? In the Distortion, your \n“Michael”, the structure of a skeleton, an established reality in your mind, is \ntwisted and warped into an impossible form. But in other cases? Are they a \nsymbol of slaughter and butchery? Are they the familiar made wrong? Or are \nthey simply part of the messy, physicality of flesh? \nARCHIVIST \nI’m sorry, this is a lot to take in.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 5, "chunk_count": 9, "chars": 4432}}
