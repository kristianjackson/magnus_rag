The Magnus Archives. Episode one hundred and ninety-\nseven: \"Connected.\" \n[Theme finishes] \n[Tape clicks on] \n[A dark electric void sound, swirling winds, and distorted, crackling \nthunder; an impossible web stretched across a gaping chasm] \n[Speeding by every so often is a chitinous rewinding tape sound] \n[Careful, sticky, footsteps] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 197 – Connected \n2 \nARCHIVIST \nWatch your step. Long way down. \nBASIRA \n(Sighs) It’s fine, the stickiness helps. \n(The Archivist grunts) \nCome on. \nARCHIVIST \nRight behind you. \nBASIRA \n(Light sarcasm) Feeling better now are we? Without those horrible sunny skies \nand fresh winds? \nARCHIVIST \n(Light sarcasm) Yes, the colossal web stretching down into an endless pit is a \nsignificant improvement. \nBASIRA \n(Dark chuckle) Don’t pretend like you’re joking. \nARCHIVIST \nAt least I can think straight now. So we have a chance to— Don’t touch that \none! \n[A large, distorted twang that thrums and echoes with high-pitched \nstatic, the sounds reverberating and moving outwards] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 197 – Connected \n3 \n[They stop walking] \nBASIRA \nSorry. \n(Beat) \n[The sounds of the web-twang settle] \nARCHIVIST \nIt’s okay. She already knew I was here, I just… I hoped we might be able to \nsneak you in. \nBASIRA \nI’m guessing she’s waiting at the centre. \n[Hissing static starts] \nARCHIVIST \nNaturally. They both are. Martin is… he’s okay. He’s… scared, but also... \nfrustrated. \nBASIRA \nYou can’t see Annabelle’s plan? \nARCHIVIST \nI know she has something to tell me… and i-it’s about the hole below us… her \nthoughts are all down there and… and the threads are so closely woven, I-I \nfollow them out and in and down and through the strands of web and twisting \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 197 – Connected \n4 \ntape and down and down and down into the chasm into the emptiness, that \nstretches— \nBASIRA \n(Crosstalk) Woah! Woah! Careful! Careful! \nARCHIVIST \n(Crosstalk) —out belo— Woah! \nBASIRA \n[The Archivist loses his balance and Basira grabs him] \n[Hissing static ends] \nARCHIVIST \nThanks. \nThere’s a— Sorry, there’s a s-sort of, pull to it. \n(Basira lets go of a held breath) \nEvery time I get a glimpse it-it, it draws me in... \nBASIRA \nWhat’s down there? \nARCHIVIST \nI don’t know. \nBASIRA \nThat makes a change. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 197 – Connected \n5 \nARCHIVIST \nIt’s… somewhere else. That’s all I’ve got. \n(The archivist exhales heavily) \n[Sticky footsteps resume] \nBASIRA \nSo. The tapes. They’re from the Web, then? \nARCHIVIST \nLooks like it. \nBASIRA \nWere they always? Right from the start? \nARCHIVIST \nAs far as I can tell, it’s hard to s— If I look too closely at them, my own voice, \nthings get… recursive, hard to follow. \nBASIRA \nI always assumed they were with The Eye. The whole ‘watching, listening, \nwaiting’ thing y’know? \nARCHIVIST \nNo, they were always using them to spin their own web. Out of my words. \nBASIRA \nMine too. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 197 – Connected \n6 \nARCHIVIST \nTrue. \nBASIRA \nBut what for? And why here? \n[Hissing static starts] \nARCHIVIST \nI, uh— \n[Basira grabs the Archivist again as he loses balance; they stop \nwalking for now] \nBASIRA \nForget I asked. \n[Hissing static ends] \nARCHIVIST \nOh! Ooh. Hmm. \n[A group of chitinous rewinding tape sounds pass and a distant \nreverberation] \nBASIRA \nCan’t keep catching you every two minutes. \nARCHIVIST \nHeh. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 197 – Connected \n7 \nBASIRA \nAt some point I’ll give in to the temptation. \nARCHIVIST \n(Sarcastic) Hah hah. \nBASIRA \nDifferent question then. How do we play this one? \nARCHIVIST \nYou get Martin to safety, then I deal with Annabelle Cane. \nBASIRA \nRight. \n(Beat) \nI think we should hear her out first. \nARCHIVIST \nExcuse me? \nBASIRA \nBefore you “deal with her”, we should try to get some answers. All of this... \ntaking Martin... she wants to talk. \nARCHIVIST \nShe’s had plenty of chances. She didn’t need to kidnap him.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 0, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 4428}}
