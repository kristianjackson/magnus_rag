What you’re afraid of. For most people, a \ncorpse is at the least unnerving and, for some, outright terrifying. Or maybe it’s \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG036 – Taken Ill \n2 \n \ndisgust. They are two very different feelings, aren’t they? Though they often \nbleed into each other, if you’ll pardon the pun. I work as a funeral director, so \nas you can imagine, how I feel about death and the body is a bit more… \ncomplicated and more immediately relevant than it is for most people. Dealing \nwith cadavers day in, day out forces you to confront all manner of things about \nyourself. \nSimply put, I have found that I do not believe in any sort of afterlife. I have \nseen people cold and lifeless upon the mortician’s table who I knew, who I \nremembered as vibrant and lively. There was no soul that had departed, no \nspecial spark that passed on to something else. Simply a body that no longer \nmoved or spoke or thought. It feels odd to consider the fact that you will no \nlonger exist some day, but you didn’t exist for billions of years before your \nbirth, so, it doesn’t seem unreasonable to conclude that you will not exist \nafterwards in much the same way. I try to see life as a pleasant holiday from \nnon-existence. It provides some comfort when the truth of my own mortality \nstares me in the face every day. \nThere is one thing about dead bodies that does bother me, though. One thing \nthat… eats at me, as it were, and does give me that sick tightness of fear deep \nin my gut. It is rot. I don’t know why it gets to me so; perhaps it’s precisely \nbecause I don’t think there is anything beyond the body, and even dead and \nunaware, seeing a person’s form begin to putrefy and fester – becoming just a \nhome for the crawling, feasting things – is too much for me. Perhaps it’s just an \nunaccountable phobia. Regardless of the reason, the fact is that to see the \ncorpses decaying, to see their flesh corrupted, it is… the one part of this job \nthat I find uncomfortable. So much so that I would describe reconstruction and \npreservation as my favourite part of the process. Making sure the cadaver", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 0, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 3075}}
