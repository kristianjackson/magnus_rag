Maybe he was dead already when his head hit the \ntable. \nIt doesn’t matter. It makes no difference to what happened. \nAnd when it was over, we just stood there, satisfied, basking in what we’d \ndone. Like the warm glow of an approving parent, tinged with a bloody \nsweetness. Or the feeling after a heavy but delicious meal, where you want \nnothing more than to sit and enjoy how full you feel. When Andrew suggested \nhe get rid of the body, no-one thought to object. He and Jamie dragged it out, I \nassume to his car, and that was that. I guess they must have gotten rid of it. \nThe police certainly haven’t come round asking about a corpse. Not that I’d \nknow if they had, I guess. \n\nThe others drifted out at their own pace. They didn’t need to say goodbye. \nThey… didn’t need to say anything. We understood each other perfectly. I \nwandered dreamily into my bedroom, and fell onto my bed. \nI was woken up by a pounding on my door. It was Matis, my flatmate, clearly \nangry and not a little alarmed at the mess in the living room. His face went pale \nwhen he saw I was streaked with gore, and he just kept asking, “Is it blood? Is \nit blood?” I didn’t really know what to say to this, so… I just nodded, and he \ntook a few steps backwards, then he turned and walked away unsteadily. I \nthought about following him, trying to explain what had happened at Murder \nClub, but there didn't seem much point. Poor Matis would never understand. \nAt best he could only watch from the sidelines, getting a… a sad vicarious thrill \nfrom crimes he was too cowardly to even consider. But I was better than that. I \nam better than that. I’m beyond. \nI went back into my room to change into clean clothes. There was no need to \nannounce my intentions to the world, and… the others would certainly be \nwaiting. I took my small knife and tucked it away. I thought about testing it on \nMatis, but there was no way he would have been able to understand what was \nhappening. \nI first paid a visit to Andrew’s house up near Hampstead, where I was told by \nhis upset mother that he wasn’t home. She said he had left abruptly, and had \nshoved her aside when she asked where he was going. As she said this I spun \naround, suddenly afraid I had left myself open, but the street was empty. I \ndidn’t even notice Andrew’s mother slamming the door. I retreated to the \nshade of a tree to think about my next move. For some reason, the memory of \nthe whiskey shop that Andrew had talked about the day before pushed into my \nhead, so I smiled, and took off at a sprint. I’m sure it would have been quicker \n\nto take the Underground or a bus, but I craved that run through the cold \nNovember air, my blood pumping and my teeth sharp. \nI arrived at the small Camden whiskey shop too late. Andrew wasn’t there, but \napparently Debbie and Jamie had had the same idea as me, and they’d met \noutside the shop. If I were a betting woman I’d have put money on Debbie, and \nI’d have been right. She was the sort of big with real strength behind it, and \nshe had used it to put her bread knife all the way through Jamie’s throat. She \nlooked up from the body and saw me. And as soon as our eyes met, I knew the \nchase was on, and this time I was the prey. \nI fled, ducking through alleyways and market stalls as she ran after me. She had \nthe edge in strength, but I was quick, and found it easier to slip through the \nmorning crowds. I had a close call near Camden Lock, but I managed to lose \nher, disappearing up towards Holloway. \nAnd the last five days have been more of that. I caught Evelyn alone two days \nago on a bridge near Leytonstone. She almost threw me into the traffic below, \nbut… instead I stabbed her four times in the chest, and my little vegetable \nblade found her heart. Andrew managed to lure Debbie into an ambush just \noutside my flat, of all places, even though I haven’t been back since the last \nMurder Club. Which, I rather think will have been the last Murder Club. \nAnd I was thinking, yesterday, how strange all this was. And it occurred to me \nthat, while it might seem ridiculous, maybe there was something supernatural \nabout all this. Maybe the chase isn’t as normal as it feels. Before we killed that \nman, I don’t think any of this would have felt right. So I thought I’d come and \ntalk to you, before it all comes to an end. So, sorry if Andrew or Ananya attack \nanyone here because they saw me come in. I don’t think they will, they’re", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 3, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 4454}}
