That isn’t a joke. I had to close up my shop a \nfew years ago, you see. Actual antiques don’t sell to the mass market anymore. \nOh, young people will snap up vintage clothes or have any number of cheap \nfaux-antique replicas strewn about their living rooms, but as soon as they get a \nlook at the price tag for the real thing? They’re out of there like a shot. \nSo I went the same way as a lot of my peers. Lose the premises, start selling \nonly high-margin goods direct to specific clients who can afford them, or shift a \nfew guaranteed sellers on the auction. It’s the only real way to stay afloat in \nthe business nowadays, but the competition is intense, and getting the calibre \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG038 – Lost and Found \n3 \n \nof artefact you need has become a more cutthroat affair. I’m not the only one \nin the business to recently soften their attitude towards buying from people \nlike Mikaele Salesa. \nIt was my first meeting with him, back in March, and I was nervous, so I told \nmy joke. Just offhand, almost a reflex. I didn’t expect any reaction, really, I… I \ncertainly didn’t expect him to laugh. But he did, this sudden, deep, throaty \nlaugh that seemed to come out of nowhere. He didn’t say anything afterwards, \njust continued discussing business. But it stayed with me. There was nothing \nparticularly strange about the laugh, not really. Why do I remember it so \nclearly? \nSalesa was taking me through his ‘showroom’. There was a fancy-looking sign \nabove the door, but it didn’t do much to hide the fact that it was basically a \nwarehouse. More of the antiques were still in their packing crates, and I \ncouldn’t help making a note of how quick and easy it would be for him to pack \neverything down and disappear if he needed to. Still, I’d made a few good \npurchases already and was cautiously optimistic. I’d bought a pair of cavalry \nsabres from the Revolutionary War, absolutely excellent condition, and a \nBritish artilleryman’s tunic from World War I, a few other bits and pieces as \nwell. I recall I felt a moment of relief that I didn’t deal in books, as I caught \nsight of several crates packed to the brim with heavy-looking volumes. I was \nlooking for something big, though. Something that would make an actual dent \nin the mountain of debt I’d been piling up. \nI found it in that old Chinese pot. From the Jiajing period, so Salesa said, and \nthe construction seemed to back him up. The glaze and the workmanship fitted \nwith mid-to-late Ming dynasty, but there was something… off about the actual \ndesign. Instead of the pictures or scenes common to the ceramics of the \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG038 – Lost and Found \n4 \n \nperiod, the blue glaze was painted on in crisp, thin geometric lines. They \nrepeated perfectly and seemed to get smaller and more intricate the closer I \nlooked, but the shapes they formed never lost any of the precision, seeming to \ncontinue on however closely I looked. The effect was disorientating, and made \nthe vase seem smaller than it actually was. It made my head hurt a bit when I \nlooked at it for too long. It was amazing. \nWhen he saw me staring, Salesa clapped me on the back and named a price \nthat almost made me choke. We haggled a bit, and eventually reached a price I \nconsidered only a little bit unreasonable. I hurried my purchases home, feeling \nslightly soiled by my visit to the warehouse, and very much hoping it would be \na good few months, if not years, before I was in such dire straits that I needed \nto go again. I got home, had a shower and some food and immediately started \nto look into finding a buyer for my latest acquisitions. I remember I was \nplanning to make a few calls, but my headache got so bad that I had to have an \nearly night. \nThe problems started soon after. It was little things at first. Like my shoes. I’m \nnot a particularly fashion-conscious man at the best of times, so I have three \npairs of shoes. Comfortable loafers for everyday use, a pair of walking boots \nfor hiking, and some well-shined, polished, leather brogues for fancier events. \nWell, I had a rather upmarket auction that I needed to attend, so I went to put \non my nice shoes, but they were nowhere to be found. Not the shoes, not the \nbox I kept them in. Instead there was bag containing two shirts that I know for \na fact I threw away the year before. When I asked my husband, David, about it, \nhe told me point blank that I had never had any such shoes.
