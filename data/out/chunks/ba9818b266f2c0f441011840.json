On stage, the musicians calmly packed away their instruments. \nThey did not have a spot of blood on them. The one in the brown suit, who I \nassumed to be Alfred Grifter, looked up. He gazed straight into my eyes and \nsaid, “Encore?” I grabbed my phone and ran. \nI didn't phone the police. I was too scared of what might happen. I watched the \nnews obsessively, waiting to see anything on the massacre, but there was \nnothing. It's been almost a week now, and I've heard nothing. I haven’t been \nable to access the footage from that night. My phone says it's incorrectly \nformatted somehow, but I'll keep trying. I did go back to the jazz club, but I can \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG042 – Grifter’s Bone \n10 \n \nfind no sign of violence, no sign of Grifter's Bone, and no sign of the eleven \npeople who died that night. \nStatement ends. \nJONATHAN SIMS \nViolence took place on its premises during the dates in question, and there are \nno police reports that seem to match up with Ms. Ling's description. \nWell, I suppose that's not quite true. According to police reports, in the month \nof October 2013, there were a total of eleven deaths by violence in the Greater \nLondon area. It's impossible to match the details of all of them based on the \ninformation in Ms. Ling's statement, but one of the victims, Mr. Albert Sands, \n67 years old, and beaten to death in his own home. Although it happened two \nweeks before the events of this statement, according to the police he was \nwearing a silk dressing gown when he was brutally murdered. \nWe are unfortunately unable to follow up with Ms. Ling; it seems roughly two \nweeks after giving this statement she assaulted Agatha Norrell, her elderly \nneighbour, with a claw hammer. Ms. Norrell was left in a coma from which she \ndid not recover, while Ms. Ling turned the hammer upon herself. By the time \nthe police arrived she had done so much damage to her head that… there was \nno hope of saving her. I have an uncomfortable feeling she might have finally \ngotten that video to work. \nEnd recording. \n[CLICK] \n[CLICK] \nSupplement. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG042 – Grifter’s Bone \n11 \n \nI've been watching Martin. He's been very attentive to my needs and recovery \nsince I returned to work, almost to the exclusion of his own tasks. Previously I \nmight have ascribed such ministrations to his own lax work ethic, but in the \nstress of Prentiss' attack, I am sure I glanced moments of competence, or even \ncunning, that are beyond what his previous work would indicate. Is he playing \nthe fool? Purposefully failing in his tasks to delay or hinder my investigations? \nIt's possible. He has also shown remarkable interest in my own theories as to \nwho killed Gertrude. I have thus far diverted him by saying I believe it to be \nwhatever is lurking in the tunnels below, but he seems… unsatisfied by that \nresponse. \nI’m glad he’s moved out of the Archives, as it gives me a chance to work here \nwithout his constant presence. Also because he managed to leave some of his \npossessions behind, for the most part it's just a few books of relatively awful \npoetry. There are a few pieces I feel could almost have been affecting if his \nstyle wasn't so obviously enamoured with Keats, but there is an unfinished \nletter addressed to his mother in Devon, in which he mentions that he is \nworried about “the others finding out I’ve been lying”. \nIt may be nothing, some inconsequential deception or other – after all, it is \nostensibly written to his mother – but if it was actually to be sent to someone \nelse… I will keep my eye on Martin. \nEnd supplement. \n[CLICK] \n[The Magnus Archives Theme - Outro]", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 5, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 3684}}
