Too much like hard work, I always used to say, \nand I’m not a young man anymore. So generally, if the finds aren’t near \nenough the surface for me to just pick them up, I’ll leave them be. Sometimes, \nthough, you just can’t help yourself. You need to know what’s under there, so \nyou get down on your knees and dig, dig, dig. \nLast Saturday was like that. I hadn’t thought it would be, really. My knees had \nbeen acting up all week because of the damp, and I was mainly going out for \nthe walk, rather than looking for any particular finds. To be honest, I was in \ntwo minds about taking the metal detector at all; it’s not exactly a lightweight \npiece of equipment. Back when I lived in London I always used to do \nmudlarking down the Thames. Wandering through the low tide with nothing \nbut a bag, my eyes and a pair of thick gloves. I miss those days, without the \nweight of the detector. Without the need to dig. \nI don’t even know why I took it. In the end, that stretch of beach is hardly \nvirgin territory for hobbyists like me, and it’s usually been picked perfectly \nclean. So you can imagine my surprise when I started to pick something up just \nbefore Smeatons Pier. \nIt was almost dark by this point, and the cool salt air of St Ives harbour blew a \nfine spray of sand against my cheeks. It stung slightly, but not in an unpleasant \nway. Bracing, I think the word is. It was peaceful, quiet, and I was lost in my \nown thoughts, staring out over the darkening ocean, when the metal detector \ninterrupted, breaking my trance. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG088 – Dig \n8 \n \nI pulled out my little torch and shone it at the spot, looking for the telltale glint. \nBut there was nothing but sand. Whatever it was must have been buried. I was \ndebating with myself whether to leave it be when the detector barked again, \nmore insistently. I hadn’t found anything else that day, so I sighed, pulled out \nmy small, metal spade out of my bag, and started to dig. \nIt was only a minute or two before I saw it, a hint of gold-plated metal amid \nthe coarser gold of the sand. A watch. The face was cracked down the middle, \nand the hands were frozen at four nineteen, but other than that it seemed to \nbe in rather good condition. Not a bad little find, I remember thinking, as I \nstarted to clean the sand from around it. And uncovered the wrist it was still \nattached to. \nI think I screamed. I must have cried out in some way, but nobody heard me, as \nthere was no-one to hear but me. I cleared away a bit more sand, just to be \nsure of what I was seeing, and quickly revealed a stiff, unmoving hand. The \nflesh was icy cold and discoloured, so I was certain its owner must be dead, but \nit didn’t appear to have begun decomposing. I lowered myself slowly to the \nground, trying to collect my thoughts, considering the thing I had just \ndiscovered with my clumsy, reckless digging. \nI wanted to call the police immediately, but I don’t have a mobile phone, and it \nwas a little bit of a walk to the nearest phonebox. My legs wouldn’t stop \nshaking when I tried to stand up, so I sat there for a while, my torch shining on \nthat lifeless hand, trying to compose myself enough to go get help. It was an \nodd thing, that hand. The fingers were bent and bloody, and the nails had been \nchipped and broken. From the looks of it, the damage had happened before its \nowner had passed away.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 1, "chunk_count": 5, "chars": 4194}}
