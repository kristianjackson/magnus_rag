There was a miserable rain; the \nsort that doesn’t even fall, it just seems to hang in the air, speckling your face \nwith a fine, soaking mist. There wasn’t a single patch of sky that disrupted the \nuniform gloom as I walked past the old takeaway. I stopped for a second, \nstaring at the broken old building as I so often did, when I heard a sound from \ninside. It wasn’t a loud sound, like something small and light falling to the floor. \nI went closer, listening, but the sound didn’t come again. Leaning in, I tried to \nsee through to the inside of the building, but the overcast day didn’t give \nenough light to see by. I stood up, trying to convince myself that I had \n\nimagined it, when a cold breeze blew down, cutting through my coat, and I \nheard laughter. It was so quiet. I could have imagined it. Or maybe it came \nfrom one of the houses nearby, but I looked around and the windows were as \ndark and empty as the sky. \nI turned back towards the shop, and noticed for the first time the missing bolts \nalong the edge of the panel that covered the side window. It was ever so \nslightly ajar. The sound of movement came again, soft and furtive from inside. \nSomeone was in there. I knew that much at least. So I left and called the police. \nI walked to the pub across the road, bought a pint of pale ale and sat outside \non the wooden benches. \nThe drizzling rain diluted my beer slightly, but I didn’t mind. I waited. Twenty \nminutes later a police car pulled up, and I sipped my drink as I watched them \nopen up the door and head into the old takeaway. \nThrough the now-opened entrance I could still see the faded remnants of \ncrime scene tape flapping gently in the wind. There was the sound of shouting, \nand I saw them pulling out a teenage white boy holding a can of red spray \npaint. Kid couldn’t have been more than fourteen with a ratty old hoodie and \nbrand new sneakers the same colour as his paint can. The cops must have \ntalked to the kid for a good ten minutes before they finally took the paint and \nlet him go with a warning, like I knew they would the second I saw him. \nFigures. The cops locked the old takeaway back up and went back to get in \ntheir car. The rain was coming down heavily now, and the one holding the \nspray can lost his grip on it. It wasn’t a long drop from his hand to the \npavement, but it must have hit a sharp stone or something, because when it \nclattered onto the ground part of it split open. The red seeped out of it, mixing \n\nwith the flowing rainwater in a river of colour that made me very uneasy. The \ncops didn’t seem to care; they just got back in their car and drove away. \nI watched the place until I finished my drink. I wanted to see if they’d realise \nthey’d still left the window panel partially open, where the kid had probably \ngot in. If they did, they didn’t come back to fix it. I was soaked to the bone by \nthat point and decided to head home and get dry. My sleep that night wasn’t \ngreat. I kept dreaming of a paint can impaled on a rotary kebab skewer. The \nliquid dripping from it bubbled and boiled in the heat, but it wasn’t paint. \nI woke up the next day bleary-eyed and exhausted, but my mind was still on \nthat open window. I just couldn’t shake it, and I knew I wouldn’t be able to \nrelax until I’d got to see the inside of that place. So I called a friend of mine, \nLeroy Yates, and told him what was going on. His hobby was somewhere in \nbetween urban exploration and housebreaking, so I wanted to talk it through \nwith him. He was over in Homerton, and offered to come help me out. I told \nhim I reckoned I could handle it, but that if I didn’t check in with him in an hour \nor so, he should come down, in case I had trouble of any kind. I grabbed a \nquick bite of cold sausage for breakfast, got my big torch and a small prybar, \nthen headed out into the morning. \nThe rain had stopped but the sun still hadn’t come out and the wet shine \nseemed to weigh heavily on everything. There was nobody on the street. Most \nwere probably at work already. The old takeaway sat there, the letters of \n‘FOOD’ now grey and lifeless. For a second I thought I saw the red neon ‘GRILL’ \nsign flicker, but I’m pretty sure that was just my imagination, as I know the \ntubes were busted. I slipped around the side and found the metal panel \ncovering the window was still ajar. I’m a bit bigger than a", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 2, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 4396}}
