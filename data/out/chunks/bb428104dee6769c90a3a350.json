When I looked \nback at Mike, he was staring at the Leitner book with a wild expression I had \nnever seen on his face before. He pointed at Ex Altiora and asked me how \nmuch it was. I started to tell him it wasn’t for sale, but he had this look in his \neyes, this furious desperation. \nIt scared me, to be honest, and I had a sudden sense that this man was willing \nto kill me for that book. All this, combined with the discomfort I felt with the \nthing anyway, was just a bit too much for me. I named a figure that I thought \nwas maybe double what it was actually worth and Mike wrote me out a \ncheque so fast that I thought his pen would go clean through the paper. For \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG046 – Literary Heights \n8 \n \nthis I insisted on ringing him up a receipt and without another word he was out \ninto the rainy February afternoon. And that would have been it. \nGiven what happened next, I don’t think I would ever have seen Michael Crew \nagain if it wasn’t for the simple fact that his cheque bounced. I didn’t quite \nbelieve it at first. He’d always been so willing to drop huge amounts of money \non books that the idea of him not being able to afford something had never \nquite registered. But there was no mistake. After no small amount of \nconsideration, I decided that the only decent thing to do was to actually go to \nhim and discuss the matter. Maybe I could get the book back. Maybe I could \nmake alternate arrangements. Either way, I felt like I owed it to Mike. \nI had his address on file from a delivery he had requested a couple of months \nback, so it was a simple matter to close up the shop early and make the short \nwalk across Chichester to his flat, rather lavish by student standards, but easy \nenough to find. The sky was a bruised grey as I walked across town and I was \nglad I’d thought to bring my umbrella as it was promising to be a storm. \nI recognised the smell from Mike’s previous visits, though even then I didn’t \nrealise what it meant. I reached his door and knocked. I was careful to be firm, \nbut not aggressive in my knocking as I had an odd conviction that an overly \nconfrontational knock would have made it much harder to retrieve the book. I \nneedn’t have given it any thought at all. The door opened before I’d even \nfinished knocking and I had the oddest feeling in my stomach, as though I was \nstanding on the edge of a great drop, and I took an instinctive step back. Mike \nstood there, looking terrible. \nFrom inside came the odour of a man who has not left the room or opened a \nwindow for some days. Strewn across the floor were pages and pages of \nscrawled Latin text, which alarmed me until I saw the unharmed and whole", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 4, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 2708}}
