Those long, excruciating \nminutes of probing and poking, of temperature taking and needles drawing \nblood and mucus and tears and black bile and yellow bile all to be tested and \ntasted and twisted. A dozen staff flapping around her like carrion birds, \nstealing a little bit more of her each time for their own clumsy guesses and \npainful assumptions. \nAll the while the dread was building, focusing to a hot, tight little ball that \nsettled just below her stomach and shot it through with agonising reminders of \nher fear. Her face, of course, remained impassive, unable to show her \nmounting dread. \nFinally, one of the creatures would step forward, never one she recognised, \nand announce the diagnosis. \n[A breathy, rattling alien sound] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \n‘Skin,’ it might say, or ‘liver’, or ‘bones’, and once, only once, ‘soul’.

Renee would be strapped down tighter to her chair, and wheeled into \nthe lift that smelled like ammonia and rot. \n[Sounds of a corridor, rattling trolley, and a melody-less whistling] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nIt would descend far, far down into the belly of the hospital, before she was \nwheeled down the longest corridor in the building, barely wide enough to fit \nher trolley. The soon-to-be surgeon walked in front, whistling a tune that never \nresolved itself into a melody. Finally, she would be placed in the centre of the \ntheatre, bright lights rendering the rows upon rows of silently watching \ndoctors nothing but silhouettes. \n[The corridor, whistling and trolley are replaced by sound of straps \nand faint buzzing] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nSometimes there was enough anaesthetic to lock her limbs in place; other \ntimes they simply let her thrash. It dulled the pain, but the pain was never the \nproblem. Regardless, they always strapped the anaesthetic mask tight to her \nface before they began to cut. \n[Click of a metal tray, then visceral sounds of surgery] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nThe procedure varied depending on the diagnosis.
