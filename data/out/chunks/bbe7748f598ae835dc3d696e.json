Then \nRosa made an off-colour joke about life drawing and getting ‘hands on’ and I \nforgot about it, but I still ended up going to the class. \nThere were only a few of us learning to sculpt, probably because the class had \nquite a high materials’ cost and was a bit earlier than the others. There was \nme, Mary, who works at the post office, Bill, who I knew from walking his dog, \nand Ray Quinton, who was actually teaching the class, though I didn’t know \nhim outside of that. And then there was… him. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 126 – Sculptor’s Tool \n3 \n \nThe man who introduced himself as “Gabriel” was short and squat, with \nknobbly, bare arms that seemed to reach down almost to his knees. He had \ndark hair he clearly kept short because he thought that nobody would notice \nhow greasy it was, and his face jutted out like it was trying to escape his skull. \nNow, I’m not one to judge on appearances – I was the one who insisted \nDesmond still come to church after his operation – so please don’t think it was \nhis ugliness that set me against that horrid little man. There was just \nsomething about the way he moved, as if he was always too close, right into \nyour personal space, but then you’d look again and he wasn’t. When he walked \nup to me without warning and introduced himself, I only just managed to stop \nmyself obviously recoiling. It was just a feeling. \nSo, our first lessons were very basic, all about how to properly move and shape \nthe clay, how to use armatures and the different tools, and how they \ninteracted with the material. We weren’t really doing much in terms of actual \nsculpting, just listening and watching Ray do his demonstrations. At least, me, \nBill and Mary were all watching him. Gabriel seemed quite content to ignore \nour teacher entirely, focusing instead on the lump of clay in front of him. His \nrough, sausage-like fingers twisted and warped it with ease. I found it a \ndifficult, heavy material to work with, never quite as wet as I needed it to be \nno matter how much water I added, but looking over at Gabriel, it was like it \nwas alive in his hands, eagerly bending itself into whatever shape he wanted. \nAnd those shapes were... odd. I remember one of our earlier projects was just \nto do a fish, just a rough shape of a fish, nice and simple. Ray had even \npremade some armatures for us. I mean, I still struggled, and Mary and Bill had \na good old go at it, but over in the corner, Gabriel just began grabbing and \nmoulding and twisting into a shape that was… well, it certainly wasn’t a fish.
