I’m not a \nfast writer and what I saw is… It’s all very well to say “write down what you \nsaw”, but what if you don’t have the words? What I saw doesn’t make any \nsense, and it makes my head hurt awfully when I try to remember it well \nenough to describe. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG021 – Freefall \n2 \n \nAm I mad? What happened is mad. It can’t have happened. But it did. It took \nmy Robert, and…3 now I can’t even think of how to put it down in a way that \nexplains it. Maybe somewhere in your library are the words that explain what \nhappened, what I saw, but I haven’t read your books, and knowing wouldn’t \nbring him back. I suppose I’ll just have to try. \nMy son, Robert, was always an adventurous boy. Even when he was a child \nhe’d be running off and getting into scrapes every chance he got. We were \nliving out in the country back then, Althorpe, a little village in Lincolnshire, and \nevery chance he got Robert would be out in the woods with his friends, \nclimbing trees and exploring deep into the forests. He had a few other children \nwho would join him, but he always climbed higher than they did, always \npushed further. I can’t even remember all the times he almost got himself lost \nout there when he was growing up. \nAs he got older his interests changed, but that sense of danger never left him. I \nused to have to drive him half an hour every Wednesday because that was the \nclosest leisure centre with a climbing wall, and he was obsessed with reaching \nthe top. After he went away to university, he’d come home every holiday with \nsome new dangerous sport he’d taken up: wakeboarding, mountain-biking. He \nalmost missed his father’s funeral because he was away on a scuba-diving trip \nto Cyprus, and only just managed to book a last minute flight home. It wasn’t \nhis fault, of course, Stephen’s death came as a shock to us all; what I mean to \nsay is… I wasn’t at all surprised when he told me a few years ago that he’d \ngotten very involved in skydiving. \nt had started as a charity thing. His last year at Yarmouth he decided to do a \nskydive for a charity he’d been volunteering with. I went along to support him \nwhen he did it, and when he touched down I could see it in his eyes, even", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 0, "chunk_count": 5, "chars": 3005}}
