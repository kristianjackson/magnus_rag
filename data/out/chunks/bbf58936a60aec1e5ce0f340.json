Keeping an eye on \nit. Checking for… god knows what. This had been my ritual for the previous \nweek, keeping my vigil into the small hours, but that night... that night I fell \nasleep in front of it. I don’t remember my dream. Running, maybe? I know I \nwoke with a start sometime around 2 in the morning \nAs I tried to rub the sleep from my eyes, I heard a sound from the table in front \nof me. It was the dull thump of a heavy book hitting the tabletop. I looked and, \nsure enough, there was my copy of Catch-22, just lying there in front of that \nstrange ceramic thing. And not just my book, there was a small pile of objects \naround the base. My shoes, a tie, things I don’t even remember losing. One by \none they rose up out of the mouth of the vase and tumbled to the table. It \ndidn’t matter how big they were, they all seemed to fit. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG038 – Lost and Found \n8 \n \nAnd then came the moment when everything had been disgorged. I saw all the \nthings that I had lost, and I thought it must be over. It must be done. What else \ncould possibly come of there? And I saw the pale shapes of long, thin fingertips \nbegin to creep above the lip of the pot. I remember thinking that it couldn’t be \na normal person living in that pot, because the fingernails were too dirty. Isn’t \nthat an odd thing to think at a time like that? \nI ran, of course. Turned around and sprinted out of the door and into the street \nand didn’t return until morning. Maybe I should have called the police, but I \nwas in no state to do much of anything except shiver under a tree for hours. \nDavid was gone. I allowed myself some brief hope that maybe he’d just left \nme, maybe he’d escape with just a divorce. But no. One call to the housing \nassociation confirmed that, as far as they were concerned, I’d always lived \nalone. \nI want to smash that thing. I want to dash its maddening patterns to the \nground and stomp on it until there is nothing left but powder. But it’s also \ndisappeared, of course. I can’t find it anywhere. It’s still taking things, though. \nSorry about your pen. \nJONATHAN SIMS \nStatement ends. \nBefore I dig too deeply into the background of this statement, I feel I should \nmention something that puts much of it in a slightly different light. Tim actually \nmanaged to find a copy of Mr. Ramao’s marriage licence. It exists, is signed, \ndated and official, and half of it is blank. Only Mr. Ramao’s details are on the \ndocument, and if it wasn’t for the context of this statement, it would appear he \nwas married to nobody. But he was married. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG038 – Lost and Found \n9 \n \nThis is not the first time Mikaele Salesa’s name has come to the attention of \nthe Institute. Even discounting the incidental role he played in case #0112905, \nhe appears to have something of a knack for locating objects displaying more... \ndisconcerting phenomena. I believe some of the more bizarre things in the \nArtefact Storage area were purchased from him. It has been something of a… \nUrgh urgh. \n[SOUNDS OF A SCRAPING CHAIR] \nJONATHAN SIMS \nI see you… \n[A THUMP AND THEN SOUND OF COLLAPSING SHELVES] \nJONATHAN SIMS \n(Triumphant Sounds) \n[DOOR OPENS] \nSASHA \nAlright? \nJONATHAN SIMS \nAh… Yeah. A... spider. \nSASHA \nA spider? \nJONATHAN SIMS \nYeah. I tried to kill it.... the shelf collapsed. \nSASHA \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG038 – Lost and Found \n10 \n \nI swear, cheap shelves are... Did you get it? \nJONATHAN SIMS \nAh... I hope so. Thinks so. Nasty, bulbous looking thing. \nSASHA \n(Chuckles)Well, I won’t tell Martin. \nJONATHAN SIMS \nOh, god.
