I was freaked out, quite frankly, and started \nchecking through all the examination rooms, the wards next door and the \nindividual patient rooms. All empty, except for those patients physically too \nsick to move or hooked up to IVs. They lay there sleeping, and part of me \nwanted to wake them, just to hear the sound of another human being, to not \nbe alone, but like I say it was three in the morning and, weird as this all was, I \ncouldn’t justify waking up patients just to put my own mind at ease. I went as \nfar as to make as much noise as possible directly outside their rooms, but they \njust slept on. It was as I returned to the waiting room for the third time in as \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG012 – First Aid \n7 \n \nmany minutes that I heard it. It sounded like the growl of an animal, a rolling, \nangry sound, and I realised that the floor was shaking, ever so slightly. I looked \naround for the source of the noise, I was getting more and more frantic by the \nsecond, and then I saw it. Lined up against the wall of the waiting room were \ntwo vending machines. I rarely paid them any attention, as there were better \noptions in the staffroom and one or both of them were usually out of order. \nBut I now saw that the one on the left, a clear-fronted machine that stocked \nbottled soft drinks was shaking violently. As I got nearer I saw why: in every \nbottle, in every row of the machine, the drinks appeared to be violently boiling. \nCokes and lemonades and fruit juices shook and bubbled, before one by one \nthe bottles exploded, coating the inside of the clear plastic front with liquid \nthat still kept steaming and hissing. It couldn’t have taken more than thirty \nseconds for all of them to pop, and then the waiting room was silent once \nagain. \nAt this point I was just about ready to abandon my shift and leave the hospital. \nWhatever was going on there, I wanted no part of it. I ran towards the door \nleading from the A&E to the chill of the December night, not something I \nwould ever have thought I’d look forward to. As I approached, though, I \nnoticed that the plastic at each end of the metal handles was ever so slightly \nwarped. I tentatively touched the back of my hand to them and withdrew it \nalmost immediately – I didn’t even have to touch it to feel the intense heat \nradiating from the door. I almost wept. If I was getting out of there, it wasn’t \ngoing to be through that door. \nI started to make my way back through the wards, heading towards another \nexit, but as I passed through I could hear the burned man still mumbling to \nhimself, louder now, so that his weird chant was audible even outside of his \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG012 – First Aid \n8 \n \nroom. It was starting to get to me. I went in; I don’t know what I was planning \nto do, I just needed to make him shut up somehow. His eyes were open now, \nbloodshot behind the bandages and staring blankly towards the ceiling. At that \nmoment, I decided that I was going to shut him up, even if I had to physically \nhold his mouth closed. I approached him slowly and reached towards his face. \nThe second before I could touch him, a hand shot out and grabbed me by the \nwrist. I turned to see the other burn victim, whose passport had identified him \nas Gerard Keay, on his feet and shaking his head. His grip on my wrist was far \nstronger than I would ever have expected from someone that injured, and I \ncould feel a heat through his bandaged hand, like his skin was still burning \nsomehow. \nI screamed. Why not? I’d already established no-one was around to hear me. \nHe immediately released my hand and apologised, said he’d only been trying \nto protect me. I asked him from what and he gestured to the burned man, still \nlying motionless in his bed, chanting his nonsense phrases. Sparing a glance at \nhis own wrapped form, he said that touching the man would have been a “bad \nidea”. He seemed to be in tremendous pain as he spoke, but did his best to \nhide it. \nI didn’t say anything then. I wanted to ask what was happening and it seemed \nlike he was waiting for me to do just that, but something stopped me. \nSomething told me that if there was a coherent explanation for everything that \nhad happened since the ambulance arrived, then I would be no better off for \nknowing it. After a few seconds of awkward silence, Gerard spoke. He asked \nme if the paramedics had brought any items in with them.
