I knew you’d be able to see for miles and miles \nfrom the top – something I was looking forward to doing when I had my feet \nfirmly on the mountain, less so from the swinging car. The driver stood in the \ncorner of the tiny metal box, looking at us with a bored expression and making \nsome final checks on the controls, which amounted to two buttons and a \nphone. I sat, slightly unsteadily on the rough steel bench as Mum and the old \nman took positions at two of the windows with the best view. The driver \nnodded to himself, slid the door closed and turned a key in the control panel. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 124 – Left Hanging \n5 \n \nThere was a shuddering through the whole structure of the car as the wheels \nabove us began to turn, and we began to climb towards the peak. \nIn some ways, the first minute is the worst. The climb takes just over eight \nminutes in total, but in those first few seconds you can see all the detail of the \nground as it falls away from you, and you feel every metre of that widening \nspace of open air beneath your feet, held at bay by a floor that seems far too \nthin. By the second minute, I’d calmed down slightly, the angle of the cable \nand our speed of ascent having levelled out, and the third minute was almost \npeaceful. \nI risked a look over to Mum, stood at the window, looking out with a serene \nsmile at the retreating ground. I glanced over to the old man, whose face \nbeamed with excitement and anticipation. Minute four was when we hit the \nfirst of the three support towers, and the sudden change of angle and speed \nsent me gripping the edge of my seat, staring resolutely at the floor and willing \nmyself to ignore the swaying of the car. The fifth minute, I risked another look \nout of the windows, just as we hit the second tower and my stomach lurched. I \nsat back down again quickly, hoping the shaking of my legs wasn’t audible to \nmy mother, still staring out of her chosen window. The sixth minute was the \nlast stretch with just open air below us and would have been the final part \nbefore we hit the last tower and started travelling over the mountain itself, but \nthat’s when the car came to a sudden, juddering halt. \nPanic immediately pumped through me and I clenched my teeth together to \ntry and hold in a cry. I took a moment and let out a shaky breath. It was fine. \nThis sort of thing happened all the time, no doubt. Just a small delay. Someone \nat the top taking too long to board the car coming down the other way, maybe. \nI glanced over at the driver and, sure enough, he had a look of puzzlement and \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 124 – Left Hanging \n6 \n \nirritation on his face, but nothing that could be read as concern or fear. He \npicked up the phone next to the controls and started speaking annoyed \nGerman into it, but from his expression it didn’t seem like he was getting any \nanswer. \nI heard similar sounds of irritation from Mum, and gingerly looking over, I \nnoticed that some low-level clouds had come about us, and the window was \nnow covered with a fine, swirling mist, obscuring the view below. The weather \nhad been forecast as clear skies, but it wasn’t unheard of. I would have hoped \nthat not being able to see the earth far below us would have blunted the terror \nI felt as we hung there, swinging gently, but instead it seemed worse, as all I \ncould now picture was an unending, terrible void stretching out below me. I \nheard a small chuckle, and looked over to see the old man smiling to himself, \nhis walking stick discarded on the floor. \nWhat happened next was so fast I barely had time to process it. The old man \nturned towards the door of the cable car, the door I had seen the driver lock \nand secure when we first boarded, and he walked over to it. He gripped the \nhandle and with a single, easy motion, flung it open. The driver saw what was \nhappening and started to lunge to grab him, but it was too late. The old man \nturned back for just a second, looked me in the eyes and gave me a huge, \ntheatrical wink. Then he fell backwards, out of the car, and was gone to the \nswirling air beyond. \nThe driver shouted something and my mother let out a shriek, but the sounds \ndisappeared into the muted skies surrounding us. The driver was back on the \nphone, desperately trying to get someone on the other end, as the door just \nhung there, open to the nothingness beyond the car.
