This worked fine until I \nsaw my father in the dream, walking down Oxford Street, the pulsing veins \nclimbing up his leg and into his chest. I tried to warn him of course – asked \nleading questions on his health and how he was feeling, whether he’d been \ntired recently. I even went so far as to book him a doctor’s appointment, much \nto his annoyance. It did no good, though – ten days later the heart attack came \nfor him and, despite the rapid response of the paramedics and how much of \nhis medical history I had immediately to hand, there was nothing I could do to \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG011 – Dreamer \n7 \n \nsave him. He died on New Year’s Eve, and as 2014 ended, so did any hope I had \nof my dreams doing good in the world. \nIt took a month and a half for my father’s image to fade from the orange glow \nof the streetlamps in my dream London. And by my estimation he had \nappeared about ten days before his death. I tell you this because I feel you \nhave a right to know the sort of timescales that we’re dealing with here. I \nhaven’t had much of a chance to experiment or see anything more specific, I’m \nafraid. There are so many people who die in London, and I know so few of \nthem. But I recognise you. As I write these words I can see you in the other \nroom, eyes locked on whatever book you’re diverting yourself with; I recognise \nyou from my dreams. They said at the front desk that you review all the \nwritten statements, so I can only hope that you take the time to read through \nthis one fully. \nAllow me to explain in a bit more detail. It was the night before last that the \ndream came again. It started as it always did, with me on top of Canary Wharf, \nbut almost immediately I could feel that something had changed. The dull \norange glow that thrummed up from below seemed muffled somehow and \nthere was an oppressive knowledge within me that something was deeply \nwrong. Looking down, I could see that the veins, whose domination of the \ndreamscape had only ever been partial before, had thickened and now seemed \nto cover almost the whole space of every street. They still pulsed as before but \nrather than pumping their dark, unknown cargo invisibly, there would now \nsometimes be seen a dark red light that travelled along the inside of them. I \nthought I saw this red light illuminate faces and shadows within those tendrils \nbut it moved too quickly for me to be sure of any details beyond the direction. \nThis was not something I had ever seen happen before in these dreams, and I", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 3, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 2830}}
