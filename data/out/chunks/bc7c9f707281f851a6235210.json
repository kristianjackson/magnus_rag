The door at the top wasn't locked, so I \nfind myself in the ground floor hall of the building and I'll admit it was a real \nrelief to get out of that place and into the well-lit main building. I could have \nleft at that point, probably should have, but I decided to try one more time to \nsee if I could talk to the current occupants of Mr. Vittery's old flat. \nDue diligence… and all that. So I, I head up to number four and give a few \nknocks on the door. I didn't expect anyone to be in, but the door's opened by \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG022 – Colony \n5 \n \nan old woman in a headscarf. I tried to ask her some questions, but it became \nclear she didn't really speak much in the way of English. After a few seconds \nshe just shook her head and pointed behind me, closing the door \nunceremoniously. \nTurning around, I see a large, dark-skinned man in a very nice-looking suit \neyeing me with a bit of suspicion. He introduced himself as Yasir Kundi, and \nsaid he owned the building, and became slightly more co-operative after I lied \nto him and told him that one of the upstairs residents had buzzed me in. I told \nhim why I was there, although obviously I didn't mention… breaking in or the \nInstitute or what we do because I find people often don't understand or \nrespect that out in the real world. I just said that following Mr. Vittery's death I \nwas looking into some aspects of his history and did he remember anything \nabout the time he was a tenant? Mr Kundi was about as helpful as you might \nexpect. Told me Carlos Vittery had lived there, seemed weird, always shut \nhimself up, but was never a problem, paid his rent on time. Used to have a cat, \nbut it now lived with the Sanderson couple in number two. He seemed \ngenuinely surprised to hear about the death, but wasn't able to shed any sort \nof light on it. It wasn't a lot, really. Still, about as much as I might have \nexpected, so I headed back to the Institute and updated you on what I’d found. \nAnd, well, as I'm sure you're aware that was the last time I saw you before I \ndisappeared. \nI was heading home when I got to thinking, and I was worried I hadn't really \ndone enough investigation for you, since I got so freaked out by the basement \nand all. And then I remembered that I'd seen quite a lot of spider webs in the \nbrief time I was down there, and maybe I should check it out again. I mean, like \nI said, I'm not really afraid of spiders. So… I went back for another look. It was \ndark when I got to Boothby Road, but I saw that the basement window was still", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 2, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 2727}}
