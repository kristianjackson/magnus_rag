Michael \nwas waiting for me next to the tall iron gates when I arrived. I caught a glimpse \nof its reflection in one of the deep pools of rainwater, and shuddered as I saw \nagain – the warped body and swollen bony hands. \nIt didn’t say anything when I arrived, just nodded at me to follow. I have no \nidea how long he had stood there waiting for me. I expected to go into the \ngraveyard, but instead Micahael started walking down the road towards a \nnearby row of houses. The sign on the road said Azalea Close. Most of the \nbuildings were in good repair, but there was one at the end that looked \nabandoned. It might have been a pub at one point, but now all the windows \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG026 – A Distortion \n11 \n \nwere boarded with metal sheets, and covered with dirt and graffiti. The door, \nhowever, was open and swinging gently. Michael went inside, clearly expecting \nme to follow, so I did. \nInside was dark and dusty. I was annoyed with myself that I hadn’t thought to \nbring a torch, but just enough of the setting sun came through the door for me \nto see by. It clearly had once been a pub, and the bar appeared to be intact, \nthough riddled with woodworm. Sitting on top of it was what looked like a \nbuilder’s kit, with a toolbox and a small fire extinguisher. I was just about to \nask Michael why we were here, when I heard it. A low, wet groan coming from \nthe far end of the room, where the light didn’t reach. It sounded like someone \nin a great deal of pain. \nI walked towards the noise. As I got closer my eyes began to adjust, and I saw \nthe floor was covered in pale, writhing shapes. I had a listen to Martin’s \nstatement after you recorded it, so I knew what to expect. But hearing about \nsomething doesn’t even come close to seeing it. To smelling it. I expected to \nsee what Martin described, a squirming mass that was once Jane Prentiss, but \nthe figure slumped against the wall looked like it was once a man. The worms \nwriggled out through the holes in his skin. The ‘flesh-hive’, Michael had called \nit, and the silver things formed clustered knots where his eyes used to be. I \ncouldn’t help it. I gasped. \nIt wasn’t a loud sound, and given how sick the whole situation made me feel I \nthink I actually was quite composed. It was loud enough, though. The head \nsnapped around to face me, dislodging a small cascade of twisting shapes. The \nmouth opened as he tried to scream but that wasn’t what came out of his \nmouth. The worms also seemed to have taken notice and began to move \ntowards me at an alarming speed. I backed away, but slipped on a piece of \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG026 – A Distortion \n12 \n \nloose wood and fell into the bar. I glanced desperately at Michael, but it just \nwatched me, its face unreadable. \nI started to try and stamp on the worms as they approached, but there was \njust too many of them. Staggering to my feet, I felt my hand come to rest on \nsomething cold and metal – the fire extinguisher. Without thinking, I pulled the \npin out and squeezed the handle. A cloud of gas shot out and, to my surprise, \nthe silver worms began to shudder and recoil, shrivelling and dying. I began to \nwalk forward, catching every last one in the jet of gas. Finally, I found myself \nstanding over the mass of pitted and hollow skin that was once a man. He \nshuddered violently as the gas engulfed him, and then lay still. \nI was breathing heavily, and the CO2 from the fire extinguisher was making me \nfeel light-headed. For some reason I felt like I should check his pockets. They \nwere empty except for a wallet. It was stained with blood and other \nsubstances, but the name on the driver’s licence was still readable: Timothy \nHodge. \nAs I stood there, staring at the wallet, I felt a sharp pain in my right arm. I \nlooked up to see Michael, reaching into my shoulder. Its fingers were long and \ndistorted as they reached through my skin, cutting it like paper. I screamed. \nAfter a few seconds, it withdrew its hand. Held there was a single silver worm, \nwriggling pathetically in its grip. I hadn’t even felt the thing burrowing into my \narm. \nAfter that it’s all a bit of blur. I remember I was going to phone the police, but \nTimothy Hodge’s corpse was gone, and I was worried about trespassing, so I \njust sort of wandered away. Michael, or whatever it was, had gone as well. \nEventually I found my way back to the Institute, where I must have woken up \nMartin and, well, here we are.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 5, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 4476}}
