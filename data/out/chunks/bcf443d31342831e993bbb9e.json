I don’t know what I’m doing here. I’m not a \nsniper— \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 179 – Accomplice \n \n13 \nBASIRA \nGoddamnit. \n[A growl comes from Daisy’s direction; before recommencing \nrendering noises] \nARCHIVIST \nBasira, are you sure you’re up to this? It doesn’t need to be right now. W-We \ncan always back off, regroup, wait for a better situation. One where she isn’t… \nelbow deep in some poor sod’s corpse. \nBASIRA \nDon’t do that. \nARCHIVIST \nSorry. \nMARTIN \nWhat am I missing here? \nBASIRA \nHe knows as well as I do that the only reason we’re even able to get this close \nis because she’s busy with a kill. There isn’t going to be a better opportunity. \nMARTIN \nNow or never then. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 179 – Accomplice \n \n14 \nBASIRA \nYeah. \nI made her a promise. \nARCHIVIST \nYou need to be certain. \nBASIRA \nI am. \n[Basira takes aim again, hesitates again] \nBASIRA (CONT’D) \nWould you stop staring at me like that? \nARCHIVIST \nLike what? \nBASIRA \nLike you’ve looked inside my head, and you don’t like what you see. \nARCHIVIST \nIf that’s an accusation, then you’re wrong. I don’t do that. \n[Feasting sounds stop] \nBASIRA \nRight. Like you’re suddenly given infinite power and no consequences, and \nthat’s when you decide to start respecting people’s privacy. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 179 – Accomplice \n \n15 \nARCHIVIST \nIs that really so hard to believe? \nMARTIN \nUh... \nBASIRA \nYeah, John. It is. \nMARTIN \nGuys, guys… \nBASIRA \nIf you have something you want to say god-boy, just say it. \nMARTIN \nGuys… \nARCHIVIST \nLook. I know it’s hard and you have your reasons, but it is not my fault that you \ncan’t bring yourself— \nMARTIN \n(Exasperated, hushed) Shut up! Both of you! \nBASIRA \nWhat? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 179 – Accomplice \n \n16 \nMARTIN \nShe’s gone. \nARCHIVIST \nWait, what? Oh. Oh no. \nBASIRA \nGet down! \n[Daisy leaps with a growl] \n[Physical struggle ensues between Daisy & the Archivist, growling \nthroughout] \nARCHIVIST \nDaisy, no! \nBASIRA \nOut the way! \nMARTIN \nLet him go! \nBASIRA \nGet out the way! \nARCHIVIST \nTake the shot! \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 179 – Accomplice \n \n17 \nMARTIN \nNo, you’ll hit John! \nARCHIVIST \nTake the shot Basira! \nBASIRA \nUh… \nARCHIVIST \nBasira! Do it! \nMARTIN \nDon’t! \nBASIRA \nI can’t… \n[Teeth and claw contact flesh, bone crunches; the Archivist is caught] \nDaisy! Stop! Please. \n(The Archivist whimpers) \n[Daisy’s speech is low and guttural, expressed with difficulty \nthrough a jaw unfamiliar to human words – some consonants \nelongated, some vowels slurred] \nDAISY \nBasira? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 179 – Accomplice \n \n18 \nBASIRA \nOh god. Daisy... \nARCHIVIST \nDaisy. Please let me go. \n(Increased growling from Daisy and pained Archivist sounds) \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nAh… Or not. Or not. \nMARTIN \nBasira... \nBASIRA \nI know. \nMARTIN \nBut John— \n(Pained Archivist sound) \nBASIRA \nI know! Just give me a second... \n[Daisy moves] \nDAISY \nBasira. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 179 – Accomplice \n \n19 \nBASIRA \nShe knows who I am! She recognises me! \nMARTIN \nB-Basira! \nBASIRA \nDaisy, come back to us. You can come back. Please. \nDAISY \nBasira... C-come. Come on… \n \n[Basira takes a step forward] \nBASIRA \nWhat? \nDAISY \nCome. Got to get them. \nBASIRA \nI... Sure. Just… \n[Basira takes a step forward] \nBASIRA (CONT’D) \n…let him go. \n[Daisy drops the Archivist with a low snarl] \n(The Archivist collapses with a grunt) \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 179 – Accomplice \n \n20 \nMARTIN \nOh John! Oh shit. Shit, shit, shit. Okay, okay, okay, I’ve got you. I’ve got you. \n[Martin rushes over to begin first aid] \nARCHIVIST \nArgh! Ah! Ah! \nMARTIN \nI’m sorry! Sorry! Sorry! You j— You need to keep pressure on that leg while I-I \nsort this…um… \n[Martin drops his backpack] \n[Basira takes a step] \nBASIRA \nDaisy, please. \nJohn, can you... Can you do anything? \nDAISY \nBasira… \nARCHIVIST \nI’m sorry. I told you. She’s too… too deep. I can’t do anything, not without \nkilling her. \nBASIRA \n(Pleadingly) Daisy. It’s me. Come on, please... \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 179 – Accomplice \n \n21 \nDAISY \nPartner. C-Come. \nBASIRA \n(Beat) \n[Hissing static starts] \nOh. I see. \nMARTIN \nWhat? \nBASIRA \nShe... she wants me to join her. In the Hunt. \nMARTIN \nWhat? Could… Is that even possible? \nBASIRA \nYes. \nI can feel it. In the blood. \nARCHIVIST \n(Weakly) Basira… \n[Basira takes three more steps] \nBASIRA \nI can’t leave her like this. She’s always had my back.
