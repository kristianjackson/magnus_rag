You know, in fact, if I were to be blunt, I’d say that it would be \nsuicidally stupid. \nPETER \n(Patiently) Martin, it’s going to be decades, if not centuries, before I get \nanother chance to bring Forsaken into this world. Your last Archivist saw to \nthat. Honestly, if Elias hadn’t killed that woman, I’d have been very tempted. I \nwarned him she was a danger, but he alway— \nMARTIN \nPeter. Peter. \nPETER \nAnyway, the point is that yes, obviously, if I last that long, I’m going to try \nagain. But I’m rather keen for the world not to end in the meantime. \nMARTIN \nHmm... \nPETER \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 134 – Time of Revelation \n \n12 \n \nMartin, this is what we agreed. After The Flesh attacked, you came to me, and \nI’ve held up my end of the bargain, despite your continued hesitations. Your \nfriends have been largely untroubled by the many, many enemies that they \nhave made. \nMARTIN \nWhat about the delivery guy? Breekon? And the coffin? \nPETER \nWas that its name? To be honest with you, I thought it was dead. \nMARTIN \nYou thought wrong. \nPETER \nTrue enough. And as soon as I learned it was here, I moved to intervene, but... \nWell, it turns out I wasn’t really needed, and as far as the coffin goes, there’s \nnot much I can do about a bull-headed Archivist, who seems hell-bent on self-\ndestruction. My powers only extend so far. \nMARTIN \nMmmhmm. \nPETER \nLook, I’m not going to pressure you into doing anything you don’t want to. It \nwon’t even work unless you’re willing to commit. In any case, I have plenty of \npreparations to work on myself before it’s ready. I’ll see what else I can find to \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 134 – Time of Revelation \n \n13 \n \nhelp with your reservations in the meantime. Okay? Just don’t hesitate too \nlong. We are on a deadline after all. \nMARTIN \nFine. \nPETER \nRight, then if you’ll excuse me, I have a family thing to get to. \nMARTIN \nAre we going to talk about John? \nPETER \nDo we need to? \nMARTIN \nI… Uh... \nPETER \nBecause, to be honest, I’m not entirely sure what’s been going on with him \nthese past couple of weeks. \nMARTIN \n(Sceptical) Oh, yeah, sure. \nPETER \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 134 – Time of Revelation \n \n14 \n \nMartin… My patron, hopefully our patron someday, doesn’t give me any sort \nof special insight. I’m not quite the accomplished voyeur that Elias was. I have \nto keep tabs on things the old-fashioned way. \nMARTIN \nWhat, turning invisible and eavesdropping? \nPETER \nIf you like. But I’m only one person and I can’t keep an eye on everything. \nMARTIN \nOr anything, apparently. \nPETER \nAs I said, one of the last shreds of the circus delivered a gateway into Too-\nClose-I-Cannot-Breathe. I went to help, but was too late. Then your detective \nfriend— \nMARTIN \nNo, she’s not a detect— \nPETER \n—went on one of Elias’ wild goose chases. Then John wilfully hurled himself \ninto the coffin. I did not intervene, because thankfully, I did not agree to \nprotect your friends from their own idiocy. Though actually, he gave it more \nconsideration than I thought he would. \nMARTIN \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 134 – Time of Revelation \n \n15 \n \nHe’s not a moron. \nPETER \nIf you say so. Regardless, he’s in there three days, then what do you know, he \nmanages to pull himself out of the coffin like a grubby Jesus and he even brings \na penitent thief along in the form of your pet murderer. Does this seem about \nright to you, so far? \nMARTIN \nYeah. \nPETER \nNow, from my point of view, so far, none of this has been any of my business. \nWe have bigger concerns than this little soap opera you call an archive. What \ndoes puzzle me, though, and I mean that genuinely, is why you were piling \ntape recorders onto the coffin while John was in there? \n… \nIt’s a question, Martin. It’s not an accusation. \nMARTIN \nI don’t know. I just felt like it might help. He’s always recording; I thought it \nmight help him find his way out. \nPETER \nInteresting. Were you compelled? \nMARTIN", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 6, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 4034}}
