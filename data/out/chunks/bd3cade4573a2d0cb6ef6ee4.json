I just know it. \n(Beat) \nMARTIN \nYou’ve been knowing a lot, lately. \nARCHIVIST \nYes. \nMARTIN \nA lot more than you used to. \nARCHIVIST \nYe..Yeah. \nAnd it, and it feels more… deliberate. Like I have more control now. \nMARTIN \nOkay. \nSo… How much can you see? What else do you know? \nARCHIVIST \nUhh... (surprise) Maybe everything. \nMARTIN \nWhat do you mean, ‘everything’? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 164 – The Sick Village \n9 \nARCHIVIST \nI don’t— Ask me a question. O-one I can’t, possibly know already. \nMARTIN \nOkay... What’s my middle name? \n[Hissing static starts] \nARCHIVIST \nHuh. \n(Shocked) Y-you don’t have one! \nMARTIN \n(Impressed) Whoa. \nARCHIVIST \nYou— I actually believed you! \n[Hissing static ends] \nMARTIN \nOh- S-Sorry; sorry, I just, I just wanted to try it out— \nARCHIVIST \n‘That’s ridiculous,’ I thought, ‘That’s not a real name, but he wouldn’t lie to \nme.’ \nMARTIN \nO-okay, okay, okay, okay. Let’s, let’s try something a little bigger, then. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 164 – The Sick Village \n10 \nARCHIVIST \nAlright. \nMARTIN \nIs Basira alive? Is she in… o-one of these places? \n[Hissing static starts] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nShe’s alive. Out there, not trapped in a hellscape, but— moving. Hunting. \nShe’s… she’s looking for Daisy. She’s a few steps behind. \n[Hissing static ends] \nMARTIN \nAnd Daisy? \n[Hissing static starts] \nARCHIVIST \n...Bestial. Brutal. Carving her way through the domains of other Powers, \nfollowing the scent of blood— \n(The Archivist sighs) \nOh, Daisy, I’m sorry. \n[Hissing static ends] \nMARTIN \nWhat’s Basira going to do? \n[Hissing static starts] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 164 – The Sick Village \n11 \nARCHIVIST \nShe— thinks she’s going to kill Daisy. Like she promised. But she’s conflicted. \n[Hissing static ends] \nMARTIN \nAnd will she? \nARCHIVIST \nI-I don’t know; th-the future, th-th-that’s… that’s not something I can see. \nMARTIN \nOkay, good to know. How much further do we still need to go? \n[Hissing static starts] \nARCHIVIST \nA long way. \nThrough many dark and awful places. \nMARTIN \nIs this— A-are you okay? How are you feeling? \nARCHIVIST \nI- Um, I, I’m okay. I-It’s a little, strange? But i-it doesn’t hurt. \n[Hissing static ends] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nKeep going; you have questions, let’s hear them. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 164 – The Sick Village \n12 \nMARTIN \nOh, oh, okay, um. How are the others? \n[Hissing static starts] \nARCHIVIST \nI, uh. \nHuh. I’m-I’m not sure. I-I can’t really see Melanie, or, or, or Georgie. \nMARTIN \nThey’re dead? \nARCHIVIST \nNo, no, I-I don’t think so, if they were dead, I-I think I would know that, I just— \nI don’t know… where they are, w-what they’re doing. \nMARTIN \nHm. \nARCHIVIST \nL-London, maybe? \n[Hissing static ends] \nMARTIN \nWhat about Elias? \n[Hissing static starts] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 164 – The Sick Village \n13 \nARCHIVIST \n(Darker) He’s inside the Panopticon. The tower, far above the world. \nMARTIN \n(Dryly) That one? \nARCHIVIST \nYes. \nMARTIN \n(Hateful) How is he? \nARCHIVIST \nHard to say. The, the way this works, this new sight, the knowledge is, is... \n(sigh) somehow wrapped up in the Panopticon? Ah… an eye can’t see inside \nitself. \nMARTIN \nHmm. \nARCHIVIST \nBut I can feel him in there. \nMARTIN \nHm. That sounds... gross. \nARCHIVIST \nIt is. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 164 – The Sick Village \n14 \n(They both laugh) \nMARTIN \nAre we safe, traveling like this? \nARCHIVIST \nYes. \nYes, sort of, we’re… I don’t know how to phrase it, we’re… something between \na pilgrim and a moth. We can walk through these little worlds of terror, \nwatching them. Separate, and untouched. \nMARTIN \nThat’s not as comforting (slight chuckle) as you might think. \nARCHIVIST \nI like it better than the alternative. \n[Hissing static ends] \nMARTIN \nFair point! (small laugh) Okay, okay, uh, what else, what else, um... Oh! Um, \nuh, who was— uh, uh, phone! Um, w-who was calling me? \n[Hissing static starts] \nARCHIVIST \n...I think it was Annabelle Cane.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 3, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 4268}}
