Episode one hundred and thirty. \nMeat. \n[Tape clicks on] \nGERTRUDE \nDo you mind? \nLUCIA \nWhat? Oh, um, no. \nGERTRUDE \nExcellent. \nLUCIA \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 130 – Meat \n2 \n \nWhy a tape recorder? Why not digital? \nGERTRUDE \nThere’s nothing wrong with tape. A bit old fashioned, but I suppose, so am I. \nLUCIA \nRight. Yes. Th-that’s fine. It’s all fine. \nGERTRUDE \nAre you quite ready? \nLUCIA \nUm, will it help? \nGERTRUDE \nI’m sorry? \nLUCIA \nTelling my story. To you. W-will it help, with the nightmares? \nGERTRUDE \nIf that’s your primary goal, my dear, I would suggest you speak to a qualified \ncounsellor. We can suggest one if you like? That said, I do believe most people \nfind the process of giving a statement to be rather... cathartic. And whatever \nnightmares your experience has left you with, I’m sure they won’t be bothering \nyou much longer. \nLUCIA \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 130 – Meat \n3 \n \nOk, then. So… what do I do? \nGERTRUDE \nLet’s start with your name. \nLUCIA \nOh. (Laughing nervously) Lucia, Lucia Wright. \nGERTRUDE \nAnd what is your statement regarding? \nLUCIA \nJust, um, a hole. A hole filled with... with meat. \nGERTRUDE \nGertrude Robinson recording, December 19th, 2008. \nIn your own time. \nLUCIA (STATEMENT) \nRight, okay, so… Um, I was on holiday, actually. Well, meant to be, at least. No, \nno, I, I was. Whatever happened later it was technically a holiday. Sorry, I’m \nrambling. \nI like to travel when I can. I’m not one of those people who can take months \nand months and go swimming with dolphins or climb Machu Picchu; my job is \nvery high-pressure. Well, it was. The point is, I used to take a lot of city breaks, \nspending a long weekend flying off to anywhere with decent flights and seeing \nthe sights. I’d generally try to take in an art gallery, a few of the best \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 130 – Meat \n4 \n \nrestaurants the guidebooks recommend, and somewhere with a decent view \nof the whole city. And, of course, a couple of churches. \nI’ve always had an odd relationship with churches. I suppose I was raised \nChurch of England, but my parents were never very involved with it, and when \nI told them that I wanted to stop going when I was fourteen, they didn’t make \na fuss. I had a few years as an angry atheist, but when I was about twenty, I \nswung back the other way a bit and became pretty fascinated with religion – \nnot in a belief sense, but I found it all really interesting, especially early \nChristianity and the church. So much politics over what it means to be good, to \nbe holy. So many heresies about the Trinity, about how human Jesus was, \nabout how many nails they used to crucify Him. But more than that, I loved \nchurches. These big, quiet, echoing spaces of peace and beauty designed to \nquiet the soul and prepare it for communion with the divine. Even if I didn’t \nactually believe in the God they were supposed to house, I always found \nthem… meditative, and whenever I went on one of my breaks, I’d always try to \nfind a local church, hopefully not too full of other tourists like me, and spend \nan hour or two in quiet contemplation. \nI’d listen to the shuffling footsteps of the other people and breathe in the \nlingering smell of incense, before lighting a candle to my grandmother. She had \nalways been very religious, although since most of the churches I visited were \npicked for their design, they tended to be Catholic or Orthodox, and I’m not \nsure how happy she’d have been about my lighting a candle for her in them. \nStill, at the end of the day, I did it for me, not for her. She’s gone. There isn’t \nanything but us. \nAnyway, when a deal came up in the middle of October for five days in \nIstanbul, I jumped on it. I’d heard a lot of lovely things about the city itself, but", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 0, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 4050}}
