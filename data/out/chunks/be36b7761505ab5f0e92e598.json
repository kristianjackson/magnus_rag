My apologies. \nMARTIN \nYou used to watch it? \nELIAS \nI’m sorry to hear it’s no longer running. Your techniques were rudimentary, but \nyou showed surprising promise. On occasion. \nMELANIE \nThank you… I think. \nMARTIN \nMelanie was actually just leaving. Erm, I think we were done. \nMELANIE \nUh, yes… yes. \nELIAS \nOne moment, Miss King. Martin has filled you in on recent events, I believe? \nMELANIE \nI mean, a, a bit. \nMARTIN \nNot everything. \nELIAS \nThen you are aware there is currently a vacancy for an archival assistant? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG084 – Possessive \n16 \n \nMELANIE \nYes. And an archivist. \nELIAS \nOh, I don’t think we need to worry about that just yet. But the assistant role… \nMELANIE \nHang on, are you offering me a job? \nMARTIN \nWhat? \nELIAS \nYou have some experience in the field, I believe. \nMELANIE \nWell, yes, but… \nMARTIN \nI mean, that doesn’t actually, er, make her qualified. \nELIAS \nFormal qualifications aren’t everything, Martin. Do you want the job, Melanie? \nMELANIE \nOh… Um, I… Well, it’s, it’s rather sudden, but… er, I mean, sure. Yes. Yes, I do. \nMARTIN \nMelanie, I’m really not sure that you actually want to – \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG084 – Possessive \n17 \n \nELIAS \nProblem, Martin? \nMARTIN \nNo, er, no, no, I-I guess not. \nELIAS \nGood. Well, if you want to come on up to my office and we’ll have a proper \ninterview. Hopefully get all the paperwork signed. \nMELANIE \nLead the way. \n[Elias and Melanie leave] \nMARTIN \nGreat!
