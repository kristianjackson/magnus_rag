(Exhale) But I couldn’t be a \npart of it. Not when I saw what happened to everyone else you involved. \nI had to get out, to escape this place. I had a son to look after; he needed me! \nOr so I thought. \nAnd that’s when you turned nasty, isn’t it? When all your resources, they no \nlonger want to serve your purpose. I suppose you didn’t know there was a way \nout, a way to escape. But if you had, would you have told me? \nMary, at least, played straight with me. She knew all about the Institute. And \nwhen we were married, when she was sure I could handle it, she laid it all out \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 154 – Bloody Mary \nfor me: the rituals, the Powers, all the messy little cogs of the games you play \nwith the universe. \nShe laid out her own plans as well, her dreams of power. In many ways, I \nsuppose they were no better than yours. But at least she didn’t bother to hide \nbehind noble aims. \nMaybe that’s why I chose her, in the end. At least she was honest. Or perhaps I \nactually was afraid. Terrified of the crossroads where I’d found myself, and I \nchose the option I thought might keep Gerry safe. \nAt least if I was home with him, I could perhaps soften the edges of his mother. \nI suppose I never really understood. No matter how clear the situation was, \nhow well it was explained to me, I just couldn’t see the parts of it that I didn’t \nwant to. \nTwo years, I tried to figure out how to quit, how to leave this place. And when I \nfinally did, when I felt the Watcher’s grip slip away, it left me in such a state I \nwas no longer useful to Mary, and... she did what Mary does. (Short laugh) It \nwas fitting, I suppose. Even after everything, she made me taste blood one last \ntime. \nGERTRUDE \nWell, thank you for that. I’ll make sure it’s stored somewhere- safe. \n(Eric inhales shakily.) \nERIC \nRight. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 154 – Bloody Mary \nGERTRUDE \nSomething wrong? \nERIC \nI just- (small sigh) I thought it would be more of a relief. \nGERTRUDE \nMm. I’m sorry it wasn’t as cathartic as you were hoping. But we had an \nagreement. \nERIC \nYeah. I know. \nGERTRUDE \nSo. How did you do it? How did you quit the Archives? \nERIC \nIt was actually really simple. Not easy, but simple. You’ll kick yourself when I \ntell you. \nGERTRUDE \nOkay… \nERIC \nYou were almost there, you know, with your theory that James could watch us \nfrom any eye, even an illustration. What did you do? How did you sever that \nlink? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 154 – Bloody Mary \nGERTRUDE \nMy God! \nERIC \nI left to avoid dragging my family, my son into this life, to try to look after him. \nBut Mary decided that a newly blinded husband was simply too much of a \nburden. \nGERTRUDE \nDid you need to do anything special? Any... ritual, or...? \nERIC \nJust as long as they’re useless. I went the extra mile, destroyed them \ncompletely, but- I’m sure you’ll find something (inhale) neater. A strong acid, \nprecisely applied? That sounds more your style, if you decide to do it, that is. \nGERTRUDE \n(Conflicted sound) Well, I don’t know. \nERIC \nNo. It’s not an easy sacrifice to make, is it? \nGERTRUDE \nI still have work to do. \nERIC \nDon’t you always. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 154 – Bloody Mary \nGERTRUDE \nYeah. Well, (exhale) I think I’ll rather do some research of my own, before the \nrather extreme step of blinding myself. \nERIC \nIt’s the only way. Trust me, I tried them all. \nGERTRUDE \nYes. I remember. \nERIC \nSo, was there anything else? \nGERTRUDE \nNo. No, I don’t think so. \nERIC \nThen if you don’t mind? I think I’d like to go away now. \n(Pause.) \nGERTRUDE \nYes. I think that’s probably for the best. You’re certain burning will work? \nERIC \nIf it doesn’t, I’m sure you’ll figure something out. \nGERTRUDE \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 154 – Bloody Mary \nThen let’s get it over with. \nERIC \nIf you see Mary again, tell her- (beat) No. I guess there’s not really anything \nelse to say. \n[Tape clicks off. Tape clicks on.] \n(The Archivist sighs heavily.) \nARCHIVIST \nFuck. \n[Tape clicks off. Tape clicks off. Typing sounds: the sounds of Martin \nworking.] \nMARTIN \n(Still typing) Oh. Hi. Hello again. \n[He keeps typing.] \nMARTIN (CONT’D) \n(Small laugh) Sorry pal, false alarm this time. \n[He stops typing.] \nMARTIN (CONT’D) \n(Sigh, voice darkens dramatically) Unless… Peter. \n[The clock ticks in the background.]", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 4, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 4408}}
