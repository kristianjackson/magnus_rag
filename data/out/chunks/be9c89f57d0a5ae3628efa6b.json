Once I looked \nup, and the windows were full of it. I don’t know how long I ran, but in the end, \nI fell, physically spent and sunken in despair. Raising my head, I saw it before \nme, waiting. So I stood and began to walk slowly towards it. It gave no \nreaction, simply awaiting my arrival. \n \nAs I got closer, I saw it more clearly: the heavy weave of the black woolen \ncloak; the shining porcelain of the mask; the hollow empty space behind the \neyes, inside the mouth. I faced my demon, and there was nothing there. In a fit \nof sudden rage, I struck out, my arm catching it on the side of what should \nhave been a head, but the cloth crumbled beneath my blow, the mask fell, and \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG108 – Monologue \n \n7 \n \nthe figure collapsed into a heap. Inside was a simple wooden stick, once \npropping the thing up, but now fallen to the ground and lying motionless. \n \nI went home quickly, my eyes downcast and furtive, and went to bed. I only \nonce looked out of my window at the street below. \n \nI don’t think it’s going to stop. Last night was the worst yet. I knew they were \ncoming, but how do you prepare for something like that? The first was there in \nthe audience before I even set foot on the stage. By my second entrance, there \nwere five that I could count. When I began my monologue, the whole \nauditorium was full of masks. All the world’s a stage, and it was empty, my only \ncompany the mocking grotesques of pantomimed humanity: the mewling \ninfant, the schoolboy, the lover, the soldier, the judge, each eliciting such a \nroar of nothing from them it took my breath away. Perhaps I should have \nstopped, fled the stage, quit acting entirely, but it was like a lonely avalanche \nand it flowed out of me in a wave. And I reached oblivion, an absence of \napplause that nearly deafened me. Sans everything. \n \nAfter the show, David came up to me. He wore his best director’s smile and \nmade as to shake my hand. His mouth moved, telling me how much this \nperformance had meant to him, how right the energy had been and how, \nwhatever I had tapped into within myself, I should reach for it again at the next \nperformance. I tried to listen, to nod, but his eyes were hollow and I knew that \nhe wasn’t really there. \n \nI have another performance tonight. In less than four hours, I will be on that \nstage again, speaking those empty lines to emptier ears. I could run, of course, \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG108 – Monologue \n \n8 \n \nbut I won’t. Where would I run to? All the world’s a stage, and I can’t escape \nmy monologue. \n \nStatement ends. \n \nMARTIN \n(Sighing, muttering) That wasn’t so bad. \n \nUh, not sure there is much to say about this one. John’s got us looking into \nanything that might involve theatres or the circus, but to be honest I don’t \nthink this is really what he’s looking for. The strangers here seem ... different, I \nguess? And it doesn’t have any clowns or dancing or ... skin. I wanted to ask \nTim about it, but he hasn’t been around much the last week or so, says he’s \nworking on something, which is ... I mean, it could be fine, I guess? He’s just \nquite ... intense at the moment. He scares me sometimes. \n \nTruth be told, none of us are doing great, but it’s actually Melanie who seems \n... something’s happened, I think. I don’t know. Her work’s been kind of off \nlately, and any time I talk to her, she just finds some reason to leave. I asked \nher to look into what happened to Adonis Biros, the actor from the statement, \nand she hasn’t bothered as far as I can tell. John called. He’s in America now, \nwanted her to help with something, but I had to make an excuse for her. He, \nhe doesn’t need that kind of thing on his mind right now. I just hope he gets \nback soon. \n \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG108 – Monologue \n \n9 \n \nYou know, saying it out loud, I, I think I’m actually really worried about \nMelanie. I... You know what, Basira knows her better than I do. I’ve been too \nawkward to ask, but I need to. I really think I need to— \n \n(Strange creaking noise, Martin exhales shakily) \n(Door opens) \n \nMARTIN \nBasira? Melanie? Tim? \n \n(Door closes) \n \nPETER \nMartin, isn’t it? \n \nMARTIN \n(Surprised and scared) It’s you! Don’t move. Uh ... Um ... Don’t you come any \nnearer. I, I have a knife. \n \nPETER \nDo you? That would seem ... wildly out of character, from what I’ve been told. \n \nMARTIN \nOk, but— You stay back. \n \nPETER", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 3, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 4407}}
