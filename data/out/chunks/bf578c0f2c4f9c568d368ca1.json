We can walk through these little worlds of terror, \nwatching them. Separate, and untouched. \nMARTIN \nThat’s not as comforting (slight chuckle) as you might think. \nARCHIVIST \nI like it better than the alternative. \n[Hissing static ends] \nMARTIN \nFair point! (small laugh) Okay, okay, uh, what else, what else, um... Oh! Um, \nuh, who was— uh, uh, phone! Um, w-who was calling me? \n[Hissing static starts] \nARCHIVIST \n...I think it was Annabelle Cane. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 164 – The Sick Village \n15 \nMARTIN \nHm. \nARCHIVIST \nThat’s- weird; I-I know the Web was wrapped around that phone, but, but I \ncan’t… see her. A-at all. At least with Georgie and Melanie I have a vague sense \nthey’re still alive, i-in London, and o— well, what was London. But Annabelle? \nNothing. \n[Hissing static ends] \nMARTIN \nHm. W-well, I’ll… I’ll ask her, next time she calls. \nARCHIVIST \n(Amused) Well, I know that’s a bad idea. \nMARTIN \n(Amused) What, do you? \nARCHIVIST \n...Okay, no, that one was a very reasonable guess. \nMARTIN \nHa! \nARCHIVIST \nAnything else? I’ll-I’ll be honest, I’m starting to feel a bit… self-conscious being \na post-apocalyptic Google? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 164 – The Sick Village \n16 \nMARTIN \nOkay, okay, just one more, but— it’s a big one. \nARCHIVIST \nOkay. \nMARTIN \nCan we turn the world back? \n[Hissing static starts] \nARCHIVIST \nWhoa. Um. I-if the fears are removed, yes, but th-they can’t be destroyed \nwhile there are still people to fear them, th-then they can’t be banished back \nto the space where they came from, it-it’s not there anymore, I-I- Oh, uh… \nMARTIN \nJ-J-J-John, what’s wrong?! \nARCHIVIST \nUh, it’s, uh, I’m sorry, trying to know things about them directly, i-i-it’s like— \n(exhale) God, it’s like looking into the Sun. \nMARTIN \nOkay, okay, okay. Alright, that’s alright. We can leave it. \n[Hissing static ends] \n(Archivist breaths heavily) \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 164 – The Sick Village \n17 \nARCHIVIST \nGood. Ow. \nMARTIN \nHey. (small chuckle) Hey, it’s okay, it’s okay. We’ll go slow for a while. \nARCHIVIST \nAlright. \nMARTIN \nYeah. Yeah, there’s no rush. \nOh, actually, what about Helen, where’s she these days? \n[Hissing static starts] \nARCHIVIST \nUh, She’s… (dry laugh) \nRight. Naturally. \nMARTIN \nWhat. What’s she doing? \nARCHIVIST \nMartin, turn around. \n[Martin turns] \nMARTIN \nOh, you’re kidding. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 164 – The Sick Village \n18 \nARCHIVIST \nWish I was! \nMARTIN \n(Sigh) Shall we... um... \n[They walk] \nARCHIVIST \nDo you want to do the honours? \nMARTIN \nNot really! \n[The Archivist knocks on a door] \n(Beat) \nMARTIN \nMaybe, no one’s home? \n[The door opens; it sounds the same as Helen’s door in the \nInstitute] \nHELEN \nHello, John! \n[Helen’s walks out of her corridor to join Martin and the \nArchivist outdoors, her footsteps turning from echoing to gritty; the \ndoor closes] \n[Hissing static, with a high-pitched tone, starts] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 164 – The Sick Village \n19 \nARCHIVIST \n(Sighing) How did you find us? \nHELEN \nOh! I thought you’d know everything by this point. \nARCHIVIST \nYes, I suppose I do. \n(Helen laughs) \nHmm. \nMARTIN \nAnd I don’t! So, care to enlighten me? \nARCHIVIST \nOh, yes, sorry, uh, The Distortion can always find anyone who has… crossed its \nthreshold. \nHELEN \nAnd that includes you, Martin! Remember? And please — my name is Helen. \nARCHIVIST \nLike you said, I can know everything now, including how much of a lie that \nreally is. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 164 – The Sick Village \n20 \nHELEN \nDon’t mistake complication for falsehood, dear Archivist. And remember, that \nknowledge is not the same thing as understanding! \nARCHIVIST \nWhat do you want. \nHELEN \nTo say hello! And check up on the happy couple. \n(She laughs) \nI always knew you crazy kids would make it work. \n(The Archivist sighs) \nMARTIN \nThanks. \nARCHIVIST \nMartin. Look, I’ve no interest in your… gloating. \nHELEN \n(Innocently) What would I have to gloat about? Much as I am delighted by this \nbrave new world in which we find ourselves, I can take no credit for it. This was \nall… you! \nARCHIVIST \nYou could have— You knew what was happening.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 4, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 4370}}
