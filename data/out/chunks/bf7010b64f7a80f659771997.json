The Magnus Archives. Episode one hundred and sixty-\nsix: \"The Worms.\" \n[Theme finishes] \n[Tape clicks on] \n[A wind blows, and there are faint muffled cries and screams \nof people] \n[Footsteps on gravel] \nMARTIN \n...So, are we going to talk about it, or...? \n[Backpack zippers jangle as they stop walking] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 166 – The Worms \n2 \nARCHIVIST \nWhat's to talk about? \nMARTIN \nWhat happened back there? What you did to Sa— \n(Beat) \nARCHIVIST \nGo on. Say it. \nMARTIN \nWhat you did to... that thing. \nARCHIVIST \nI… killed it. \nI, finally have the power, so I killed it. \nMARTIN \nYeah, but like how? I'm-I'm sorry, I just don't understand what actually \nhappened. \nARCHIVIST \nI… it's hard to put into words, lo-l, look, can we talk about it later, we're… \ncoming to a domain of the Buried, and I would really rather— \n[Hissing static, with a high-pitched tone, starts] \n[Sound of three knocks from behind wood] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 166 – The Worms \n3 \nMARTIN \nDid you..? \n(The Archivist sighs) \nARCHIVIST \nLook down, Martin. \nMARTIN \nOh. \nWait, what? \nARCHIVIST \nDon't... get too close. \n[The door creaks open] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nHello, Helen. \nHELEN \nOh, hello! In a better mood, are we? Feeling more secure now you've learned \nhow to kill? \nARCHIVIST \nSomething like that. \nMARTIN \nWill you tell me how he did it? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 166 – The Worms \n4 \nARCHIVIST \nMartin... \nMARTIN \nHe just keeps going all vague about it. \nHELEN \nOh, goodness. You see what you've done to the poor boy, John? He's coming \nto me for clear answers. \n(She snort-laughs) \nARCHIVIST \nShut up. \nHELEN \n(Giggle) It's very satisfying though, isn't it? Teasing out vague information? You \nsee why Elias got a kick out of it. \nARCHIVIST \nShut up! \nMARTIN \nJohn. \nHELEN \nYou're right, Martin. He is tetchy. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 166 – The Worms \n5 \nMARTIN \nI didn't say he was te— \nHELEN \nSo, so, an explanation. From little old me. \n(Beat) \nD'you mind, John? \nARCHIVIST \n(The Archivist starts to say something, then cuts himself off, sighs) \nGo right ahead. \nHELEN \nWe're all here, Martin. The Stranger, the Buried, the Desolation, all of us. But \nthe Eye still rules. All this fear is being performed for its benefit. And so, there \nare now exactly two roles available in this new world of ours: the watcher, and \nthe watched. Subject, and object. Those who are feared, and those who are \nafraid. \nAnd John, well… he is part of the Eye. A very important part. And he's able to, \nshall we say, shift its focus. Turn the one into the other. \nAnd for those of us whose very existence relies on being feared, well, to be \nturned into a victim destroys us utterly. And very, very painfully. \nARCHIVIST \nEnough. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 166 – The Worms \n6 \nHELEN \nYes, I suspect so. \nMARTIN \nSure. Okay, that's… I mean, that's really not that complicated John; I don't see \nwhy you were being so coy about it— \nARCHIVIST \nBecause I'm ashamed, Martin. \nMARTIN \n…Ashamed?! \nARCHIVIST \nYes! Ashamed of the fact that I just, destroyed the world and have been \nrewarded for it, the fact that, I can walk safe through all this horror I've created \nlike a fucking tourist, destroying whoever I please. The fact that I… enjoyed it \nand, the fact that there are so many others that I still want to revenge myself \non! \n(He exhales heavily) \nMARTIN \n...No, no I actually think you're good on that front. \nARCHIVIST \nWhat? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 166 – The Worms \n7 \nMARTIN \nYeah, I, I, I think we should go for it, get our murder on! \nARCHIVIST \nSorry, what? \nHELEN \n(Surprised delight) Yes, Martin! \nMARTIN \nTh-this isn't like it was before! We're not talking about innocent bystanders in \ncafes here, John; these things are… th-they're just evil, plain and simple, and \nright now they're torturing and tormenting everyone! \nIf you want to stop them and have the power to, then, then, then yeah, let's do \nit, let's go full Kill Bill! \nARCHIVIST \nI-I, I haven't seen it. \nHELEN \nOh, Martin, I am so proud of you. Can I come? \nARCHIVIST \n(Crosstalk) No. \nMARTIN \n(Crosstalk) No.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 0, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 4388}}
