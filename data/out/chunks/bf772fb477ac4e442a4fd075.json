Even if that hadn’t been the case, this \nwasn’t a broadcast, this was … This was inside my iPod. It would have to be \nsomething else, something cutting edge and new, but for miles around me was \nnothing but droning insects and dismal English summer. Nonetheless, when I \nstood in the centre of the hollow beneath that pylon’s rusted corpse, the \nnumbers came through crystal clear. \n“Five. Six. Four. Eight. Four. Six. Four. Seven. Four. Eight. Two. Seven.” \nWith each new number, my blood pounded and my heart raced, though I \ndidn’t have the faintest idea what they might have meant. I had actually \nbrought a notebook and pen, I now realised, just to write down the numbers. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 144 – Decrypted \n \n7 \n \nAnd so, I did. Four hours I spent, patiently jotting down the numbers. ‘The Skye \nBoat Song’ repeated every hour and a half, but I went through the sequence a \nfew times just to assure myself it didn’t change and I hadn’t missed any. \nWhen I finally took out my headphones, the sudden rush of summer evening \nsounds hit me like a wave, leaving me reeling and dizzy. It took me a moment \nto realize how late it was, and how sunburned I had gotten in the process. \nEverything ached and my heart pounded as I limped home. I’d been out easily \ntwice as long as any time before, but my dad didn’t say a word about it, just sat \nin front of the TV, laughing at some crappy panel show, smoking that pipe that \nleft the wallpaper yellow and peeling. I remember thinking he wasn’t content \nto just destroy himself; he seemed to have to take everything out around him. \nI didn’t return to the pylon for a long time, except to confirm that the numbers \nweren’t changing between days. I had them, though, and the numbers were all \nthat mattered. I didn’t know why. I’m sure there wasn’t a reason, not really, \nbut I knew it was in there. Realistically, it would be impossible to decode it \nwithout whatever key the cypher might have been using, and honestly, for the \nlongest time, it seemed to be. I did as much reading as I could on cryptography \nand codebreaking, and all of it seemed to point me towards one simple \nconclusion: breaking this code by myself was simply impossible. But I still tried. \nI spent weeks in my room, desperately applying every method I had available. \nNothing worked, but I didn’t stop. The alternative was looking after my dad, \nwhose recent breathing issues had left him more ratty than ever. \nSo, I worked myself into exhaustion instead, staring at those meaningless \nstrings of numbers until I almost collapsed and my eyes couldn’t focus on \nanything. And that was when I realised, it wasn’t the numbers. It wasn’t the \ncode. It’s what was behind the numbers, shifting and waiting and coming \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 144 – Decrypted \n \n8 \n \ntowards me like a tidal wave. And I knew what the message was, the urgent \nand terrible message about the destruction that was coming on the heels of \nmankind, about the cold and cruel warmongers who play their games of code \nand conspiracy, hidden behind the endless streams of numbers. And within \nthose numbers are all of our dooms, if you know how to read them. And I read \nthem. I read them all and saw the doom of everyone who lives and breathes \nand hopes for life and happiness. \nI fled the house. I ran, as fast as I could, to the pylon, the ruined place that \nknew all of the numbers, and I fell to my knees and wept. I begged it to spare \nus, to spare me, as I stared at the flesh I knew would redden and bubble and \nblister away to the bone beneath. I didn’t need headphones to hear the \nnumbers now. They were pouring from the air around me and threaded \nthrough my mind, and no matter how I begged, they would not stop. \nWhen I returned, the house was in ruins, the windows shattered and broken, \nglass strewn across the floor. There was nothing left of my dad, save a charred \nshadow on the wall, scorched through the plaster and into the now exposed \nbrick. All that was left of Mrs Whitshaw was powdered bone. \nThere are terrible things coming, things that if we knew of them would leave us \nweak and trembling with shuddering terror at the knowledge that they are \ncoming for all of us. We all made them, and their course is already plotted. You \ncan see them in the numbers, if you only learn how to read them. \nStatement ends. \n(Martin clears his throat and takes a deep breath)", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 3, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 4408}}
