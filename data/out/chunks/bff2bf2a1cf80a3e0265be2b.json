I saw nothing and no-one \nwith him, and his body seemed whole and undamaged. But I do have some \nidea as to why it happened. For as I filled those dead shelves with freshly \nbound volumes, I could not help but notice that every page was blank. I have \nsince checked with Payne’s, who I believe to be your preferred bookbinders, \nand I know that the books poor Albrecht was returning to the grave were not \nthe books that were taken. I hope they bring you much wisdom, Jonah, for the \ncost was dear enough. \nNothing stood in the way of my retreat, and I dragged Albrecht’s body back as \nfar as the coach. We left that awful place and I have endeavoured most acutely \nto forget the route. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 127 – Remains to be Seen \n \n8 \n \nBefore he was buried, I was able to secure permission to perform an autopsy. I \nhad some thought as to discovering the cause of his sudden, violent passing. \nDo I need to tell you what I found, Jonah? Do I need to detail what covered his \norgans, his bones, the inside of his skin? What clustered together in their \ndozens, and all turned as one to focus on me as I opened his chest, their pupils \nconstricting in the light, with irises of every hue and colour? Because whatever \nit was that did this to him, I know in my heart that it is your fault. \nI have had the body burned. Please do not write to me again. \nYour obedient servant, \nDoctor Jonathan Fanshawe \nARCHIVIST \nStatement ends. \nDisconcerting to find my namesake in a statement, especially one connected so \ndirectly to the Institute. I can only hope breaking faith with Jonah Magnus \ndidn’t go too badly for him. \nHm. Jonah Magnus. I’ve never really given much thought to him, not nearly as \nmuch as I should have. I suppose I had always hoped there was a chance he \nwas… innocent in all this. I know, I know. But I had… I had just hoped that \nmaybe the founding of the Institute was in earnest and not simply the \nfoundation stone for all the terrible things that have happened here. \nBut no. Whatever is happening now has its origins two hundred years ago, in \nthe work of an evil man. Exactly two hundred years, in fact – don’t think that \nlittle detail has evaded me. I don’t know the precise date the Institute was \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 127 – Remains to be Seen \n \n9 \n \nfounded, but I do know that it was in 1818. Something’s coming, I know it is, \nbut I just don’t know what I need to do. \n(Calls) Come in, Basira. \n[Door opens & closes] \nBASIRA \nI was waiting for you to finish. \nARCHIVIST \nI know. \nBASIRA \n… \nI don’t like that you’ve started doing that. \nARCHIVIST \nI, I know. \nBASIRA \nHmm. \nARCHIVIST \nHow’s Melanie? \nBASIRA \nHow do you think? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 127 – Remains to be Seen \n \n10 \n \nARCHIVIST \nI, uh, I should probably talk to— \nBASIRA \nYou should probably stay as far away as possible. She doesn’t want to see you. \nARCHIVIST \nNo. No, o-o-of course. Um, she has … \nBASIRA \nBut she did want me to... apologise. From her. For the shoulder. \nARCHIVIST \nOh, it, it’s fine. Scalpel wounds, they heal quickly. \nBASIRA \nHmm. \nARCHIVIST \nToo quickly, really. \nBASIRA \nAlready? \nARCHIVIST \nJust another scar for the collection. \nBASIRA \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 127 – Remains to be Seen \n \n11 \n \nHmm. \nARCHIVIST \n… \nDo, do you think it worked? Is she— \nBASIRA \nI don’t know. She seems more... coherent, I guess. And you did get an apology. \nARCHIVIST \n(Softly) Yeah. \nBASIRA \nShe says she can cry now, which is, um, progress? I think? She's still angry, but \nshe hasn’t attacked anyone. Not even sure she has it in her anymore. \nARCHIVIST \nWell, that’s, that’s good. \nBASIRA \n(Unconvinced) Mmm. \n… \nSo. You can’t be killed by a collapsing building. Major injuries scar up fast. You \ncan force the truth out of people and knowledge pops into your head \nwhenever you need it. \nARCHIVIST \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 127 – Remains to be Seen \n \n12 \n \nYes. I, I think that, that about covers it. \nBASIRA \nAnd what was that you were doing yesterday? \nARCHIVIST \nWhen? \nBASIRA \nYou were sat on the floor for like four hours. \nARCHIVIST \nOh. No, I was, uh, I was… listening. You know, trying to see if any of the \nstatements... called to me. \nBASIRA \nAnd? \n[Paper rustles] \nBrilliant. \nARCHIVIST \nLook, I don’t know, Basira. I hope I’m still human, but it— but it’s seeming \nmore and more unlikely. \nBASIRA \nI didn’t ask.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 3, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 4351}}
