You know? \nMARTIN \nNot really. \nDAISY \nMelanie’s out, and John and Basira are still off. Bit worried, but they can take \ncare of themselves, you know? \nMARTIN \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 142 – Scrutiny \n \n13 \n \nAgain not really. No-one really talks to me anymore. \nDAISY \nCos they reckon you’re working for the bad guy? \nMARTIN \nPretty much. \nDon’t you? \nDAISY \nOh, I mean, you’re definitely working for something evil. But so are we. \nMARTIN \nYeah. Seems there’s plenty to go around these days. \nIt doesn’t bother you? \nDAISY \nDidn’t used to. \nMARTIN \nAnd now? \nDAISY \nBothers me less than trying to go alone. At least now it’s on my terms. Better \nthan being blackmailed into it. \nMARTIN \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 142 – Scrutiny \n \n14 \n \nPfft. I mean, yeah, I guess... \n… \nThey told you about Elias, right? \nDAISY \nYeah. Basira said. Don’t like him being alive. Trying not to think about it too \nmuch. Don’t want to get too angry, start to hear the blood. \nMARTIN \nSure. \nDAISY \nCan’t hear his lies from prison though. So that’s something. \nMARTIN \nI thought you believed him? You were doing all of his dirty work. \nDAISY \nWell, wasn’t willing to call his bluff. Not the same thing as believing. Just too \nbig a risk. \nMARTIN \nNot for Melanie. \nDAISY \nWell, maybe she was the only one with any sense. Even if he was telling the \ntruth, if we all… died... There are worse things. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 142 – Scrutiny \n \n15 \n \nMARTIN \nHow was it? \nDAISY \nDon’t want to talk about it. \nMARTIN \nI listened to your old statement. Wasn't your partner down there? \nDAISY \nYeah. Didn't find him. \nMARTIN \nYou don't want to get him? \nDAISY \nI'm not going back. \nMARTIN \nHuh. I’d have thought you’d’ve at least tried— \nDAISY \n(Sharply) I said I don’t want to talk about it. \nMARTIN \nI know. Not nice being interrogated, is it? \nDAISY \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 142 – Scrutiny \n \n16 \n \nI... Oh. \nMARTIN \nYeah. \nDAISY \n… \nI’m sorry, Martin. \nMARTIN \nIt’s alright. It wasn’t you. Not really. \nDAISY \nNo, it was. I hate a lot of what I did back then. Doesn’t mean I’m not \nresponsible for it. Doesn’t mean it wasn’t me. \nMARTIN \nAnyway… So what’s this field trip they’re on? \nDAISY \nThey, uh, they didn’t tell you? \nMARTIN \nNo, I— What? Daisy, where have they gone? \nDAISY \nYou know that town in Norway? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 142 – Scrutiny \n \n17 \n \nMARTIN \nWhat? No… Wai— Wh-What? You don’t mean Ny-Ålesund? \nDAISY \nYeah. They reckon there’s a ritual they need to... you know. \nMARTIN \nYeah, but Peter didn’t even me— I don’t believe this. \nDAISY \nSorry. Shouldn’t have said anything. \nMARTIN \nNo, no, it’s— Thank you. I just— \n[Agitated clatter] \nFor god’s sake, can he not just stay safe for like, like ten minutes?! \nDAISY \nI don’t think that’s an option for him anymore. \nMARTIN \nYeah, I mean, sure. But he just... he doesn’t think! He always just immediately \ncharges straight off into danger with whatever, whatever half-arsed plan oc-\noccurs to him at the time! I don’t get it! \nDAISY \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 142 – Scrutiny \n \n18 \n \nWhat’s to get? \nMARTIN \nWhat? \nDAISY \nI, I mean, it’s pretty standard stuff. \nMARTIN \nWhat? \nDAISY \nUsed to see it all the time back in the force, especially with the sectioned. Not \nlike there’s ‘normal’ trauma, you know, but it’s pretty common. The most \nimportant thing becomes control, engaging on your own terms. Even when it’s \nstupid or dangerous. Anything to not feel helpless. \nMARTIN \nOh god... \nDAISY \nAnd of course for John’s there’s survivor’s guilt in there too. He thinks he’s not \nhuman. Makes him very... self-destructive. \nMARTIN \nYeah, well, we’ve all had trauma. \nDAISY \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 142 – Scrutiny \n \n19 \n \nAnd everyone’s changed. \nMARTIN \nYeah. \nI suppose. \nYou’re... You’re pretty observant, you know. \nDAISY \nDetective, remember. \nMARTIN \nYeah, you did mention. Would have thought Basira would have had more \nsense, though. \nDAISY \nWhen Basira and I were partners, I’d see this happen sometimes. She can read \na situation like no-one I know, always seems to know the right move, but for all \nher research she never wants to put a plan together. I think she just hates all \nthe unknowns, the variables, contingencies... If she spots an advantage she’ll \ngrab it and trust herself to figure out the details as she goes. It’s worked so far. \nMARTIN \nI mean, I guess. It still sounds really dangerous. \nDAISY \nYeah. Wanted to go with them. Protect them, but... (Sigh) Life’s always more \ncomplicated than that, isn’t it?", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 4, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 4488}}
