I wasn’t just remembering Carl wrong. I did not know the \nperson who was using his name. It wasn’t Carl. It just wasn’t. \nI was signed off work at the time, and mostly spent my days just kicking around \nthe house, but a about a week after the wedding it occurred to me that, when \nmy grandmother passed away a few years before, my parents had asked me to \ngo through her old photos, see which ones we might like to keep. I’d taken \nthem, but had never actually gotten around to going through them, and they \nshould still be in the loft. Not having anything better to do, and still a little bit \noff-balance after Adam’s wedding, I pulled down the ladder, and went to fetch \nthem. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG078 – Distant Cousin \n5 \n \nThe attic space was warm and dry, with that thin film of dust in the air that \nisn’t quite enough to set you coughing but leaves your mouth feeling dry and \nsticky. I pushed away a few plastic crates of old comics, until I found the brittle \ncardboard box that held the pictures. My grandmother had loved her camera, \nand I remember her shelves were always full of tiny canisters of film, but it \nwasn’t until I started to look through them that I realised quite how many \npictures she’d actually taken. \nThere were hundreds, maybe thousands, in there, and going through them I \nwatched myself grow from a squash-faced toddler to a chubby little boy and a \nspotty, scowling teenager. And alongside me was my brother Adam, and \nanother child, who I did not recognise, but whose dark hair seemed to match \nthe man I had met at the wedding. \nBy the end, my whole body was shaking. Not because of all those pictures of a \nstrange child playing in the garden with us, but because of the two – only two \n– pictures I found of Carl. The Carl I remembered, with light brown hair cut \nshort and an almost piggish nose. The second of those photos looked like it had \nonly been taken moments after a different picture of us playing tag, but that \none showed the other child where Carl should have been. Where I knew he \nhad been. I stared at those photographs for what must have been an hour or \nmore, completely unable to make any sense of what I was looking at. \nAt some point, I was roused by a knock on the front door. It wasn’t hard, or \nimpatient, just a light series of taps. As though whoever was on the other side \nhad no doubt that was in, and was politely trying to attract my attention. I put \nthe pictures back quickly, and hurried down to answer it. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG078 – Distant Cousin \n6 \n \nStanding on the other side was my new cousin Carl. He smiled that same \nyellow smile, and said that he’d been sad to see me leave Adam’s wedding so \nsoon, and that since we lived so close together, it seemed rude not to drop by. \nI tried to tell him to leave, to demand to know where Carl was, but my heart \nwas beating so fast and I was just too scared. He walked calmly past me, into \nthe house, and I closed the door behind him. \nWhat followed was the longest afternoon of my life. I sat in an armchair and he \ntook the sofa opposite, sitting stiffly in a way that seemed far too still. Neither \nof us said a word. He just stared at me, smile still wide and something twinkling \nin his eyes that might have been amusement. Or triumph. He showed no desire \nto make any sort of conversation, and I was too terrified to say anything at all. \nI just kept thinking, what had this man done to Carl, and could he do it to me? I \ntried to look at him, to really look, but the more I attempted to focus on him \nproperly, the more my eyes seemed to slide off him. Like one of those optical \nillusions that only comes into focus when you’re looking at a different part of \nthe picture. \nAt one point, it almost seemed like his neck was too long, but when I looked \nagain it was normal. The only two things I knew for sure was that I had never \nbeen as scared as I was just then, and that I did not know this man. \nWhen evening finally came, he stood up. He nodded at me and told me how \nmuch he had enjoyed his visit. “We must do this again,” he said, “and soon.” \nThen he left. I stayed sat in that chair and I cried. \nIt was full dark when I was broken out of my despair by another knock on the \ndoor. This one was harsh and jarring, and I could hear the doorframe rattle \nslightly at the impact. Standing there was another man I’d never seen before.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 2, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 4405}}
