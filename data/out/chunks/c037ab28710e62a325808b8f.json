I reached forward, staying as far from this \nthing as the nozzle would let me, and I pushed it into one of the larger holes. It \nsank in with almost no resistance at all. I took a deep breath and pulled the \ntrigger, spraying the insecticide dust deep into the mass. \nThe effect was immediate. The whole thing started to pulse and spasm, the \nspongy flesh of it throbbing and bubbling like some sort of vile putty. It began \nto grow in size, blossoming out and covering the rest of the nozzle, reaching \nout for me. And then it began to scream. Not the sound of air escaping or a \nbuzzing that sounded like screaming, the weird nest thing was letting out a \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 055 – Pest Control \n \n14 \n \nlong, warbling cry of anger and pain. I dropped the pump and was down the \nladder so fast I almost fell into the flat below. \nI could still hear it as I reached the door to the corridor. I threw it open, only to \nbe confronted by the face of Arthur Nolan, the landlord, staring at me with a \nlook of disappointment. He nodded and began to walk down the hall. I \nfollowed him, desperate for answers, but he just ignored my questions about \nwhat the hell was going on or what that thing was and kept walking down the \nstairs to his own flat. At one point, he shook his head and mumbled something \nabout hoping it wouldn’t get this far, but he didn’t seem to be saying it to me. \nAs soon as the door opened, I became aware of how uncomfortably warm flat \n1 was. The air was thick and dry and made my throat feel a bit scratchy. The \nlandlord continued to ignore my presence and walked over to an old armchair \nin the centre of the room. As he did so, he started to unbutton his denim shirt. \nMore so than anything else that had happened, that was the thing that finally \nstopped me in confusion. I couldn’t understand what he was doing. As he sat \ndown, his shirt flapped open and I saw what looked to be an intricate scar on \nhis chest. If I had to guess what it was, I’d have said it looked like a stylised \nflame, but it also made me think of a face contorted in pain. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 055 – Pest Control \n \n15 \n \nTime seemed to move slowly as he reached for the ash tray on the arm of the \nchair and picked up a pack of matches. He struck one and, without even \nlooking at me, he gently pressed the small flame to the centre of the scar. His \nflesh caught fire immediately, the flames spreading across his body like rippling \nwater. The armchair caught, then the floor, and then I was running out of the \nbuilding before the rolling inferno covered me as well. \nThis time, I didn’t drive away. I stood there and I watched it burn until the fire \nbrigade arrived. It was when the fire hit that attic space of the top floor – \nwhere I knew that awful nest still sat – that was when I smelled it, the same \ngrotesque stench that had come from that oily, fevered man three years \nbefore. At the time, I didn’t really connect the two – I was too busy trying to \ncomprehend what had just happened and, when trucks from the ECDC showed \nup to put me in quarantine, it slipped my mind entirely. \nThey were surprisingly forthcoming about Jane Prentiss and what had \nhappened, and after an extensive debriefing, they actually offered me a job. \nApparently, disease control and pest control often go hand in hand, and I’ve \nbeen working for them since. Most of the jobs have been mundane, a couple \nslightly weird, but nothing like those two. \nARCHIVIST \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 055 – Pest Control \n \n16 \n \nSo, why make your statement now? \nJORDAN \nWhen I helped incinerate her body, I smelled it again. Like before. Took me a \nwhile to piece the two together, but I thought you should know. \nARCHIVIST \nAre you saying there might be more out there like her? \nJORDAN \nGod, I hope not. I don’t know. The man from the ant house, he wasn’t like her, \nnot at all, but that smell when they burned... I think they’re connected, \nsomehow. And that scares me. \nARCHIVIST \nYes... yes, it rather scares me too. \n[Tape clicks off.] \nARCHIVIST \nMr Kennedy’s statement has left me somewhat rattled. While I am always glad \nof any further closure to the case of Jane Prentiss, this seems to come with the \nrather serious caveat that she might not have been working alone.
