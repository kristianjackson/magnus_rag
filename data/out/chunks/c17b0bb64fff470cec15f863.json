The Magnus Archives. Episode one hundred and \nseventy-eight: \"The Processing Line.\" \n[Theme finishes] \n[Tape clicks on] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 178 – The Processing Line \n2 \n[Sounds of industrial processing echoing in large spaces; moving \nbodies; and the slow regular sound of hundreds of feet taking \nsynchronised steps forward] \n[Speaking voices echo in the corridors] \n[Footsteps] \nBASIRA \nYou’re sure she came through here? \nARCHIVIST \nHave I steered you wrong so far? \nBASIRA \nI don’t know, do I? We haven’t actually found her yet. \nARCHIVIST \nWe’re getting closer. \nBASIRA \nGreat. \nMARTIN \nWould you both just keep it down, please? \nARCHIVIST \nThey’re not aware of us, Martin. I keep telling you. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 178 – The Processing Line \n3 \nMARTIN \nYeah, I know, but it’s not okay to talk as though they’re not there. They’re still \npeople. \nARCHIVIST \nUh um… Technically, a lot of them actually aren’t people. \n[Basira surprise brings everyone to a halt] \nBASIRA \nCome again? \nARCHIVIST \nA-A lot of them are created by this place as, uh, set dressing, I suppose? This \ndomain, the fear of it requires these… queues, these… this intricate hateful \nbureaucracy of hundreds of thousands of doomed souls — it needs far more \nthan the number of people who actually ended up here. \nMARTIN \nWait, wait, wait. So… so it just... makes the rest of them up? \nARCHIVIST \nEr, maybe one in a hundred or so are actually real. The rest are there to make \nthose people’s fears more acute. \nMARTIN \nThat’s… ugh, that’s somehow more disturbing. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 178 – The Processing Line \n4 \nBASIRA \nHow do you tell which is which? \nARCHIVIST \nI mean, you could ask me, I suppose. B-But I don’t really see the point. Would it \nhelp you to know whose suffering is real and whose is just a grim reflection? \n(Beat) \nBASIRA \nNo. \nARCHIVIST \nWell there you go then. \nMARTIN \nWhy are they queuing? \nARCHIVIST \nUh, I mean, I’ve been keeping us away from those rooms, but... Well, it’s a \nfactory of The Flesh, Martin. Use your imagination. \nMARTIN \n…No. No I don’t think I will. \nARCHIVIST \nWise. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 178 – The Processing Line \n5 \nBASIRA \nSo who’s in charge here? \nARCHIVIST \nNot anyone you’re familiar with; we won’t be meeting them. \n(Beat) \nMARTIN \nYou’re not going to... y’know? \n(Martin vocalises an explosion) \nARCHIVIST \nNo. Even if I wanted to he’s in the, uh… Main Processing Room. And believe me \nwhen I say that’s… not somewhere you want to be. \nMARTIN \nYeah. I guess. \nGod, I hate all of these… loose ends. \nARCHIVIST \nI’m sorry. \nMARTIN \nIts-it’s fine. We’ll just have to tie them all up in one go. \nARCHIVIST \nHm? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 178 – The Processing Line \n6 \nMARTIN \nAround Elias’ neck. \nARCHIVIST \nAh. \nBASIRA \n(Impatiently) Which way? \nARCHIVIST \nLeft. Just up ahead. Although… uh, um, actually, you might want to head \nthrough that door and wait. \nBASIRA \nAgain? Already? \nARCHIVIST \nThere’s a lot of fear in this place. \n(Annoyed sigh from Basira) \nMARTIN \nWhat’s in there? \nARCHIVIST \nTool cupboard. Safe enough place to wait. \nBASIRA \nFine.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 0, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 3826}}
