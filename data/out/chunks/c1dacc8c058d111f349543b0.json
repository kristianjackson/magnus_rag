When I told her about the loss and the note, she sat down, clearly \ntrying to process everything. She didn’t seem particularly broken up over the \nfact that her husband was most likely dead, something that was quickly \nconfirmed as she started moving on to talking about savings and life insurance. \nThat’s when I should have taken my payment and gone. If I hadn’t gotten \ngreedy, I’d still have my arm. \nSo, I was all set to leave, when Nicola asked me how long I thought it was going \nto be before they found a body. Stupidly, I said that if the Ukrainians were any \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG049 – The Butcher’s Window \n7 \n \ngood, there probably wouldn’t be a body to find. At this, Nicola seemed to \npanic slightly, asking a lot of questions about missing persons and being \ndeclared legally dead without a body, which is a long, drawn-out headache. \nShe clearly didn’t want to wait and asked me to try and find some evidence \nthat Hector was dead. I said, “No”, of course. Then she named a price that... \nwell, let’s just say Hector Laredo’s life insurance policy must have been a hell of \na thing.

I said, “Yes”. \nSo, the next day I found myself in Stockwell, at the address listed on the note, \nstaring at a butcher’s shop. No name was written over the front, but the \ndisplay of chilled carcasses and slabs of meat in the window made it perfectly \nclear what it was. I started to wonder if the Ukrainian mafia was involved in \nsome full-on Sweeney Todd body disposal, but quickly reminded myself that \neven if, and it was a big if, they were killing and disposing of bodies there, it \ndidn’t mean they were selling the meat to the public. That would be a massive \nand unnecessary risk and organised crime wasn’t big on unnecessary risk. \nIt was a sunny day and the smell of the hot tarmac mixed with the odour of \nraw meat that drifted from the door. It had a ‘Closed’ sign displayed \nprominently, despite the time of morning, and there were no interior lights on. \nI couldn’t see anything inside except the old, poorly refrigerated meat hanging \nin the window, dripping silently onto the trays below. I reminded myself how \nmuch money was on the line and tried the handle. To my surprise, it was \nunlocked. I slipped inside the shadowed storefront before anyone spotted me. \nThe smell was rancid, but not as strong as I had expected. A quick glance \naround the place told me why – aside from the window display, the room was \ndevoid of meat.
