This isn’t some extension, some limb reaching out to \nsnatch the wayward or the trusting. This domain, this magnificent building is \nme. \n[Helen stretches and sighs contentedly as her building form does likewise] \nHELEN (CONT’D) \nYou’re welcome here. We’ll be quite safe with you travelling through me. As \nlong as neither of us does anything silly. \n[Hissing static starts] \nOr you could just stand there glowering, that’s fine too. \nARCHIVIST \nI’m trying to ‘know’ if there’s another route I can take. \nHELEN \nAnd? \nARCHIVIST \nTurns out there is, actually. But it is rather full of spiders. \n[Hissing static ends] \n[Footsteps start walking away] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 187 – Checking Out \n \n7 \nHELEN \nOh don’t be such a sourpuss! \n[Footsteps stop] \n(Small sigh from the Archivist) \nHELEN (CONT’D) \nIt’ll be fun. I promise. \n(A heavy sigh from the Archivist) \nARCHIVIST \nAlright. \n[Footsteps on gravel until the Archivist crosses Helen’s threshold, \nand the door creaks shut eerily; it sounds the same as Helen’s door \nin the Institute] \n[The piano muzak continues as he enters a hotel foyer; people \ndining nearby chatter; a reception bell sometimes dings] \n[The Archivist stops walking] \n[Helen’s voice comes from all around] \nHELEN \nOooh! (shudders) It feels different… to last time. \nARCHIVIST \nDifferent how? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 187 – Checking Out \n \n8 \nHELEN \nThe tape recorder feels more, um... awake. \nARCHIVIST \nOh. Oh joy. Come on. \n[Footsteps as he begins walking] \n[Hissing static starts] \nHELEN \n(As if having eaten someone foul) Ooh… Eeeeeeurgh! \nARCHIVIST \nWhat? \n[He stops and presses a button] \n[Hissing static ends] \nHELEN \nEurgh. You just— blergh... You just knew the way through, well, me. And, \neurgh (sniffs) it’s not a pleasant feeling. No. I do not like that. Not at all. \n[Elevator doors open, and the Archivist steps in] \nARCHIVIST \nWell tough, I’m not going to trust you to be my guide. \nHELEN \n(Exasperated) Would it kill you? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 187 – Checking Out \n \n9 \nARCHIVIST \nIt’s killed plenty of others. \n[The doors close; he selects a floor; the elevator starts moving] \n[Helen’s voice sounds as if through tinny elevator speakers] \n(Beat) \nHELEN \nYou really don’t like me, do you? \nARCHIVIST \nNo. \nHELEN \nAnd you never have. \nARCHIVIST \nNot really. \nHELEN \nEven though I saved you from Michael. \nARCHIVIST \nYou were Michael. \nHELEN \nArgh. I’m The Distortion, as was Michael, but I am not him, and never have \nbeen. Surely you know all this by now, what with your shiny new eye powers? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 187 – Checking Out \n \n10 \nARCHIVIST \nIt’s not about what I know. It’s about what I feel. \nHELEN \n(Disparagingly) Oh, what do you feel? \nARCHIVIST \nI liked Helen. \n[The elevator stops] \nHELEN \nI am Helen. \nARCHIVIST \nThe real one. \n[The doors open and the Archivist enters a carpeted corridor] \n[Helen’s voice changes resonance again] \nHELEN \n…Helen-Classic. \nARCHIVIST \nSure. \n[As the elevator doors close the musak finishes] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 187 – Checking Out \n \n11 \n[As the Archivist walks, he passes cheap buzzing lighting and faint \nmuffled hotel room activity; the Helen-building creaks every so \noften] \nHELEN \nThat doesn’t make any sense! You barely met her — you had half an hour \ntogether, and she spent most of that time ranting about mazes! She was \npositively delirious with paranoia! \nARCHIVIST \nTrue. But as you’ll recall, I was pretty paranoid myself at that point. \nHELEN \nSo what? You saw yourself in her? A sad reflection? A possible future? \nARCHIVIST \nMaybe. \nHELEN \nOh John! This existence can be wonderful, if you just let it. \nARCHIVIST \n(Sadly) I know. \n[He continues to walk] \nHELEN \nFor what it’s worth, I really don't think you would have liked her, if you’d \nknown her better, I mean.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 1, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 3850}}
