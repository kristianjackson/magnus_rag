Episode seventy-three. Police \nLights. \nARCHIVIST \nHere. \nBASIRA \nThanks. \nARCHIVIST \nI assume it didn’t go well, then? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG073 – Police Lights \n2 \n \nBASIRA \nWe lost Altman. Just... wasn’t... paying attention. Don't know what they’re \ngoing to tell his family. Guess it could have been worse, though, if I hadn’t \ntalked to you first. So thanks. \nARCHIVIST \nI’m surprised you're here. Surely you have a lot of paperwork after something \nlike that? A lot of forms to sign? \nBASIRA \nThey’ve given us a few days ‘compassionate leave’. I think they just want us \nout of the way while they figure out the official version of what happened. \nARCHIVIST \nWell, I’d like to hear the real one, if you’re ready? \nBASIRA \nYeah. How much context do you need? \nARCHIVIST \nYou said it started with a kidnapping case? \nBASIRA \nYeah. Callum Brodie. Twelve... twelve years old. Disappeared from his home in \nDalston three weeks ago. Sitter was asleep when the mother came home, the \nfront door was open, there was no sign of him. \nThere was no forced entry so it started out as a missing persons case, but they \ngot a witness claiming he’d seen three unknown figures entering the Brodies’ \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG073 – Police Lights \n3 \n \nhome that night, so it was kicked up to Serious Crime. There was some back \nand forth with Kidnap Squad since no ransom demand had been made, but not \nmuch progress in terms of finding the kid. \nI only found out about all this when we were suiting up yesterday. The Brodie \ncase had nothing to do with my department or my borough. When me and \nDaisy got the call that we were being brought in for an operation to recover \nthe kid, it was... it was totally out of the blue. The sergeant in charge had to \nbrief us in the van. I had no idea why we’d been called in until I looked at the \nother officers involved and saw a good few of them... they were fellow signees \nof a Section 31. Whatever we were heading towards, it was going to be weird. I \nthink the sergeant in charge must have been sectioned as well, but I didn’t \nknow him. It’s not too surprising, though. I mean, it’s not like any of us have a \nfull list of sectioned officers but one must exist somewhere. \nIt looked like most of the others had made the same connection, and none of \nus were feeling right about it. I mean, we had a counter terrorist firearms \nsquad with us, which didn’t exactly put my mind at ease. That said, I wasn’t \nexactly sad we might be getting some sectioned firearms officers, but it was \njust a lot, you know? The briefing was pretty short. We were told that Callum \nBrodie had been found and it was suspected he was being held by a man \nnamed Maxwell Rayner, with an unknown number of accomplices. There were \nsuspicions that there might be cult involvement. That’s when I phoned you. \nARCHIVIST \nAnd did the lights help at all? \nBASIRA", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 0, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 3312}}
