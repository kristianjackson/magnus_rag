Statement recorded by subject, February \n18th, 2017. \nStatement begins. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG081 – A Guest for Mr Spider \n2 \n \nARCHIVIST (STATEMENT) \nI have been thinking a lot over the last couple of days about how this began. \nFor me, that is. I cannot help but feel that hand in hand with the death of \nJurgen Leitner came the death of the lens through which I viewed the world. \nEven in the depths of my paranoia, something I now attribute to the presence \nof… of the being that was posing as Sasha, like a grain of sand behind my eye, \nrubbing and irritating, but with no clear cause. \nEven then, I knew how the world worked. There were supernatural things in \nthe world, but they were rare – isolated and exaggerated, vastly outnumbered \nby wild tales and drunken imaginings. The one name I held in my mind as a \ntrue source of evil was Jurgen Leitner, and I knew him as the worst of it, for it \nwas his name that had marked the encounter that scarred my youth. And of \ncourse, in my heart, I knew that no-one else could have possibly seen anything \nas horrible as I had. Well, maybe I could have named one person, but… I \nwatched him disappear forever. \nBut now I know what Jurgen Leitner truly was. A spoiled child, playing with \nforces he barely understood, calling himself a jailor to things he couldn’t even \nconceptualise. There is so much more horror in this world than I had ever \ndreamt possible. And my suffering, I now know, pales in comparison to what \nhas befallen others far more innocent than I. But perhaps not for long. \nThese beings that lurk beyond us know my name and, if I understand Leitner \ncorrectly, one of them has already claimed me. The Eye. Appropriate, I \nsuppose. I do not know how many of them there are, or precisely how they \nseparate, but I do know that the Eye – Beholding – was not the first that I \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG081 – A Guest for Mr Spider \n3 \n \nencountered in my life. The first was the Spider. The Web. And I have no idea \nwhat that might mean. \nI was eight years old when my grandmother gave me the book. No-one ever \nbelieves me when I tell them my age. I don’t know if it’s the already greying \nhair or something in my demeanour, but they always act surprised when I \nmention being a child in the Nineties. I will admit the last few years have aged \nme considerably. Regardless, it must have been a year or two since the library \nwas destroyed, though I had no inkling of it at the time. \nMy parents had passed away when I was too young to really remember them; \nmy father of an accidental fall when I was two, and my mother a couple of \nyears later from complications during routine surgery. My extended family \nweren’t close and I had no siblings, so I ended up living with my grandmother, \na kind enough woman, but she had already raised her children, and the \nresentment she felt at having to raise another was never something she \ncompletely managed to hide from me. It seemed to mingle with her grief, so \nthe sadness over her own lost son would manifest in recriminations and \nbitterness. \nSaying this aloud I worry I’m painting too bleak a picture of my grandmother. \nShe cared for me as well as she was able, and whatever her private feelings \nmight have been, she did try her best. \nAnd I was hardly an easy child to deal with. While I may not have shared the \ninclinations of my peers towards active mischief, I was precocious and \nimpatient, quick to talk back, and even quicker to wander off whenever I grew \nbored. By the time I was eight, the police had had to return me from my \nexplorations at least three times, and my grandmother swore that if it", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 0, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 4385}}
