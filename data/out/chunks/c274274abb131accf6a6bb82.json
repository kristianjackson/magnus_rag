The door to the Medical Science building stood open; it \nwas a bright day, but the hall stood dark. Alex looked at me, just once, as if \nasking whether I was sure about doing this. I wasn’t, but… I still nodded. \nWe stepped inside. The building was cool and quiet, with just the faint drone \nof the air conditioning in the background. I’d never actually been inside before, \nbut Alex’s steps were confident in their direction, even if she wasn’t confident \nin her purpose. Finally, she pushed open a pair of doors to one of the teaching \nrooms, and… I saw the scene she had described. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG094 – Dead Woman Walking \n8 \n \nThere were the students, lying on the floor. But not just students. I saw faculty \nand even a policeman slumped there like the others. What Alex hadn’t \nmentioned was how grey they all seemed. Not in the sense they were sickly, \nbut… like they’d had the colour simply drained away from them. And knelt in \nthe middle was the woman. Her skin seemed grey as well, but in her it was \nclearly the colour of death. It didn’t matter that her ribs rose and fell like she \nwas breathing, even if Alex hadn’t told me before there would have been no \ndoubt in my mind what she was. \nHer eyes settled on us with that same disinterested stare. No-one moved. Not \nus, not the corpse, and not the bodies on the floor. There was nothing but the \nsound of breathing, and maybe the faintest whimpering cry from somewhere \namong the fallen. Then, very slowly, without any sense of urgency, the dead \nwoman began to stand up. I remember what it was like only vaguely, like trying \nto describe a dream long after you’ve woken up from it. \nAs the woman got closer, I could see something in Alex tighten, wind so taut \nthat it finally snapped. She lunged forward, grabbed the corpse by its \nshoulders, and began to scream into its face. What did it want? What had it \ndone? Demanding answers. The dead woman with the shaved head ignored \nher grip, leaned close to her neck and opened her mouth. \nFor a moment I had visions of teeth sinking into Alex’s flesh, of arterial spray \ncoating the clean, white laminate, but all that passed between them was a \nwhisper. Something soft spoken into Alex’s ear. Her arms dropped to her sides, \nand she turned to look at me. \nHer eyes were different. They were still hers, and I could tell they still knew \nme, but something in them was gone. As my gaze met hers, Alex gave a simple, \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG094 – Dead Woman Walking \n9 \n \nsmall shrug, so slowly, it was as if every ounce of will she had went into that \none small gesture. Her head drooped, staring at the floor, and she gently \nlowered herself down to lie there. \nAnd just like that, I was on my own. It feels strange to think that even then I \ncouldn’t find the strength to run. If I’m feeling generous to myself, I try to \nbelieve it’s because I was unwilling to abandon Alex, or maybe the thing had \nsome power to keep me there, but honestly, it was fight, flight or freeze. And I \nfroze. \nI saw the dead woman approaching me. Smelt the chemicals that kept her \nfrom rotting, saw her lean towards me, saw her lips begin to form words. In \ndesperation I slammed my hands over my ears and shut my eyes, willing myself \nnot to hear, not to understand. As far as defences go, it was basically nothing, \nbut I still think it saved me, at least a bit. I still heard the words. \n“The moment that you die will feel exactly the same as this one.” \nAnd in an instant I understood. There’s no… difference between the present \nand the future, no other me that will suffer the indignity of death while I live \non. It’s all a single moment, and there’s… there’s no difference between that \nlast moment that ushers us out into oblivion and the one we experience now. \nThe promise of a cold and lonely eternity in the grave would have been a \nmercy; at least it would be eternal. But everything ends, even the universe, \neven time. And… that means it has always already ended. \nI felt every feeling within me boil up: anger, despair, joy, hope, fear. Especially \nfear. They overwhelmed me, and burned up with the monumental realisation \nof the scale we existed on. Not the meaningless vastness of the universe, but \nthe… the smallness of it.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 3, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 4372}}
