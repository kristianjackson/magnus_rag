Do your ‘knowing’ thing and then we can— \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 184 – Like Ants \n13 \nARCHIVIST \nWith my eyes. \nMARTIN \n…Okay. But just so you know, the tunnels to get there are absolutely craw— \nYeah, okay. Yes, no, yes, you already know. \nLead on. \n[Tape clicks off] \n[Tape clicks on] \n[The echoes of ants swarming in a larger chamber and sounds of a \nperson flailing] \n(Jordan wails plaintively and hopelessly) \nMARTIN \nChrist... \nJohn? \nJORDAN \nYou... What are—? F-From the Magnus— Ah! Help me! \nMARTIN \nJohn, what are we doing here? \nARCHIVIST \nI don’t… I— \n(Anguished screams of agony) \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 184 – Like Ants \n14 \nJORDAN \nHelp! Please! Gahhh! \nARCHIVIST \nCeaseless Watcher, look upon this man— \n[Hissing static starts, joined with other unpleasant electronic high \ntones and glitching — similar to the ‘smite static’ from previous \nencounters with avatars] \n(Jordan continues to wail) \nMARTIN \nJohn... \nARCHIVIST \n—subsumed by terror and gripped with swarming fear. Gaze into him, through \nhim... And out of him. \n[As the static rises it morphs to sound subtlety different from \nprevious smites] \nMARTIN \nWhat does that mean? \nARCHIVIST \nMake him a vessel of your hunger, staring out and harvesting with a thousand, \nthousand, thousand, tiny, eager, eyes. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 184 – Like Ants \n15 \nMARTIN \nHang on... \nARCHIVIST \nGift him your power and protection. Make him yours. \n[The static crescendos with a melodic whooshing] \n (Jordan’s cries subside) \n[Most of the statics subside, however, faint static glitches continue] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nJordan? \nJORDAN \nWhat... What is this? \nARCHIVIST \nHow do you feel? \nJORDAN \n(Quavering) I don’t... I know you. From the Magnus Institute. What are you \ndoing here? What is this? \nMARTIN \n(Thin-lipped) Yeah, I’m curious about that myself. \nJORDAN \nWhat did you do to me? I feel... \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 184 – Like Ants \n16 \nARCHIVIST \nBetter? \nJORDAN \nSick. Like I— \n[There are pulses of sibilant electric static] \n(He gasps) \nJORDAN (CONT’D) \nWhat? What was that? \nARCHIVIST \nYou’re seeing it. Feeling it. The fear of all the others here. \nJORDAN \nAll that screaming... They’re everywhere… crawling over them, like they did \nme... It feels... \nARCHIVIST \nGood? \nJORDAN \n...Yeah. But wrong. Sick. \nWhat did you do to me? \nARCHIVIST \nI helped you. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 184 – Like Ants \n17 \n[Sounds of Jordan standing up; there are short bouts of agitated \npacing from Jordan through the rest of the conversation] \nJORDAN \nHelped me? I don’t feel right, I, I just— Ah! No I don’t— argh! I don’t want this! \n[Pulses of sibilant electric static, and the static glitches are louder \nfor a moment] \nMARTIN \nJordan? Jordan, just relax, it’ll be fine, you’ll be okay. \nJORDAN \nNo, I don’t— I didn’t ask for this! \nARCHIVIST \nYou preferred the ants? \nJORDAN \nNo! \nARCHIVIST \n(Combative) Covered and agonised? I know how scared you were, I felt it. \nJORDAN \nIt was… \nIt was a nightmare. And I couldn’t wake up. But… this is... I, I don’t \nunderstand... \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 184 – Like Ants \n18 \nARCHIVIST \nI’ll try to explain. \n(Intones) The world is over. Dark powers that feed on fear have transformed \neverything we know into a twisted hellscape, where humanity is tormented to \nfeed their hunger. We’re all trapped, but I have a certain level of ‘power’ in this \nnew world. So, I— \nJORDAN \nYou turned me into what? A torturer? \nARCHIVIST \nYes. \nJORDAN \nWhy? \nMARTIN \nGood question. John? Care to enlighten us? \nARCHIVIST \nWhat was I supposed to do? I owed you. Didn't want to just watch you suffer. \nMARTIN \nIt’s what you’ve been doing for everyone else. It’s what you’re expecting him \nto do. \nJORDAN \nI don’t… I don’t know how to be this. I don’t want to scare people. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 184 – Like Ants \n19 \nARCHIVIST \nNo. But you’ll learn. \n(Beat) \nJORDAN \nAm I still me? \nARCHIVIST \nI don’t know how to answer that. \nI can put you back if you want. You could become a victim again? Rather than \ncomplicit. \nJORDAN \n...No. This isn’t… I, I didn’t want this. But I can’t, I-I can’t go back to that. I can’t. \nARCHIVIST \nVery well. \nMARTIN \nI’m sorry. It’s… It’s a lot to take in all at once. \nJORDAN \nCan I at least… go outside? Can I leave these tunnels, the ants? Am I… free? \nARCHIVIST \nYou’re part of them now. And they’re a part of you.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 4, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 4460}}
