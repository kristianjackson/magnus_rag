Is there— Oh. \n \nBASIRA \nYeah. \n \nARCHIVIST \nFor God’s sake. \n \nBASIRA \nSo, where did it come from? \n \nARCHIVIST \nNot important right now. \n \nTIM \nTurn it off. \n \nARCHIVIST \nYes, I’m way ahead of you. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG118 – The Masquerade \n \n8 \n \n \n(Click) \n \n(Click) \n \n(Paper burns softly. There’s a click at the foor as Elias unlocks it and pushes it \nopen.) \n \nMARTIN \nHello. \n \nELIAS \nWhat are you doing? \n \nMARTIN \nThat one? That one was Benjamin Hatendi. You weren’t fast enough with the \nkey. \n \nELIAS \nWhat. Are. You. Doing? \n \nMARTIN \nOh, I’m sorry, can you not just look into my head? Read my mind? \n \n… \n \nWhat’s wrong? Too busy trying to keep an eye on everything? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG118 – The Masquerade \n \n9 \n \n \nELIAS \nTell me what you’re doing, and why. \n \nMARTIN \nI just thought I’d, you know, drop a couple of ideas in the old suggestion box. \nTurns out my suggestion is… fire. \n \n(Martin flips open zippo) \n \nELIAS \nAnd yet you haven’t set the whole Archives alight. So I assume this is, what’s \nit’s called, a cry for attention? \n \nMARTIN \nMaybe I just thought it might hurt. \n \nELIAS \nNo more than you’re hurting yourself by acting out. \n \nMARTIN \nOh, that’s it, isn’t it? Martin’s just acting out. I mean, Daisy’s a rabid dog and \nMelanie’s a potential killer. Tim’s a, a rogue element, but Martin? Well \nMartin’s just, just “acting out”. He’ll have a cry and a lie down and feel much \nbetter. \n \nELIAS \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG118 – The Masquerade \n \n10 \n \nAnd if you’re trying to convince me otherwise, then you are failing. Now, if \nyou’re quite done, I am very busy. \n \nMARTIN \nOh, sorry, sorry, I’m not keeping you from the show, am I? Well, you head \nback; I’ll keep myself busy here. Albrecht von Closen is next, I think. That’s \nquite an old one, should go up very quickly. \n \nELIAS \nDid John put you up to this? \n \nMARTIN \nYou think I’m doing this for him? \n \nELIAS \nNo? It’s just the sort of half-baked scheme he’d come up with, and I am well \naware that you’ll do just about anything for him. \n \nMARTIN \nI— \n \nELIAS \nAnd I don’t need to read your mind for that one. \n \nMARTIN \nDo you really— Is it so hard to believe that I hate you as well? \n \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG118 – The Masquerade \n \n11 \n \nELIAS \nNo, it’s just hard to imagine that you would act on it. \n \nMARTIN \nYou think I’m, what, bluffing? \n \nELIAS \nOh, no, you’ve made that quite clear. \n \nMARTIN \nSo, what, I don’t get to be angry? I don’t get to burn things, just run around \nmaking tea while everyone else gets to actually have feelings? \n \nELIAS \nPlease get to the point, Martin. \n \nMARTIN \nMaybe there isn’t one, alright? Maybe— \n \nELIAS \nMaybe you’re just wasting my time. \n \nMARTIN \nYeah. Yeah, maybe. \n \nELIAS \nI see. That puts me in a difficult position. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG118 – The Masquerade \n \n12 \n \n \nMARTIN \nGood. \n \nELIAS \nYou might want to turn the tape off, Martin. \n \n(Click) \n \n(Click) \n \nTIM \nHow much longer? \n \nDAISY \nI don’t know. \n \nTIM \nThe others didn’t take this long. \n \nDAISY \nThe others had clear structural weaknesses. This room doesn’t. \n \nTIM \nHow hard can it be to blow up one building with all this stuff? \n \nDAISY \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG118 – The Masquerade \n \n13 \n \nIt depends. Lots of other buildings close around and I was told to be careful. \n \nTIM \nRight. Fine. \n \nBASIRA \nSo, would you say this was supposed to be Churchill or Alfred Hitchcock? \n \nARCHIVIST \nJowls like that could be either. I mean, the suit is— Tim! Leave it. \n \nTIM \nWe should know what’s going on, how close they are. \n \nARCHIVIST \nWe are not ready yet. If you start opening doors and they see you... \n \nTIM \nYou’re sure it’s through there? \n \nARCHIVIST \nI, I’m pretty sure. I saw it a few times while I was here. They’ve knocked \nthrough most of the middle, hollowed it out, made a sort of auditorium. \n \nBASIRA \nHow big? \n \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG118 – The Masquerade \n \n14 \n \nARCHIVIST \nI don’t know, big. \n \nBASIRA \n I mean, it’s not a huge building. \n \nARCHIVIST \nI don’t know. Tonight was my first time seeing it from the outside, at least in \nthe, uh, flesh. I guess it does seem... smaller? \n \nBASIRA \nYou’re sure this is the right place? \n \nTIM \nI am. \n \nARCHIVIST \nThis is definitely where they kept me, although I don’t remember quite this \nmany waxworks... \n \nBASIRA \nAlright. Just don’t want to get this far just to find we’re in the … \n \n(Calliope chords start) \n \nARCHIVIST \nThis is the place.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 1, "chunk_count": 5, "chars": 4469}}
