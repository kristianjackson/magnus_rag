I still can’t believe Gertrude was allowed to let this \nplace get into such a state! \nSASHA \nMm. I just wanna know why. \nTIM \nWhat d’you mean why? You saw her, she’s like a hundred years old and more \ncardigan than woman. She just started to lose it. Sad, but it happens. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 162 – A Cosy Cabin \n24 \nSASHA \nYou never talked to her, did you? \nTIM \nWell, I mean, I must have at some point. \nSASHA \nHeh, you’d remember. \nTIM \nWhy? What was she like? \nSASHA \nStone. Cold. Bitch. \nTIM \nSasha! \nSASHA \nAnd sharper than you! No way this is accidental. \nTIM \nOh, yeah, this is all a big geriatric conspiracy. \n(Beat) \nTIM (CONT’D) \nWait, seriously? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 162 – A Cosy Cabin \n25 \nSASHA \n(Yes) Mm-hmm. \nTIM \nWhat possible reason could she have for being criminally incompetent in a \nmanky old archive? \nSASHA \nNo idea. And honestly, it kind of worries me. \nTIM \nWell, tell you what. If you get eaten alive by improperly filed statements, me \nand Martin will avenge you. \nSASHA \nWell, aren’t you sweet. \nTIM \nI mean it! We’ll burn this place to the ground; it’ll be all like (mock yelling) \nSASHA! SASHA! \nSASHA \nAnd what about John? \nTIM \n(John impression) Well, given the incoherence of this statement, I find it hard \nto believe it ever occurred. \n(Sasha laughs) \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 162 – A Cosy Cabin \n26 \nTIM (CONT’D) \nIn fact, based on the evidence, I find it highly unlikely that Sasha ever even \nexisted at all. \nSASHA \nNo. You took it too far! I’m unforgettable! \nTIM \n(Laughs) Alright. He fires you because of all the drugs and the wild orgies on \nArchive property. \nSASHA \n(Laughs) Yeah, that’s fair. Now, get back to work. \nTIM \nYes, ma’am! See? Told you you’d make a good boss. \n[Tape click] \n[The strange howls, wind and creaks resume] \n(Shakey breaths) \n[Hissing static starts] \nARCHIVIST \n(Quiet) Wha?- \n[The static rises in volume] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 162 – A Cosy Cabin \n27 \nARCHIVIST \nThere is a place, deep in the heart of fear, where you trap yourself and claim \nthat it is safety. \n[Hissing static ends] \n[As he speaks, there continues to be the sounds of strange howls, \nwind, the log fire, and wood creaks from the cabin] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nIt was once a cabin and professes still to be such, but as with all in this new \nworld that promises respite, it is a trap. \nThe land outside is warped and twisted by the touch of those things that feed \non your suffering, and behind those rough, wooden planks it seems they \ncannot reach you. The screams may linger on the distant breeze, and your Eye \nmay wander beyond the curtains from time to time, but you and the one you \nlove are, it seems, safe. If you had need to eat, no doubt there would be food; \nif you had need to sleep, no doubt the beds would be welcoming. But you have \nneed of neither, and so you sit in your meagre comfort and belief of security \nwith nothing to do, nothing to distract your mind from the agonies that lie just \nbeyond your window. And those diversions you do find will offer no relief, but \nsimply numb the mind into mournful nostalgia for a time when the world you \ninhabited seemed to make sense. \n[The howls from a creature outside seems closer for a moment] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nSomething moves outside, struggling to crawl upon a hundred reaching, \ngrasping hands.
