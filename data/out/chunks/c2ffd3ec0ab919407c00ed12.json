She \nnever seemed to feel the cold. We’d walked in silence for about an hour and it \nhad gotten dark. I was about to suggest we leave, as they usually closed the \npark after nightfall, when I heard Agnes gasp. I turned to see her gripping her \nchest as though in sudden pain, and she told me we had to go. I followed her \nas she staggered out of the park and over to a phone booth, where she made a \npanicked call. She said something about a tree falling and that they had to \nfinish something. Then she hung up. She leaned on my arm as we walked back \nto her flat. I’d never been there before, but it was clear she couldn’t make it \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG067 – Burning Desire \n \n8 \n \nunassisted. The building was old and the wallpaper of the corridor was a faded \ngreen lily pattern, occasionally scarred with a vivid hole burnt into it. \n \nAs we approached her door, I saw a small group of people gathered around it, \nwaiting. I recognised the woman she had been talking to several weeks before, \nbut the others were strangers to me. They were all dressed in rough work \nclothes and wore severe expressions. One of them, a big guy with a shaved \nhead, was holding an unlit lantern and speaking to the others in a language \nthat I think was Spanish or Portuguese. Another held a bag that seemed to be \nfull of candles, while a third had a clear plastic container filled with hundreds \nof tiny spiders. None of them paid me any attention and I was rapidly feeling \nlike I was falling into something that I really didn’t want to. \n \nAgnes turned to me and apologised. Told me goodbye and thank you. There \nwas such a sense of finality to it that I felt like my heart stopped. I should have \nleft. I should have turned around and walked back the way I’d come and \naccepted that I’d never seen her again. Instead, I did the stupidest thing I have \never done. There, caught up in a series of events that I didn’t understand, but \nthat terrified me, and drowning in emotions that I still can’t explain, I asked if I \ncould kiss her. Without warning, she put her hands either side of my head. I \nrealised it was the first time our skin had ever touched and I could feel the \nintense, hellish heat that radiated from inside her, but it was too late. She \nleaned in and kissed me. \n \nThere are no words to describe the pain. My face erupted in boiling agony as I \nfelt my skin start to crack and peel and the heat washed over me, erasing all \nthoughts in blistering white. I felt the fat in my cheeks liquify and bubble as I \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG067 – Burning Desire \n \n9 \n \ntried to scream, but my lips wouldn’t work. I fell to the floor, and the last \nmemory I have before waking up in the hospital was a single tear dropping \nonto my hand, a tiny, sizzling pang of torment that still somehow managed to \ncut through. \n \nWhen I awoke three days later in the hospital, Agnes was dead. The police \ncame and took my statement, but they had already decided it was a suicide, \nand when I tried to tell them what had happened, they looked at me like I was \nmaking it all up. At least, when they could stand to look at me at all. The \ndoctors did their best and repeatedly told me that actually I was very lucky, as \nwhatever fire I had put my face in should by rights have blinded me as well. It \nwasn’t exactly a comfort. \n \nI lost almost everything after that. I never had much to begin with, and after I \nwas let go at the cafe, I couldn’t afford to keep my home. They didn’t even try \nto pretend it wasn’t because my burned face would scare away customers. I’ve \nended up living with my father again, who has been understanding about the \nsituation, though even he can’t bring himself to meet my eye most days. The \nworst part is, looking back, I’m still not sure what I would have done \ndifferently, were I to do it all again. Even after everything the police told me \nabout her death and the hand, I don’t know if I would have had it in me to \nresist. I just couldn’t avoid being drawn in, like a moth to the flame. \n \nARCHIVIST \nStatement ends.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 4, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 4116}}
