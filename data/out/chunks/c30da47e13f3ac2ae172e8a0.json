There wasn't supposed to be \none then, she is sure of that, although, if pressed, she could not have told you \nwhat day it is today. Before the shadow fell, she is sure that the sun was \nshining brightly, although, if pressed, she could not have pictured it. And the \nhumid heat of a lingering summer had left the world sleepy and unprepared, \nalthough, if pressed, she remembers the heat but not the season. \nAll told, the time before the sky was covered is hazy to her, but she knows that \nthere was one: A time before something blocked out the Sun. \nIt moves in shifts as if it is willed, clearly a part of some greater whole. A foot? \nA hand? Perhaps a single finger. To look up is to see only the smallest fraction \nof it covering the sky, and half of Mehreen's mind screams at her to get back, \nto get further away, to get to a distance where perhaps she could see the \nwhole of it. A position where the idea of comprehending what she is looking at \nisn't some bitter joke. But the other half of her mind whispers the truth: That it \nis already so far away that to see it in its entirety is impossible. And if she did, \nshe could not understand it. \n[A distant, thunderous boom] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nBut there is another certainty within her, another piece of terrible knowledge \nthat bubbles up unbidden from somewhere in Mehreen's soul that is no longer \nhers: It is coming closer. It is descending on her home and everything that she \nhas ever known. And when it arrives, it will not even notice that it has \ndestroyed her. That it has so casually wiped from the world everything that she \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 174 – The Great Beast \n3 \nwill ever know or love. It will crush her home. It will crush her family and her \ncity and her world. The shadow is over everything. \nMehreen gathers her mother, who sits in the kitchen over a pot of sour-\nsmelling tea, berating her that they should have left earlier. She gathers her \nhusband, who snorts in derision and tells her that he's heard that there isn't \nreally any danger at all. She gathers her daughter, who asks with wide eyes and \nthe voice of nervous innocence where they are going. What's going on? \nMehreen cannot quite make out their faces as she bundles them into the car, \nold and shuddering as it coughs into life. Does she remember having a child? A \nspouse? Does she remember her mother having such a cruel sneer? It doesn't \nmatter. They are here now, and she has to save them. She cannot leave them \nto the growing shadow and the thing coming ever-closer. \n[A thunderous boom, now closer] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nShe starts to drive. The streets are empty, the blank-faced strangers around \nthem frozen, staring to the sky in still and silent expectation. There is no traffic, \nnothing to stop the laboured grinding of the elderly car as it careens down the \nstreet, hunting desperately for the edge of the shadow. Mehreen knows if she \ncan just escape it, find where it ends and the sunlight hits the earth, they can \nbe free. They will not be beneath it when the vast being arrives. \nBut there is no hope in her for it, no glimmer of optimism as they hurtle down \nstreet after street. Only the crushing dread, the leaden knowledge that they \nstarted too late, that they're not fast enough, that the shadow reaches a \nthousand miles in every direction, and they could drive for a month. Have they \nbeen driving that long? How many miles have they travelled now? And still", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 0, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 4342}}
