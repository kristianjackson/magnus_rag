In fact for the first six years of my life I \ncan only assume I existed in peaceful harmony with them. But that changed in \nthe autumn of 1991. I didn’t live in London then but with my parents in \nSouthampton, and we would visit my grandparents every Sunday, out in the \nnearby New Forest. They lived on the edge of a suburb, and from the bottom \nof my grandmother’s garden you could see fields stretching away for a half a \nmile to the tree line. I used to spend a lot of time down there, and if you were \nlucky, sometimes there would be horses.. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG016 – Arachnophobia \n9 \n \nThat day, there were no horses, just an overcast sky and wind that threatened \nto blow off my blue woollen hat. I was wandering through the scattered trees \nby the fence I wasn’t allowed to cross, and I noticed a fallen log. I had seen it \nbefore, of course, as there was little in that place that changed much between \nmy weekly visits, but there was something different about it. In one of the \nhollows sat something that I did not recognise. It was a pale brown, and looked \nsoft and lumpy, like a small sack. Knowing no better I approached it, and saw, \nperched on its top, a small spider. It watched me, warily, its fat abdomen \ntwitching, but it did not move \nIn my childish ignorance, I thought it looked silly, and I reached over for it. But I \ntripped. My hand hit the spider, killing it instantly, and plunging into the egg \nsack below, causing it to tear open and explode. I was suddenly covered in \nthousands of small, white crawling things, those tiny, dripping, half-formed and \nunfinished spiders. They covered my hands, my face… my eyes. \nI can never forget that feeling, and since then the presence of spiders has filled \nme with the deepest dread. And that was the spider that sat before me on my \nbedroom wall. Though I remembered little of what the long-dead thing had \nlooked like I knew it was the same. Can you be haunted by the ghost of a \nspider that destroyed your childhood? It sounds absurd. It sounds laughable. \nBut there it was. I didn’t know why it was here. And I didn’t know why I was \nreaching for it. My mind screamed to stop, and I let out a terrible cry, but my \nhand kept moving towards it inexorably, as though willed by something else. \nThis ghost spider felt real enough when I crushed it beneath my palm, legs \nsplayed and body bursting warmly against my skin. Once I had control of my \nlimb once again, I spent the rest of the night washing my hand. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG016 – Arachnophobia \n10 \n \nI am moving out of that building. I officially gave Major Tom’s paperwork to the \nfamily on the ground floor he decided to move in with, and will be leaving the \nmoment I find somewhere, anywhere, available for immediate rental. I can’t \nrisk seeing the thing again. I’m also seeing doctors, trying to get a referral for \npsychiatric treatment or possibly some antipsychotic medication, but I felt I \nshould probably give you a statement as well. I don’t expect you to believe me, \nbut if “ghost spiders” falls under anyone’s remit, I suppose it’s yours. \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nStatement ends. \nI think the most important lines in this statement come at the very end. \nAntipsychotic medication and disbelief are, I think, exactly what Mr. Vittery \nneeded to get through his problem with, er, “ghost spiders”. There simply \naren’t enough details given in this statement to actually investigate, short of \nMartin confirming that Mr. Vittery did indeed live at the addresses he \nprovided. \nI would have asked Tim to follow up with Mr. Vittery himself, but he appears to \nhave passed away shortly after giving his statement. He was found in his \nBoothby Road residence, after neighbours complained of the smell, and had \napparently been dead for over a week. Coroner’s report lists asphyxiation as \nthe cause of death, probably due to choking, though it doesn’t say what he \nchoked on, simply lists “foreign organic material” blocking his throat. \nIf I were of a more alarmist nature I might think the appearance of Mr. \nVittery’s corpse lent some credibility to his tale. But as I told Martin earlier, he", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 5, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 4297}}
