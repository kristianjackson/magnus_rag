At the time, I don’t think I felt anything except annoyance that I \nwas going to be two minutes late to the viewing. You know what’s funny? Even \nafter everything that happened, I actually have trouble picturing the house in \nmy mind. It was so much like all the others. So unremarkable. And it’s not like \nI’ve been back. \nFor most of the morning views it was business as usual. I had the usual stream \nof bankers and executives asking the standard questions, occasionally livened \nup by a private dentist or a barrister. I walked around that house for the better \npart of five hours, and by the end I’d been in every room and opened every \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG047 – The New Door \n5 \n \ncupboard dozens of times. And I promise you, I swear to you, that door was \nnot there. \nHe came at the end of the viewings. It was the last appointment and, although \nhe didn’t give his name, I am absolutely sure he was not Mr and Mrs Adrian \nLombardi. He was tall, maybe six and a half feet? And he had long, straw-\ncoloured hair that fell onto his shoulders in loose ringlets. His face was round \nand unthreatening, although he stood so still when I answered the door that it \nrather unnerved me. \nI asked him if he was Mr Lombardi and he said no, but that Mr Lombardi \nwouldn’t be coming, so he was here instead. It’s not unheard of for some of \nour clients to send their people to viewings in their place, so it didn’t seem like \nan unreasonable statement, even if it would normally, you know, be arranged \nahead of time. I just... I just thought I’d missed an email. \nI held out my arm for a handshake, but he just looked at it and laughed, \nkeeping his hands firmly by his side. That was when I first started to think that \nsomething might be wrong, because his laugh didn’t sound right? It... I don’t \nknow how to describe it, but it wasn’t... it wasn’t a human laugh. I should have \nstopped there and left, or called the police, but he’d already walked past me \nand into the house and I’d started to give him the sales pitch, almost as a \nreflex. \nI decided that, since he didn’t seem to be actively threatening, I’d just give him \na quick run-down of the house and get out of there as soon as possible. He was \nstrange, but I thought that if he did work for the Lombardis that I didn’t want \nto be rude and have to deal with a complaint later. So I took him round the \nplace. He followed me, his... his eyes were also looking where I pointed, but he \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG047 – The New Door \n6 \n \nnever seemed to take anything in, and he didn’t ask any questions at all. At \nleast not until we reached the second floor. \nWe’d just climbed up the stairs to the top of the house. I went into the first \nbedroom and I started talking about its potential as a child’s room or a study. \nThe ceiling was quite low and I thought I’d best warn him to be careful, but \nwhen I looked back he wasn’t there. I stepped back out onto the landing to \nfind him looking at a new door. He asked me what was behind it and I just \nstood there, staring. It was a small, unremarkable door, painted dark yellow \nwith a matte black handle and it wasn’t there before. \nI had been up on that landing dozens of times already and I definitely did not \nremember it being there. It, it wasn’t just that I hadn’t noticed it – you have to \nunderstand that. It wasn’t there. It couldn’t have been there. I checked the \nfloor plan I had with me and obviously there was no door shown on it. It was \nan exterior wall on the second floor. There can’t have been anything beyond it \nbut empty air and a significant drop. Except that I had made several circuits of \nthe outside while showing off the garden and there was absolutely no door \nvisible there. It was just a dark yellow door that couldn’t be there. The man \nasked me again what was inside and I just stood there staring at it with my \nmouth hanging open in shock. \nI honestly don’t know how long I stood there looking at it. My strange client \nsaid nothing and I’d almost forgotten he was there by the time I finally made \nup my mind. I reached out and gripped the handle. It was warm. I turned it and \nas soon as I did so, the door swung open. I didn’t need to pull it at all. It \nopened slowly, but deliberately, like it was keen for me to go inside. And \nbeyond that threshold, where there should have been empty air over the \ngarden, there was a long windowless corridor.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 1, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 4463}}
