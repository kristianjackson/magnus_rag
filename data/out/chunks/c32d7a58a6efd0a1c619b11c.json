You’re riding with me. \n \nARCHIVIST \nI don’t think so. \n \nJULIA \nThen try to run. Go on. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG107 – Third Degree \n \n14 \n \n \nARCHIVIST \nSo... Kidnapped. Again. \n \nJULIA \nThink of it like an... escort. Personal bodyguard. You’re heading to DC, right? \nCome on. We can chat in the car. I’m sure you’ve got a ton of librarian stories – \nthe miles’ll just fly past. \n \nARCHIVIST \nDo I have any choice? \n \nJULIA \nIf you did, you’d only make a mistake. Come on. \n \n(Click) \n \n(Click) \n \n(Rumble of engines, driving down the interstate) \n \nARCHIVIST \nAre you alright? You seem, uh... \n \nJULIA \nSure, just keeping an eye out.

Checked myself in there a while back. Ended up spilling my guts to \nthis old woman all about my dad. Just... letting it all out. \n \nARCHIVIST \nThat would be Gertrude, my predecessor. \n \nJULIA \nDidn’t catch her name. Weirdest thing, really. Didn’t mean to spill half of it, \nbut... really helped me put the pieces together, you know? \n \nARCHIVIST \nI’m starting to. \n \nJULIA \nYou still haven’t told me what you’re doing this side of the pond. Or why you’re \nasking around about Gerard Keay? \n \nARCHIVIST \nWould you believe me if I said I was trying to save the world. \n \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG107 – Third Degree \n \n16 \n \nJULIA \nProbably not. \n \n(Pause) \n \nARCHIVIST \nWhat about you? \n \n… \n \nWhat brings the daughter of Robert Montauk all the way out here? And why \nexactly are you— \n \n(American police siren calls from behind them. The Archivist exhales. The car \nindicates and slows to a stop.
