It was just me and Lana. And \nshe was making the final checks to lock up. I ran to the changing rooms and \ngrabbed the small bag from my locker that contained my pencils, inks and \npaper, and then hurried back and over to the womenswear department. I \ncouldn’t hear Lana anywhere, which is strange as she usually provided \nsomething of a running commentary, but I didn’t really notice. \nThen I rounded the corner of one of the aisles and stopped dead: the \nmannequin was gone. The pedestal where the ‘Nights at the Circus’ display had \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG083 – Drawing a Blank \n11 \n \nstood was empty, save for a torn pile of paper maché and the headless figure \nof a plastic acrobat. \nI stood there, my mouth hanging open, as I tried to figure out what was going \non. Had Lana done this? Was this all some elaborate ploy to frame me for… \nsomething, vandalism? That didn’t make any sense. The store around me was \nstill and silent, and it felt as if all I could do was wait for something to happen. \nAnd sure enough, after a minute or two, I heard Lana’s voice calling to me. \nExcept it didn’t sound quite right. There was a strangled, hoarse quality to it, \nlike the words were being pushed out against her will. I was terrified of what I \nwould see when I reached her, but my only other option was to run, and if she \nwas in trouble, I’d never forgive myself. I pulled out my phone and pressed \n999, my thumb hovering over the call button as I approached the storeroom \nwhere Lana’s voice was coming from. The door’s small window was too high, \nso I just had to push it open. It was so heavy against my shaking hands. \nThe room was dark on the other side. I reached up to turn on the lights, but \nthe switch flipped uselessly back and forth. The light from the door illuminated \na few boxes of leggings, but I couldn’t bring myself to go any further in. Just \nbeyond the light from the door I could see a figure, tall and thin. It could have \nbeen Lana, but I wasn’t sure. \nAt least until it began to move. Its steps were jerky and stiff, arms snapping out \nand back as it moved towards me step by step. I felt my own limbs seize up at \nthe sight, and my phone slipped uselessly from my hand. The faceless figure \nloomed over me, and when it bent down, the finger it placed upon my lips was \ncold, hard plastic. \n“Shhhhh…” it said. Though it had no mouth to form the sound. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG083 – Drawing a Blank \n12 \n \nThe next thing I remember is the police. I must have pressed dial before I \ndropped my phone. They found what was left of Lana further into the \nstoreroom. I was questioned for a while, but much to the dismay of tabloid \nheadlines everywhere, it became clear quite quickly that there was no way I \ncould have done it. The CCTV showed me almost constantly during the period \nLana would have been killed, and the only blood on me was a single, neat line \nacross my lip. \nOf course, that’s not to say the police believed my version of events either. \nThey are currently working on the theory that a killer had been stalking the \nstore for a while, and finally chose that night to strike, but they didn’t expect \nme to still be there, and fled when it was clear I’d called the police. But I know. \nI remember. Sometimes I wake up in the night, and I can taste the blood and \nplastic of that stiff and lifeless hand. \nStatement ends. \nARCHIVIST \nAs I have discovered in the few days since this statement arrived, it is far \nharder to conduct a thorough investigation without the resources of the \nInstitute or the… expertise of my assistants. I have located a few stories about \nthe death of Lana Billings, found… strangled and partially skinned in the \nstorage of Fanton’s department store, but the rather lurid newspaper coverage \nis as much as I could find, and it gives no further information of use. \nWell, that’s not quite true. The Express illustrates their story with a picture of \nthe service entrance to Fanton’s, the entrance the killer is assumed to have \nused to access the storeroom. I do not know whether this picture was taken \nbefore or after the crime, or whether it’s a stock photo, but I cannot help but", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 4, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 4351}}
