The important aspect to bear in \nmind is to never allow the lily to forget its physical existence. Temperatures \ncan be hot or cold as long as it is uncomfortable, and light levels need only be \nhigh if the preoccupation with its body's presence has a visual component. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 171 – The Gardener \n14 \nMost importantly, the absence of any transcendence or death should always \nbe emphasized when watering or pruning. Spirituality, afterlife, \ntranshumanism, religion; all must be roundly dismissed or mocked, at all times \nwith the clear conclusion that the meat from which the lily blooms is the only \nform of being it will ever enjoy. \nThe flowers that spring from a Lily of the Damned are less predictable than \nthose of other denizens of the mortal garden, being haphazard black growths \nof calcified fluid and sinuous, dangling nerves. They can grow very fast, but are \nin no danger of dominating any arrangement, as they will by nature attempt to \nretreat beneath the soil, hiding the painful existence that horrifies them so \nfrom any who might be watching, including themselves. Periodically, if you \nwish to display and grow your lily to its best advantage, you must seize \nwhatever part of it remains above ground and pull, bringing it up into the open \nair. Use as much force as you have available without worry of dislodging it \nentirely. The lily's roots go deep, and can withstand almost any attempt to \ndislodge them. \nThis is Maeve's nightmare. There is no other word for it. To be trapped, \nunmoving, within the body that has betrayed her so often, feeling every \nsensation as it grows and warps and sprouts, never knowing what new \nmutation it will visit on her next. She is unable to even hide. There is no \npromise of the peaceful sleep of the innocent dead, not the dream of a digital \nescape from the hell her body has become. She is here, and she is trapped in \nthe same soft prison of skin she has always so despised. \nWhile it will never be a focus piece for a mortal garden, the Lily of the Damned \nis a popular choice among experimental gardeners, as its almost indestructible \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 171 – The Gardener \n15 \nnature allows them the opportunity to exercise a great deal of creativity in its \ncultivation. \nThe mortal garden grows and twists and screams and bleeds. It is loved by the \nhands that tend it, but that love sows only misery and fear. It is the worst place \nthat has ever been beautiful— \n[Hissing static starts] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \n— and it should not exist. \n(Jared takes a deep growly breath) \n[The sounds of the garden, flesh and bone noises continue, with \nsome whimpering and groan of victims] \n[Hissing static ends] \nJARED \nCheers for that. \nARCHIVIST \nDon't. \nMARTIN \nJohn are you, alright? \nARCHIVIST \nYeah. Um, uh, sorry. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 171 – The Gardener \n16 \nMARTIN \nNo— it’s-it’s alright. \nJARED \nIs it really that bad? Seeing what I've done here? Or, heh, is it maybe that deep \ndown, you think it's as beautiful as I do? \nARCHIVIST \nShut up! \nJARED \nIt's a shame. Who's gonna look after the garden when I'm gone? There are a \nfew real pretty ones. \nWho knows. Maybe they'll uproot and start landscaping themselves. That'd be \nnice. Then again, maybe it'll just grow wild. \nARCHIVIST \nI don't. Care. \nJARED \nNo. You don't, do you? \nARCHIVIST \nI can't. There's too many. I can't save everyone. Huh, I c— I can't save anyone. \nJARED \nIf you say so.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 4, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 3880}}
