She was the \nstrangest person I had ever met, but something about it just charmed me. So \nwe went down to Bolehill Park, the nearest one to my flat, and we walked. I \ndid most of the talking, as you might have expected. I don’t even remember \nhalf the things I said now, just a meaningless babble of thoughts, personal \ndetails and anecdotes. I worried I was boring her, but every time I looked over, \nshe had that same expression on, which by then I was pretty sure was a smile. \nI’d catch her eye and that feeling would flood through me. I still don’t know \nquite how to describe it, but whatever it was, it was powerful. \n \nWe sat on a bench as the sun went down, watching the sky redden, and Agnes \nasked me a question. It was the first time she’d said anything more than a few \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG067 – Burning Desire \n \n7 \n \nwords since we left my flat. She asked me if I had a destiny. I don’t need to tell \nyou the question caught me off guard. I don’t know if I’ve given the impression \nclearly enough yet, being a single guy in my early 30s still working the till at a \nSheffield cafe, but I don’t really see myself as having much of a destiny. Hell, \nI’m not even sure I believe in destiny. I certainly don’t believe in God and I feel \nthat’s kind of linked. So I told her this. She looked at me with the same sadness \nI’d seen on her face before. “That must be nice,” she said, and went back to \nstaring into the sunset. \n \nWe went out several times after that. Each time she’d show up AT my door \nunannounced and tell me what we were going to do. We went to the park a \ncouple more times, had a meal in an Italian restaurant, where she didn’t eat \nanything, and even went to see a film. I remember it was The Prestige and, \nwhen I asked her thoughts on it, she just told me she hadn’t been watching. \nGod, she was so bizarre. \n \nThe last date was November the 23rd, 2006. It was a Thursday and the chill \nhad really hit. It was too cold to spend an evening in the park, to be honest, \nbut Agnes had decided that’s what we had to do, so that’s what we did. She \nnever seemed to feel the cold. We’d walked in silence for about an hour and it \nhad gotten dark. I was about to suggest we leave, as they usually closed the \npark after nightfall, when I heard Agnes gasp. I turned to see her gripping her \nchest as though in sudden pain, and she told me we had to go. I followed her \nas she staggered out of the park and over to a phone booth, where she made a \npanicked call. She said something about a tree falling and that they had to \nfinish something. Then she hung up. She leaned on my arm as we walked back \nto her flat. I’d never been there before, but it was clear she couldn’t make it", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 3, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 2721}}
