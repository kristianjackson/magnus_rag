He's, I, I don't know. I like him. He doesn't \nlike me, though. Not really. I don't blame him. I don't like me sometimes, and I \nam me. Plus he's, he's my, my boss? Is that right? \nE, ei-either way, it's probably for the best. (adorkable) Wouldn't really be \nappropriate. You don't need to worry, I'm not doodling his name on my desk or \nanything, heh, his uh, his, his, um. His... name.... \nWait. \n[Chair squeaks] \nMARTIN (CONT'D) \nWait, what is his name? (distressed) I don't, wait, wh-wh-why can't I \nremember his name? His, his face, I don't… \n[Martin gets up from the chair; his unsure footsteps on the \nfloorboards echo; he heads towards the shore sounds] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 170 – Recollection \n5 \nMARTIN (CONT'D) \nWh-where am I? This, this isn't my house! H-hello? I-I don't like it here. I can't \nsee anything with all this— \n[He pushes back a curtain] \nMARTIN (CONT'D) \n—fog, there’s, there’s nothing out of the windows, and it's, it's so cold. \n[Footsteps head away from the window and shore sounds] \nMARTIN (CONT'D) \nThe fireplace is dead and the curtains... there are mirrors but no... No. Not \nmirrors. Someone's standing in them but I don't — \n[He takes a step closer] \nMARTIN (CONT'D) \nI-I don't know who. That face, who is, who is that? \n(Quietly) I need to sit down. \n[He walks back to the chair; it creaks as he sits] \n[Hissing static starts] \n[Hissing static ends] \nMARTIN (CONT'D) \n(Pleasant) Oh! Oh, hello. (small laugh) Who are you, then? Hmm. Hm. \nCan't quite make out a, a tape recorder? \n[Tape recorder handling] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 170 – Recollection \n6 \nMARTIN (CONT’D) \nHah, can't remember the last time I used a… \n[Chair creaks] \nMARTIN (CONT'D) \nHm. Blast from the past! Familiar... Well, it's good to have someone to talk to. \nOtherwise you can go strange, you... I, I don't... Hm. What was I saying? This... \nthis chair— \n[Chair scraping back] \nMARTIN (CONT'D) \n—really isn't comfortable. I had a look round for better places to sit, did I tell \nyou that? But it's, it's big house. My house, I think, heh, nowhere comfortable. \nSo I suppose this is it. It is my house, isn't it? Must be. Must be. But I don't \nreally remember. Just... so tired. It's hard to think when you're this tired, hard \nto... to focus. No, no, no, not, not, not tiredness, it’s the, fog. I, I can't see \nthrough the fog, and it, it smells! \n(Sniffs) What— (sniffs) what is that? Damp, sort of, chemical, almost. (large \nsniff) I don't like it. Why does my house smell like that, It, it can't be my house. \nNo, no, no; my, (sniff) my, (sniff) my house doesn't smell like this! My house \nsmells... s-smells different. \nIt's sort of weird, isn't it? Smell can trigger memory so... powerfully. Like this \none, it, it makes me think of, (long sniff) Hm. (sniff) Hm. I, I don't know. Is it a \nperson? A place? No, no; people-people don't smell like that. Besides, I'm all \nalone. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 170 – Recollection \n7 \nI'm all— \n[Chair creaks] \nMARTIN (CONT'D) \n(Distressed) I'm all alone. Why-why am I alone? I shouldn’t, I shouldn't be \nalone; there should be people! It's such a, such a big house, my house, there \nmu—there must be other people? People who care! \nUnless… \n[Martin gets up and walks slowly and unsurely] \nMARTIN (CONT'D) \nHello? \n[A door creaks open, as he walks into another room; a ticking clock \nis here, with the same tick-tock sound as the one in the first room] \nMARTIN (CONT'D) \nHe- Hello? \n[He keeps walking] \nMARTIN (CONT'D) \nAll these rooms.... I think they're the same as this one. I, I don't know why I'd \ndecorate my house like this; I don't like it, I like… \nWh, i-it's not my home; it can't be. Do I have a home? This-this place feels like \nit's all for me, I think, but I don't… \n[He sits in a chair that sounds identical to the previous one]", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 1, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 3844}}
