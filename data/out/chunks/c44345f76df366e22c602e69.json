We’ll meet again. Hopefully when you’re feeling a little \nbit more… open-minded. \nMARTIN \nI wouldn’t count on it. \nANNABELLE \nI would. \n(Martin exasperated sigh) \nARCHIVIST \n(Vague) That’s the trouble with old houses, I suppose. Full of spiders. \nANNABELLE \nYou boys better take care of yourselves. I’m sure we’ll see each other again \nvery soon. Here, why don’t I show you out. \nARCHIVIST \nFine. \n[Footsteps proceed through the hallways and doors of the country \nhouse] \n[A door creaks open, followed by faint sounds of opera] \nMIKAELE \nAh, you are off, then? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 181 – Ignorance \n26 \nARCHIVIST \nYes, uh... \nMARTIN \nThank you, for all your hospitality. \nMIKAELE \nYou are sure you won’t stay a little longer? You’re more than welcome. \nARCHIVIST \nNo. I... uh... I got to, um, leave. \nMARTIN \nWhat he said. \nMIKAELE \nAh, such a shame. And you’re sure I can’t give you a little something for the \nroad? Food? Wine? \nMARTIN \nAh, no, thank you. Ah, (sighs) nice things they… tend not to stay nice out there. \nMIKAELE \nHuh, true enough. Well, best of luck I suppose. And if in the end, you can’t save \nthe world... you know where I am. \nANNABELLE \n(Smiling) Actually, he doesn’t. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 181 – Ignorance \n27 \n(Mikaela chuckles) \nMIKAELE \nAh, of course. What a shame. Well, then I guess it really is goodbye. Travel \nwell. Don’t be Strangers! \n(Mikaela chuckles, lower and more dark) \nMARTIN \nHah… Yeah, ah, come on, John. Let’s go. \nARCHIVIST \nMm? What? Oh, yes, r-right. Yes. \n[Footsteps walk off] \n[Tape clicks off] \n[Tape clicks on] \n[A wasteland wind swirls with the sound of distant distorted howls] \nMARTIN \nFeeling better? \nARCHIVIST \nUm... yeah. I’m afraid I am. \nMARTIN \nAlright. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 181 – Ignorance \n28 \nARCHIVIST \nI’m sorry. It would have been nice to stay. \nMARTIN \n(Wistfully) Yeah. \nI’d almost forgotten what it was like, you know? A bit of peace. \nARCHIVIST \nI mean, you could have— \nMARTIN \nNo, don’t say it, John. You know I never would. I c-can’t just forget about all \nthe people out here. Besides, I’d rather be trapped in a post-apocalyptic \nwasteland with you than spend one more moment in paradise with her. \nARCHIVIST \n(Chuckling) That might just be the nicest thing you’ve ever said to me. \nMARTIN \nYeah, yeah. Come on. We’ve got a job to do. \nARCHIVIST \nI suppose we do. \n[Footsteps head off across soft gritty ground] \n[Quiet hissing static starts] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 181 – Ignorance \n29 \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nAh. Pity. \nMARTIN \nWhat? \nARCHIVIST \nIt’s, ah... it’s going away. That peace, the-the safety, the memory of \nignorance... \n[Quiet hissing static ends] \nMARTIN \nThat’s... Yeah, I guess that makes sense. Do you remember any of it? W-What \nSalesa said? Annabelle? \nARCHIVIST \nSome, I think. It’s, uh... Do you mind filling me in? \nMARTIN \nWait, you need me to tell you something for once? \nARCHIVIST \nI guess so. It’s, ah... It’s gone. Like a dream. \nWhat was it like? \n(Beat)", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 6, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 3120}}
