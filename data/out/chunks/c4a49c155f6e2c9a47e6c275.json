And the worst part was that somewhere in \nme I… I liked it. Underneath all that awful fear, it felt like home. \nAfter that happened, they wouldn’t leave me alone. I could see them \nspreading, see them growing. Even when I went to your institute, tried to warn \nher, I could see them crawling through the corridors towards the Archives. \nThey never got quite as big as they were in my dreams, but it wasn’t long \nbefore I was seeing them all the time. I tried to avoid them, of course I did, but \nsometimes I didn’t notice and I would brush against them. Never mattered \nwhat I was wearing; the cold would just cut through it like a razor. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 121 – Far Away \n \n5 \n \nI wanted to escape. I needed to. I became obsessed with trying to find \nsomewhere with fewer and fewer people. Moving out of the city helped, but \nwell, people still die in the countryside. I saw them coiling around a fencepost \nby the road; climbing up the wall and into the top window of a beautiful little \ncottage. I’ll never forget seeing a field of cows the week before they were sent \nto the abattoir. I’d spend hours researching, desperately looking at remote \nlocations, places far away from ‘civilisation’ and all its dying people. Lonely \nsummits, deep jungles, deserts where even animals couldn’t live. I was so \nhungry for the peace that I thought these places could give me. \nThen I read about Point Nemo. If you look it up online, they call it the “oceanic \npoint of inaccessibility”. It’s a spot in the middle of the South Pacific Ocean. \nSpecifically, it is the furthest it’s possible to be from any landmass, fourteen \nhundred miles from anyone or anything. No ships ever need to travel through \nit, and ocean currents keep away the nutrients that would normally support \nsea life. It is the emptiest, most lifeless place on earth. Sometimes the closest \nhumans are in the satellites orbiting up above it, before they fall out of the sky, \nof course. It turns out Point Nemo is an ideal site for spacecraft to crash land. \nThere must be hundreds of wrecks down there, taken from the edge of one \nlifeless abyss and sent screaming down into another. \nI loved it, the idea of it, of being so far from anything. Somewhere that there \nwas so little life that death could never find me. Empty, clear water, free of \nthose creeping tendrils. Of course, I had no way to get there. I’m not a rich \nman, and even if I was it’s not like I have any idea how to organise a sea \nvoyage. So for years it was just my little fantasy, my escape. Whenever it all got \ntoo much for me, and I woke up to those veins reaching along the wall towards \nmy neighbour’s apartment, I would go online and look at the photos people", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 2, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 2766}}
