It sounded too much like it wanted to get in. \nThe thunder woke me: another long, deep roar that seemed to come as much \nfrom the ground as it did the clouds. The rain still hammered down outside and \nI checked my watch, staring at it in confusion. It didn’t make any sense. It said \nit was three AM, the middle of the night, but looking out through the window, \nthe world was still light. The sky was cloudy and grey, as it had been the \nprevious day, and the rain made it impossible to see further than the end of \nthe street. But all the same, it definitely wasn’t night. There were no \nstreetlights turned on and, now that I looked for it, I couldn’t see any windows \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 129 – Submerged \n12 \n \nlit in any of the other houses on the street. It seemed like it was just me. Me \nand the steady, driving rain. \nThe road was beginning to properly flood now, with an inch or two of water \ncreeping up over the edges and starting to cover the pavement and climbing \nup the tires of the parked cars. I started to consider trying to leave. Perhaps I \nhad missed some sort of official evacuation, some huge storm warning, and I \nwas in terrible danger. No, that was ridiculous – this wasn’t some rural town \npanicking at the prospect of a flash flood. This was East London. If there was \nsome sort of disaster coming, I would have seen something: an emergency \nvehicle, or at least someone in a high vis vest. I was overreacting; it was just \nthe rain, keeping everybody home. They all just wanted to stay dry. I lied to \nmyself like that until the water was too high for me to even consider going \noutside in it, and I was trapped. \nBy the time it started to pour into the downstairs of the house, I had just about \naccepted that, whatever was going on, there was no longer a day or a night, \njust the storm and the rain and the thunder. It’s odd how you gradually come \nto accept things as real. By the time you drop the last of your rationalisations, \nthere’s no surprise left in you, just an awareness that, no matter how wrong it \nmight feel, it is the reality you are now in. I walked down the stairs, as low as I \ncould without stepping into the water, and I watched it. It was dark and murky, \nobscuring anything below its surface as soon as it was covered. I reached my \nhand out and pushed it gently into the flood. It was warm, as warm as my \nhand, and moments after the water covered it, my mind could no longer easily \ntell where my skin ended and the water began. It should only have been half a \nfoot deep at most but, reaching in, I couldn’t feel the floor. I pulled my hand \nout and returned upstairs. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 129 – Submerged \n13 \n \nBy the time the rain stopped, it was halfway up the staircase and had almost \ncompletely submerged the cars parked outside. The thrumming of the rain \ngave way to sudden silence, and for a moment, I allowed myself the smallest \nsliver of hope. The streets outside were still, the top of the floodwaters flat and \nundisturbed. The sky remained those same dingy cloud, but it seemed to be \nholding its breath. Then, one by one, the headlights on the cars lit up. They \nshone out into the water that covered them, faintly illuminating the murky \nliquid for a few feet below the surface. And that’s when I finally saw things \nmoving. Silhouettes, gliding through the water with smooth, undulating \nmotions. They might have been the shape of people; it was hard to tell for \nsure. They moved too fast, darting in and out of the lights before my eyes \ncould fully register what they were seeing. \nI left the window and returned to the mattress. I was tired, I was hungry, and \nwithout the motion of the rain, the air had become intolerably humid. Every \nbreath I took filled my lungs with that thick, wet scent and it felt like I could \nbarely get enough oxygen to think. The walls of my house were slick with \nmoisture now, and there was nowhere I could go to be dry, no way out of this \noppressive, cloying damp. \nThen the thunder came for the last time. It shook and rattled with more force \nthan it ever had before, and the empty oak wardrobe fell over with a crash. I \nran to the window and saw that the floodwaters were rising again, but faster \nthis time and not because of any rain. The house, the street, the world, was \nsinking into that unending line of water which I was now certain stretched out \nto the horizon. Inch by inch, foot by foot, everything was descending into the \nwater’s", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 4, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 4499}}
