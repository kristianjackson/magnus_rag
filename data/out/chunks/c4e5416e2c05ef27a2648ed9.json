You turn to walk away, \nto hurry back and disappear into the tombs that now seem almost welcoming, \nwhen behind you comes the inescapable, the inevitable sound of an old \nwooden door being opened. \n[Door creaks open] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \n‘Come in,’ the Funeral Director intones, ‘the service is about to begin. You are \nexpected.’ \nThe faceless gaze of each sepulchre angel fixes itself upon you, and you feel \nyourself turning back towards the house, though every muscle in your body \nscreams at you to run. Instead you nod, and apologise for your lateness. The \nangels look away. And you step across the threshold. \n[The crowd fades, replaced by the sound of close, upset breathing] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 180 – Moving On \n14 \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nThe air smells of decay and lavender and something else you can’t quite place. \nThe dust has settled over everything in layers so thick you dread to touch \nanything, to rest for even a moment, so keenly aware of the stark imprint you \nwould leave, the marks of your presence, so deep and clear. A sign of life \namongst the judgemental dead. \nThe Funeral Director does not comment upon your reluctance or care, though \nyou know that nothing escapes his eyes. \n[Breathing continues, footsteps on carpet] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nHe leads you through the winding house towards the memorial room, the thick \ncarpet crunching under your feet so loudly that it makes you wince, certain \nthat it calls all attention to you. The Director’s steps are silent and dignified, \nthe heavy fabric of his dark suit still and crisp as cold iron. \n[Footsteps transition to a wooden floor and stop] \n[The sound of many quietly waiting people, with hushed whispers] \nThe mourners are all lined up so very, very neatly, four chairs either side, \ntwenty rows deep. Each and every one in pitch-black funeral best, grey-haired \nheads bowed in respect, and a steady river of restrained tears flowing \ngracefully from under lace veils. There is no ragged breathing, no agonised \nwails of deep and wounding grief, only the respectful stillness of those who \nhave lost a great figure, the best of them. \nAt the end of the room is the coffin, polished to a dreadful shine. There is no \npicture, no photograph of a smiling face casting beatitudes from beyond the \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 180 – Moving On \n15 \ngrave. But the coffin is open, and from inside you can see the faintest hint of its \noccupant. \nNo. It can’t be her. That’s not right. It’s not fair. \n[Everyone turns in their seat; footsteps on the wooden floor] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nOne hundred and sixty pairs of misty eyes follow your slow procession down \nthe room, bile rising higher and higher with each row you pass. Fifteen left, you \ncan make out her hair, still the cold grey you remember so vividly. Ten rows \nleft, and you can see her mouth, those lips that hide the grin that now flashes \nthorough your memory. Five more, and you can see her eyes. Why are her \neyes open? They are lustreless and clouded, but still contain the cruelty you \nsaw when she held the knife. \n[Walking stops] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nNow you stand over her. There is no mistaking who it is that lies within that \nsoftly padded box. Beneath your threadbare suit and fear-stained shirt, the \nscars that lattice across your body ache and burn at the sight of the one who \ngave them to you. You feel the cross she once carved into your back open, and \nbegin to weep its own bloody testament. \nYou need to leave, to turn and flee and find the end to this necropolis of polite \ndenials and vicious civility. Your vision swims as you turn from the face of \ndeath, and find your arm grasped by the Funeral Director. His hand moves and \nyou move with it, unable to stand against the unyielding strength of his \nsimplest gesture.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 3, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 3802}}
