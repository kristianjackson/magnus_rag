The soldier had never before encountered an honest game. \nHe had before him a small pile of ivory sticks, not unlike those used for betting \nin mah-jongg, though the soldier had no knowledge of such a game. He knew \nthat if his pile was gone, then his life was forfeit. \nThe game was slow and deliberate, and the soldier could not have said if they \nplayed for hours, for days or for months. The night outside showed no sign of \nending, nor did the rain cease its drumming out a rhythm on the still open \ncellar door. The cards were placed slowly and deliberately by Death, and the \nsoldier became more and more amazed with the revelation that this was least \ncrooked game of faro he had ever played. Still, there was little scope to cheat, \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG029 – Cheating Death \n7 \n \nas there was none of the shouting or crowds that served as a distraction in \nevery gambling parlour. The relentless hollow gaze of the collapsing holes of \nDeath's skull were enough to keep the soldier almost from pushing his luck too \nfar. \nThen at last it reached what looked to be the final play. The deck was almost \nexhausted, and all the soldier had was piled upon the number three. As his \nreserve had dwindled, the soldier felt the wound in his chest begin to pulse \nwith a dull ache, as thick beads of sweat rolled down his shivering face. If the \nfinal three came up for the dealer, he had lost, but if it came up for him, then \nhe would finish the game with a higher stack than Death. Perhaps that would \nbe enough for him to win? The rules of the wager had not been clearly \nexplained, but as the shivering began to overtake him, the soldier clutched to \nthis faint hope. And as Death reached its hand for the final cards, he placed his \ncopper upon his pile, the six-sided token that reversed the bet. Now it was, if \nDeath drew the three as the dealer's card, he would win. \nDeath turned the card to reveal… a King, and reached for the next one. The \nsoldier knew that he had made a mistake. When the three was turned, his \nwould lose his bet and lose everything. He had only one chance, one thin sliver \nof hope, and even that would no doubt simply damn him further. But what else \ncould he do? As Death turned its head towards the faro box to draw the next \ncard, the soldier, in one practiced move, took the thin length of twine wrapped \naround his thumb and through the tiny, drilled hole in his copper, and pulled it \ntaut. With an almost imperceptible flick of the wrist he pulled it back and into \nhis hand, removing it from the board and leaving his bet to win when the three \nwas drawn. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG029 – Cheating Death \n8 \n \nThe terror that gripped him when Death returned its gaze to the board was \ndeeper than any he had ever known. Every other time he had attempted that \ntrick, the baying of the crowd and the heaving mass of patrons placing bets \nafforded him ample cover, yet in the stillness and dark, with just him and his \nendless opponent playing their game, there was surely no way such a move \ncould go unnoticed. Death turned the card over: the Three of Spades. \n“You win.” Its tone was almost… happy. The soldier didn’t notice, as at these \nwords a thrill went through his heart. He had beaten Death. He was going to \nlive. He stood up, still giddy and feverish, but with such joy that he nigh on \ncollapsed from the laughter that exploded from his lips. He staggered to the \ncellar door, expecting to see the sunrise after so long waiting in the dark, but \nthe sky was still black. Behind him, Death waited. \nThe soldier noticed the pain in his chest was gone, and took in a lungful of air. \nIt was cold, damp, and tinged with a faint whiff of something metallic. It was \nonly then he really noticed the low, rumbling laugh that came from Death. He \nturned to see the figure still sat at the table, but now the old monk’s robes \nwere soaked with blood. The bones of the figure were red and dripping, with \npatches of muscle appearing over them. \nThen he felt it in himself. Something was very wrong. An itching, burning deep \nwithin him, then a flash of intense pain in his arm. He grabbed it instinctively, \nbut where he touched it, the skin and flesh beneath it came away in his hand, \nlike chunks of wet bread. Beneath it, he could see the yellow-white of bone. \nHis bone. Old bone. And the soldier began to scream. \nAs more of his body sloughed off of him into cr", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 3, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 4500}}
