Statement of Karolina Górka, regarding a brief period trapped on \nthe London Underground. Statement taken direct from subject 25th January \n2017. \nKAROLINA \n\nThank you. On the night of the 6th of January 2017 I left the Star of Kings and \nwalked down to the tube station at King’s Cross St Pancras. For reasons I’m not \ninterested in discussing here, I have for some years now maintained a tradition \nof celebrating a personal New Year’s Eve with a handful of close friends, a \nweek or so after the actual event. The last two of these celebrations have \ntaken place at the Star, a pub which I have grown fond of for its choice of beer \nand the open fireplaces that it keeps lit during the winter. I find it a very \ncomforting place. It was exactly one in the morning when I left, as that was \nwhen the pub closed on a Friday, and the only guests still remaining were a \ncolleague of mine named Andrew Barnet, my friend Leanne Hilliard and her \nhusband Mark. All of them will confirm my presence and the time of my \nleaving. I had originally planned to go home shortly after midnight, and my \nhousemate, Tamara Simpkin, had gone back at that time, but I had been in a \nrather heated discussion with Andrew and had stayed until last orders. On my \nway to the station I stopped into Crystal Kebab and bought a box of chips \nwhich I ate there. I ate slowly, as the wind had picked up and I was not keen to \ngo back out into the cold. \nBy the time I arrived at the station, I had missed what would have previously \nbeen the last Tube. It was with some relief that I realised the Victoria line, \nwhich would take me up to my home near Seven Sisters, had recently started \nrunning an all-night service on Fridays and Saturdays. I was somewhat \nreluctant to share my ride home with a carriage full of drunks, but that was \nalways the danger of drinking on a Saturday. So I made my way down the \nescalators and through the tunnels to the northbound Victoria Line platform. It \nwas deserted; not a single person was there beside myself. \n\nLooking down to the other end, I did see another figure, just one, but they \nwere walking away and out into the rest of the station. It was hard to tell from \na distance, but I believe he was holding a shovel of some sort. There hadn’t \nbeen a train for almost ten minutes, but at the time I didn’t think much of it. \nIt was eerie, waiting there, and maybe I should have taken it as a warning sign, \nbut there had been a lot of noise around me all night and now I was relishing \nthe quiet. I hoped that if the platform was this deserted, maybe the train \nwould be quiet as well. Perhaps I could even get a carriage to myself. \nThe train pulled up as normal. Maybe the brakes squealed a bit more than they \nshould have, but there was nothing that stood out to me as odd. Looking back, \nmaybe the train car was older than it should have been, or dustier, but I wasn’t \npaying that much attention and I didn’t get a good look at it afterwards. So \nwhen the doors opened, I stepped inside and took a seat. I turned out I’d been \nright, there wasn’t anybody else in the carriage at all. It was just me. My phone \nhad died two hours before, so I couldn’t listen to my music, and I just sat there \nin silence as the doors closed and the train began to move forward. At some \npoint the silence stopped being comforting and began to feel as though it were \npressing down on me. Even the rumble of the train’s movement seemed to be \nmuted, like it was being muffled somehow. \nI tried to take my mind off it. I scanned the adverts pasted above the row of \nchairs opposite me but they were blank. At least, they seemed blank when I \nfirst looked at them. Moving a bit closer I could see that there was something \nbehind the clear plastic. It was dirt. It looked as though each of the adverts had \nbeen covered in a layer of dry, tight-packed soil. I turned to the ones behind \nme, above my own chair, and saw the same thing. I reached up to touch one of", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 0, "chunk_count": 5, "chars": 4458}}
