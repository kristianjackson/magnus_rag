And then… This is the part I can't put into words. I'm going to try, \nbut whatever you think of when you read this is not going to be what \nhappened; it will just be the closest I can describe before thinking about it too \nmuch gives me a migraine. The closest I can say is this: the sky ate him. \nHe didn't fall, or fly, or take-off. There wasn't anything in the sky that took him. \nIt wasn't a hand that reached out and grabbed him, it was the sky itself, the \nwhole sky, as far as the horizon I could see, that twisted around and moved \nlike... like the shifting of sand. It ate Robert. That's the only way I can describe \nit. Please don't make me do so again. \nJONATHAN SIMS \nStatement ends. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG021 – Freefall \n8 \n \nBefore I address the central point of this statement, namely the question of… \nwhether the sky can eat people, there are a few other facts that need to be \naddressed. Firstly, the company that Ms. Kelly states Robert worked for, Open \nSkydiving, does not exist, and as far as Sasha's research can determine, never \nhas. It appears in no company register and has no entries within any of the \nbodies that deal with the immense number of licences a skydiving business \nwould require. There were one or two news articles from late 2000 that \nreference events by Open Skydiving, or sometimes the Open Skydiving School, \nbut whatever they were, they were not an officially licensed business, so either \nthey were lying to Robert Kelly, or he was lying to his mother. \nNot a lot of detail was given about the skydive where Robert Kelly claims to \nhave been transported to an endless sky blue nothing, but Tim really outdid \nhimself here, and after spending almost a day combing through accident and \nincident reports for the Doncaster area in June 2002, found one that seems \nrelevant. On the 3rd of June 2002, Joseph Puce reported hearing an impact in \nthe field adjoining his house. Upon investigation, he found a parachute had hit \nthe ground at high speed, partially burying itself in the earth. There was no sign \nof any body, or anyone who might have been wearing it, nor did it have any \nlogo or label, and in Tim's follow-up interview Mr. Puce vehemently denied \nthere being any planes or skydiving taking place anywhere near his property. \nThe parachute was unopened. \nAccording to police reports, Ms. Kelly attempted to report Robert missing on \n7th of June, but it proved difficult, due to an absence of any information on \nfriends or residences. In fact, for the four years prior, it's hard to find any \nevidence for Robert Kelly's existence at all. It may just be that he moved \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG021 – Freefall \n9 \n \naround a lot, but it feels like more than that. Ms. Kelly declined our request for \na follow-up interview, saying she had no desire to revisit the incident. \nOne other thing bothers me. If Ms. Kelly's recollections are correct, regarding \nhow Robert described his last skydive, Harriet Fairchild the instructor and an \nold man named Simon. It might just be a coincidence, but I recall the name \n‘Simon Fairchild’ was one of the ones used by… \n[A door opens and a chair crashes to the ground] \nJONATHAN SIMS \nMy god!
