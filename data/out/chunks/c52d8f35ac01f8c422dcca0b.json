You know you will. \nTIM \n(Bitter) Statement of Timothy Stoker, on the disappearance of... of my brother, \nDanny, four years ago. June 14th, 2017. \nMARTIN \nThank you. \nTIM \nStatement begins. \nTIM (STATEMENT) \nMy little brother Danny, he was always better than me. He was a couple of \nyears younger, but by the time he hit 21 he was already taller, fitter, better \nlooking. I mean, he didn’t have my winning sense of humour, but he didn’t \nneed it. Charisma, it wasn’t a problem for him. I think a lot of people in my \nsituation would have been… jealous, but not me. I was just proud of him. He \nwas always doing some, some charity race or endurance course, getting \n\nmodelling gigs, while I worked quietly away in publishing. And it made me \nsmile. \nI remember, he actually got a job doing some publicity shots for the company \nthat owned my local gym. There was a good five months where, whenever I \nwalked down to my offices, there he’d be, twice as large as life, smiling down \nfrom a poster, and challenging me to take them up on their joining fee, or lack \nthereof. I never did, but it always brought a smile to my face when I saw it. \nWe didn’t really talk much, me and Danny. We were still pretty close, and he’d \nusually keep me updated on whatever his latest obsession was. He tended to \nthrow himself into a thing completely for about six months, and well, then he’d \nget bored, and something new would catch his eye. Like, um, back in 2013, it \nwas urban exploration. He’d come down to London, stay with me for a couple \nof day,s and we’d end up having drinks with, er, Abigail Ellison, who’s a mutual \nfriend of ours from back home. Abi had been doing the urban exploration thing \non and off for a few years, and was telling us a few of her ‘close calls’ in some \nof the sites down near the old Docklands. As she talked, I was just watching \nDanny’s eyes light up, and I knew exactly what was happening. His passion for \nsailing was starting to wane after almost a year, and I was sure I was watching \nhim discover his next project. When Abi mentioned she had a trip lined up for \nthe old Millennium Mills in Newham, well, it was pretty much a done deal. At \nthe time I quite liked the idea. It wasn’t the weirdest thing to ever catch \nDanny’s attention, not by a long shot, and secretly I thought he and Abigail \nwould maybe make kind of a cute couple, so I was quite encouraging. Not that \nhe needed it. \n\nIt’s weird, isn’t it, the things that can change your life? You can plan for all the \ndevastating, terrible possibilities you can imagine, and it’ll always be those \ntiny, unexpected things that get you. \nYou know, the things that you never even noticed as they were happening, \njust… just nudging everything into motion. But even if there was a way I could \nhave known, I really don’t think I’d be able to have stopped him. \nSo, for the next few months that was it. My cool little brother was an urban \nexplorer. It suited him, and I got used to my phone buzzing at my office desk as \nhe filled it with pictures of his smiling face in front of some, I don’t know, \nrusted machine or hidden tunnel. He never did get together with Abi, but it \nonly took a couple of trips with her, and he’d learned what he needed. \nHe talked a few of his friends into it, like always, started going on trips further \nafield. I thought he’d be down in London more than he was, but it turns out \nthere are even more interesting abandoned places up north, and they tend to \nbe less guarded than they are down here, so that was where he spent most of \nhis time. \nThere was one thing that did draw him down to London though, what he \nreferred to as “ghost buildings”. There might have been some official name in \nthe urban exploration community, I don’t know; he stopped using the jargon \naround me after I joked that ‘urbex’ sounded like a brand of drain cleaner. \nWhat he was talking about was the places where newer buildings had been \nconstructed in or, I don’t know, over the remains of an earlier one, but \ndevelopment had left some of the old pieces intact. Sometimes, it was just a \nwall or two, made out of a different material, but occasionally there’d be an \nentire hidden basement or bricked up room. I don’t know why, but Danny", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 1, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 4273}}
