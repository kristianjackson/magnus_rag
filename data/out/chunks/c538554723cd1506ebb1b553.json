I \nmean, I knew about loan sharks and debt consolidation companies, and the \ndozens of other scams that prey on those in desperate situations like mine. \nThis was just going to be another of them. But the letter had been to me \nspecifically, and maybe, somewhere at the back of my mind, I was genuinely \nhoping for a way out. \nThe address they gave me was for a tall, thin building in Hammersmith that \nhoused about a half dozen law firms and a couple of tech start-ups. It didn’t \nlook like the sort of place that high-prestige businesses would have their \npremises, and more than one of the names listed on the plaque next to the \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 129 – Submerged \n9 \n \nrevolving door had been roughly scratched out, I assume indicating they were \nno longer in business. I asked at the front desk about Eberhardt and Straus and \nwas directed to an extremely cramped lift that rattled me up to the fourth \nfloor. \nThere was a buzzer next to their door, but it seemed to be broken and made \nno sound at all when I pressed it. My finger came away wet, and looking up, I \ncould see some sort of leak in the ceiling, dripping water down onto the \nbutton. I tried the handle, and the door opened quietly. The rooms beyond \nwere empty: bare wooden floors, no curtains or wallpaper, a few abandoned \nchairs or cheap-looking desks. The light switch did nothing, though the dull \ngrey light of a cloudy day filtered through the window bright enough to see by. \nEvery surface was damp, slick with old water and warped with mildew. It \ndripped slowly down the walls and seeped into the rotten wood of what \nfurniture was left. I could see a line of liquid in the bare lightbulbs. I was \nconfused, obviously I was, and stepped back out to doublecheck the door, and \nsure enough, these were offices of Eberhardt and Straus. I felt disgust rise in \nmy throat, the awful humid air of the waterlogged place sitting heavy in my \nlungs. I checked the draws in one of the desks, but even if the mushy pulp \ninside had once been paper, it wasn’t any more. Confused and angry, I turned \naround and left. It started raining on the walk home. \nWhen would you start to worry about the rain? I don’t mean about it ruining \nyour day or wrecking an event you’re planning, but at what point does it stop \nbeing normal and start to alarm you? I’ve lived my whole life in London, so I’ve \nseen plenty of rain in my time. I’ve lived through weeks where you catch what \nminutes you can when the sky closes for a moment and you can run to the bus \nstop. I’ve seen poorly maintained roads turn into tiny lakes and I’ve seen \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 129 – Submerged \n10 \n \nHackney Downs turned into a muddy swamp. So the first day didn’t worry me. \nThe rain pounded down steadily outside, and I sat in my bare, dismal home \nwaiting for my sister to pick me up. It drummed on the roof, rhythmic and \ninsistent, cascading off in tiny waterfalls and, just for a moment, I found myself \nalmost completely at peace. Then I felt a drop, heavy and wet, land on the \nback of my neck, and it shattered all at once. I looked up, and I saw the \nspreading patch of damp in the centre of my ceiling. Evicted or not, part of me \nrecoiled to see my home starting to finally crumble, as though my leaving \nwould take the last part of its hope. The water was warm and, after the heat of \nthe summer's day, I breathed in, expecting the smell of petrichor, but the scent \nof the rain was something else, something earthy and cloying I couldn’t quite \nplace. \nIt was a storm, there seemed to be no doubt of that, and I didn’t blame \nBhawana for not wanting to drive in this weather. I was a bit annoyed that she \nhadn’t called, but looking at my phone, it was clear it wasn’t getting any signal. \nNow that wasn’t necessarily a surprise, given the storm, but it did present me \nwith a problem. Namely, that my television and computer had already been \nsent over to my sister’s place, and without any signal, I was left with pretty \nmuch two options: sit doing nothing and listen to the rain, or head out into it. I \nopened the door for about three seconds before I decided that sitting and \nwaiting was the better choice. \nI walked upstairs, pulled a seat to the window overlooking the road, and I sat \nthere, watching. The drains were already starting to flood, puddles growing \naround the parked cars, reaching up and over, eager to meet in the middle, to \ntur", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 2, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 4500}}
