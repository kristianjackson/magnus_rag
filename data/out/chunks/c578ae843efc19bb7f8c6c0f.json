I point to the shiny white lump now lying on \nthe table. I don’t think she sees it, and if she does, she does not react. \nShe goes to get me more coffee. \nYour vision goes strange when you don’t sleep for a long time. I think it’s \nsomething to do with changing pressure on your eyeballs. You start to detect \nfaint movements on the edges, on the periphery, and if you stare too long at a \nflat surface it starts to gently pulse and move. I wrote a short story once where \nit was things trying to push through into our dimension, strange ghostly \ncreatures that could only be seen by those who had so deprived themselves of \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG074 – Fatigue \n5 \n \nrest that their mind opened itself. In the end the protagonist finally saw them \nfully, and they blinded her. But maybe it’s just the mind becoming too tired to \nproperly process the signals your eyes send. So much of what we see and hear \nare just useful lies that our brain tells us, filtering out the useless bits and \nadding in what it expects to see. No-one ever knows what they’re really seeing \nor hearing. \nThe billboard is damp. A sudden rainstorm has soaked it through and the paper \npeels away at the corner. The sky-blue blouse is now mottled and mouldy; the \nsmile has warped into a sneer. The coffee is still steaming, the swirls of the \nsteam unaffected by the rain, though the brightness in her eyes has turned \ninto a vicious glare. I can see the rust in the metal supports more clearly now, \nand they seem to bend ever so slightly when they groan. The text now reads: \n“Sleep is for the weak”. \nWhen you don’t sleep, your energy goes in cycles. Your body will go through \nphases where it seems to be trying to completely shut itself down, and keeping \nyour eyes open is quite literally a physical struggle. \nThen all at once you’ll enter a period of manic energy, a second, third or fourth \nwind that leaves you giddy and nauseous, struggling to find an outlet for your \nsudden rush. Sometimes there is a euphoria with this; other times it’s more \nlike desperation. As you get further and further into it, these cycles get closer \nand closer together, until your entire self seems to change hour by hour. Of \ncourse, when you have insomnia, it doesn’t matter how much your body tries \nto send you to sleep in the lulls, it simply doesn’t have the ability to do so. Like \nyour whole self is trying to push you into bed, but it is covered by a solid \ngranite block. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG074 – Fatigue \n6 \n \nThe man is back. This time I am on a bench in the park. The clouds roll and curl \ngently in the pale sky of dawn. He is twisting long blades of grass into strange \nspirals, but his fingers keep cutting through them instead. Is this when we \nmet? He looks at me, his face impassive... if I even see a face. He tells me that I \nlook terrible. I try to focus, but his body shifts and undulates like so much else \nwhen I try to focus. I tell him I haven’t slept, and he nods and tells me that’s ok. \nHe is lying, and it makes me very afraid. \nThey say that sleep is the most important factor in long-term health. Night \nworkers are apparently at risk for all sorts of problems but not nearly so much \nas shift workers who are never able to settle into a proper long-term sleep \nschedule. The body needs time to rest and repair itself. Caffeine and drugs and \nadrenaline can give you all the energy you need, but they can’t give you the \nrest that keeps you healthy. \nI don’t like to think about what this might be doing to my insides, what it might \nlead to in the future, but it doesn’t really matter. Time is not exactly as firm a \nconcept to me now as it perhaps once was. My head is too heavy to give much \nthought to a clock. \nI am running through the city. The alleyways are narrow and winding and do \nnot turn all the directions that they should. The smell chokes me and my body \nis heavy as stone. I lean against a wall and, for a second, I am unsure if I will \never be able to stand myself up again. I stagger through another street then I \nstop. I lie down on the tarmac and it is warm and soft under me. I feel sleep \nbegin to overtake me, but I am wrong. It is dawn, and all that comes over me is \nfaint and sickly sunlight. I can hear his laugh again, and my mouth tastes like \nburnt coffee.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 2, "chunk_count": 5, "chars": 4393}}
