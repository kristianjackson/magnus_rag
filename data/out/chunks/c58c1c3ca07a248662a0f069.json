And by less, I mean none. The walls were \nbare, unpainted, and for a horrible moment I thought it might already have \nbeen ransacked. Stavo had the same thought, but Grigori assured us that the \ncondition of the entrance indicated that it hadn't been opened since it was \noriginally sealed. The tomb hadn't been robbed; it was just empty. \nAs we headed deeper, I began to notice passages branching off our path. In \neach case they seemed to be heading more or less back the way we came. I \ncalled a halt and Stavo and I took a few minutes to explore one of them. At \nfirst, they seemed to be heading back towards the surface, but further \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 064 – Burial Rites \n \n8 \n \ncorridors branched off until we finally reached a dead end. Then another. And \nanother. It took longer than I was comfortable with to find the others again. \nIt was a labyrinth, not entirely unlike the one found at Hawara, but crucially, it \nseemed to only assume its deceptive, maze-like form when heading back \ntowards the entrance. When walking deeper in, it was rather straightforward. I \nmade these observations to Stavo and he immediately headed back out and \nreturned carrying the end of the jeep's winch. It was 150 feet in total and he \nfigured if the tomb ended up going deeper than that, we should probably \nreconsider our approach entirely. I could see he was getting irritated by these \ndelays and the lack of obviously bankable artefacts. I couldn't blame him – I \nwas starting to feel quite on edge myself. \nAs it turned out, the winch finished just within sight of the central chamber, so \nwe tied a torch to the end and headed inside. Like the rest, this room was \nsimple and plain, built out of rough limestone. It was completely empty, save \nfor a raised dais in the centre, about 3 feet off the floor. Lying there were the \nremains of an unpainted wooden sarcophagus. It had long since rotted away, \nthough the uncharacteristic copper bands that wrapped it still seemed in good \ncondition. Among the debris, I could see the pale wrapping of the corpse, tight \naround in a way that reminded me disconcertingly of a straightjacket. It had \nworn away in many places, leaving the flesh of the mummy itself on show, dark \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 064 – Burial Rites \n \n9 \n \nblack and almost shiny in the torchlight. There was nothing else there at all. No \ntreasures and no other exits. \nIt was at that point that Stavo lost it a bit. He'd spent a lot of money on this \nexpedition and to find that there was nothing there except an old corpse and \nsome shards of wood was a significant problem for him. I mean, the \narchitectural implications of the place in terms of mid to late fourth dynasty \nconstruction practices were kind of amazing, but I didn't think that was \nsomething he wanted to hear just then, so I kept quiet. We all did. When Stavo \ngot angry, it was best to just let it run its course, rather than trying to talk him \ndown from it and draw his anger your way. \nI busied myself making another loop of the room, in case there were any secret \nentrances that I'd missed, while behind me he stood there, swearing. I did \nnotice something in the corner though. About a half dozen small bones, with \ncarvings on each face. Dice. I knew that dice games pre-dated the Old Kingdom \nby some time and these were excellent quality. I decided to wait until Stavo \nhad finished ranting before I drew his attention to them. \nI turned to see him leaning over the corpse, rage on his face like it was \nsomehow this dead Egyptian's fault that the trip had been a bust. I had to stop \nmyself laughing, until I saw that he might actually punch the thing. The", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 3, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 3736}}
