I know that this can’t have been easy to arrange and I \nappreciate the opportunity to make my statement. The Prison Service probably \ndidn’t make it easy for you. They’re understandably hesitant to give anyone \nextended access to me in case I get violent, but I’m very glad they made an \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG019 – Confession \n2 \n \nexception for you. At least, assuming that you’re real. I hope you’re real but \nmaybe it’s that hope that’s being used against me in a cruel joke. Or maybe the \njoke would be that I would let that doubt cost me my only chance to tell my \nstory. Either way, I choose to make my statement and if you’re not real then \nhopefully no harm done. \nWe’ll get to the cannibalism, of course, but first I just want to provide some \ncontext. I don’t know how much you work with the Church in your Institute. \nYou may be surprised that a man of the cloth such as myself, however far from \ngrace I may have fallen, would enlist the aid of an organisation dedicated to \nstudying the paranormal. Well, to be honest, it’s generally kept quiet, but the \nCatholic Church is not against belief in the supernatural outside of the official \ndoctrine. Demons, ghosts, black magic... It’s generally up to the individual how \nmuch they believe in these things, and I believe that very much of what you \nresearch is real. Dangerous, but real. I’ve always seen the Devil’s work as a very \ntangible thing, and those priests who might speak of them as metaphor or \nsymbol are, I fear, often placing themselves and their parishioners in a position \nof peril. Sorry, this is becoming a homily. It’s just been some time since I’ve had \na chance to express myself like this; I almost don’t care if it is on one of Its \nphantasms. \nSo it was only natural, I suppose, that it was relatively early in my vocation as a \npriest that I trained as an exorcist. It’s not something all that special really, \nevery diocese should have a trained exorcist available, or failing that a bishop \ncan do it, but nine times out of ten the duties of an exorcist are to recommend \na good psychiatrist, doctor or substance abuse program, and bishops don’t \nusually have time for that. I was an exorcist for the Diocese of Oxford when \nthis all happened. I trained as a Jesuit, so I was used to moving about a lot, but", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 0, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 3146}}
