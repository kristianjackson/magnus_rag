But is it… true? For a moment, Elias really can’t remember. \nRight here and now, the thought of a spider genuinely repulses him. \n[Chair squeaks start as Elias shifts uncomfortably] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nThe image of a scuttling, filthy creature, eight eyes glinting out in the darkness, \ncrawls into his mind, and he shudders, looking away for a second. But the \nuninvited thought keeps going. \n[Fabric and itching sounds, that intensify] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nHe imagines the spider moving up his leg, his body, he imagines feeling its \nbristling hairs against the skin of his shoulder, his throat, his cheek. It’s spindly \nprobing legs finding their way up his face. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 193 – A Stern Look \n \n11 \n[Crawling insect sounds join the itching] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nElias can’t stop himself picturing that spider sat there, venom dripping from \nfangs that hang, poised over his eye. He can’t shut his eye. \n[Polite cough; itching, movement and insect sounds stop] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nA cough from over the desk breaks his train of thought. His interviewer is \nstaring at him, and all at once he’s back with himself, burning with \nembarrassment. Those eyes stare, impassive and stern as ever, but... is that a \ntwinkle of satisfaction? As though he has been given an answer he likes. The \nnext question comes slowly, and Elias tries to squash down the fear growing in \nhis chest. \nJONAH/ELIAS \nSo tell me. Have you ever had an experience that you would consider \nsupernatural? \n[Memory brings up the buzzing of flies; Elias’ ticking clock is \nreplaced with a rapidly ticking clock] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nAnd immediately Elias is in that room again, fumbling for the light switch, \nsmelling the coppery scent of old blood mixed with the crusty odour of a room \nthat has been hot-boxed a little bit too often. The memory is as fresh and vivid \nas the day it happened. He knows that Allan is dead, but he needed the light to \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 193 – A Stern Look \n \n12 \nbe sure, to see it for himself. He finds it, and the switch feels slippery beneath \nhis fingers. \n[Switch is clicked, and there is the sound of disgust and retching] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nWhen the light comes on, Elias has no idea how much of the crimson that \nbathes the scene is from the blood on the walls, how much from the blood that \ntints the lightbulb, and how much is simply the shading of his memory. But he \nremembers so clearly what he was thinking as he looked at what was left of \nAllan Schrieber: where are his eyes? What did they do with his eyes? \n[Sounds from the memory end; replaced with Elias’ office clock \nticking] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \n“No…,” Elias tries to say, though his mouth is dry and his head is swimming. \n“No, I don’t, uh, I don’t think...” \nJames Wright says nothing as another memory bubbles up from inside Elias, \nlike the last scream of a drowning diver. \n[Sound of pages turning in a book and general ambience of quiet \nbut large area; a different clock ticks] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nAllan is in the library, irritated at the interruption, but happy to see a friendly \nface. The whites of his eyes are riddled with the scarlet veins of sleeplessness, \nbut his hand trembles with a feverish energy as he tries to explain the \nsignificance of the book he’s found.
