The first was the crew. They were quiet. Very quiet. I \nmean, I’ve been on ships where I was pretty much the only native English \nspeaker, and plenty of people prefer to keep to themselves. Hell, not being too \ncomfortable around people is a damn fine reason to go to sea. This was \ndifferent, though. \nIt wasn’t just that they didn’t talk much, they seemed uncomfortable with me. \nThey’d avoid eye contact, and only barely acknowledge me if we were on a \nshift together. As first I thought it was because I was a woman, but then I saw \nthat it wasn’t just me. They avoided each other just as much as they did me. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG033 – Boatswain’s Call \n9 \n \nMeals were always quiet, no matter how many people were eating, and there \nwas no friendly games of cards or chat in living quarters. There was no real \nconversation in any language. It was like they were doing everything in their \npower not to think about each other. It took me less than a day of ignored \nhellos and grunted answers before I fell into line, becoming just as quiet as my \ncrewmates. \nThe only person who spoke was Tadeas Dahl. The mate would walk among the \ncrew, giving instructions and orders in a dozen different languages, as the crew \nscrambled to carry out his commands. He was just as composed as he had \nbeen when I met him, and it soon became clear that, if he had emotions, he \nkept a tight wrap on them. He would stride along the ship, his antique whistle \nswinging from his neck. He never actually blew the boatswain’s call, apparently \npreferring to summon the crew via the intercom or horn. It just hung there, its \npolished brass heavy around his neck. I didn’t see Captain Lukas at all that first \nweek. I only knew he was onboard because every meal time the cooks would \nhand a tray of food to the mate, who’d take it up to the captain’s cabin. We \nnever saw the man himself, though. \nThere was one crewmember who did catch my eye. He was a young guy, white \nand, from what I could tell, Scottish. I never really got more than his name out \nof him: Sean Kelly. He had the bunk opposite me, and we were on different \nshifts, so I would often see him lying there when I returned from my night \nwatch. He didn’t talk any more than the others, but he also didn’t go around \nwith that blank look on his face. He looked scared. \nThere were other odd things about the ship, but hands down the weirdest \nthing, I didn’t notice until a few days out into the Atlantic.
