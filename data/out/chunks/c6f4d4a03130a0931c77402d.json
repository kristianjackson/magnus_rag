So he watches her until she simply fades away. \n \nAnd at last, the Archivist looks up. At last he looks into the eye that sees all and \nknows all and clutches at the secret terrors of your heart. The ceaseless \nwatcher of all that is and all that was. The voracious infinite hunger that tears \nat his soul, invoking him to discover, to observe, to experience all and \neverything and forever. It stares into him and it stares out of him and he is \nfalling into the devouring eternity of its pupil. He wants to cry out in horror, \nbut he cannot. He is whole. \n \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG120 – Eye Contact \n \n7 \n \nAnd still he does not wake. Wandering his slim collection of gifted nightmares, \npassing the grey and lifeless remains of severed dreams he can no longer \nwatch. He waits, but not for long, before they all begin again. \n \nYou are doing well, John. I only hope you can continue your growth without my \nguidance. \n \n(Knock at door; Elias sighs) \n \nCome in. \n \n(Door opens) \n \nHello, Inspector. Martin. I’m, uh, sorry to hear about Tim. \n \nMARTIN \nDon’t. \n \nELIAS \nAnd Daisy, I suppose. \n \nMARTIN \nDon’t you dare. \n \nELIAS \nI suppose it’s some consolation Basira made it out, and John… more or less. \n \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG120 – Eye Contact \n \n8 \n \nINSPECTOR \n(Hurried) Is this is him? \n \nMARTIN \nY-yes. \n \nINSPECTOR \nRight. Elias Bouchard, you’re under arrest. \n \nELIAS \nOn what crime? \n \nINSPECTOR \n(Shrugging) Take your pick. Never had a tape recording of a murder before, \nsomething of a novelty. And that’s not the half of it; plenty of stuff in those \nfiles could easily get you a nasty end if you weren’t careful. \n \nELIAS \nHuh. No Melanie? I’d have thought she would have wanted to gloat. \n \nMARTIN \nN-no, I, I— \n \nELIAS \nYou didn’t tell her. Worried she might create too much of scene. I understand. \nI just hope she doesn’t hold it against you. \n \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG120 – Eye Contact \n \n9 \n \nMARTIN \nThat’s… look, that’s none— \n \nINSPECTOR \n(Loudly) Don’t worry, Mr Blackwood. We will take it from here. \n \nELIAS \nI’m sure you will. However, before we proceed, I have a flash drive in my shirt \npocket. Please ensure it gets to Chief Inspector Henderson. It contains various \ninformation I think she and the metropolitan police would be keen not to have \nreleased to the public. \n \nINSPECTOR \nYes, I was briefed that would probably the case. Can’t let you go, though, not \nwith all the evidence kindly provided by your colleagues. \n \nELIAS \nI quite understand. I would just hate for my case to be too… truncated. \n \nINSPECTOR \nNot my place to say, Mr Bouchard. I’m just here to get you behind bars. You \nand the chief can discuss the rest. \n \nMARTIN \n(Quietly) It’s better than you deserve. \n \nELIAS \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG120 – Eye Contact \n \n10 \n \nPerhaps so, but I’m glad you were sensible about it. I was concerned you might \nhave bought into Melanie’s… fixation. \n \nINSPECTOR \nThey gave you to us all but wrapped up in a bow. \n \nELIAS \nI must admit I’m impressed, Martin. I knew you were all planning something, of \ncourse, but I didn’t believe you specifically would have the, ah, capacity for \nboldness that you displayed. Took me quite by surprise. \n \nMARTIN \nYou didn’t just see it in me? \n \nELIAS \nHonestly, I didn’t look. For all my power, I will admit I am not immune to \nmaking the occasional lazy assumption. I presumed that I knew you \nthoroughly, but by the time you demonstrated otherwise… Well, there was \nsimply too much to keep watching over. I only have two eyes, after all. \n \nINSPECTOR \nRight. Are you all done now? \n \nELIAS \nI believe so. I think we should be fine, provided you make sure the data \nreaches the Chief Inspector.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 3, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 3829}}
