We were real stupid back then. And when Alberto’s parents \noffered to sell us their second home in Cheadle, we thought it was a great \ninvestment: nice and quiet, good neighbourhood, just a real nice home for the \ntwo of us, and so much bigger than anything we could afford in the city. And \nbefore you think Cheadle the suburb of Manchester, that’s not the one I’m \ntalking about. I’m talking about Cheadle, the suburb of Stoke-on-Trent. Hell, \ntechnically it’s not even a suburb. It’s just a village that looks so much like a \nsuburb that you could pull it up drop it on the edge of any dull town in England \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 150 – Cul-de-Sac \n \n3 \n \nand it would look the same. Just street after street of identical, blandly \npleasant houses, all winding around each other in dead ends and cul-de-sacs \nand one-way streets, making sure every house has plenty of inoffensive \ngarden. I’ve never seen people happily living in a place so obviously dead. \nTwo years we lived there : two years imprisoned in that beige, comfortable \nhouse with the man I loved, watching our relationship turn to sniping and \nsnapping and bitter passive aggression. I’d say that cheating on him was a \nfoolish act of past me, but honestly, it’s one of the few decisions I’ve ever \nmade that I completely understand. I didn’t even try to hide it, not really, and \nwhen he found out and it all ended, I kind of hated myself for just how relieved \nI was that I’d finally be able to leave that place, to get in my car and drive away \nfrom that gentle suburban nightmare. I mean, I’d lived there for two years and \nI still got lost trying to leave. I thought that was the worst that place would \never make me feel. Wish I’d been right. \nI got a cheap apartment in Liverpool and tried to tell myself I was happier. The \nsingle life, footloose and ... sitting at home binging bad TV. I tried to get back \ninto the club scene, but honestly, I think I’m just too old now. The music was \ntoo loud, the drinks were too expensive and the sort of thing I used to take to \nbe dancing all night now hit me with a comedown so hard that I had to write \noff almost the entire week. It didn’t help that, over the course of a ten-year \nrelationship, “my friends” had become “our friends” and there weren’t any of \nthem siding with me in this situation. Some would drop platitudes about \nmaybe reconnecting after the fallout was done with, but I know when I’m \nbeing handled by people who “don’t want to create any more drama”. It was \nmiserable, but every time I thought about going back, I felt nauseous.
