Statement begins. \nDAISY (STATEMENT) \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 061 – Hard Shoulder \n \n10 \n \nThis was a long time ago. I’d been police for two years. Wasn’t even with the \nMet back then. I was based up in Lancashire with the Road Policing Unit. This \nwas before the Highways Agency took most of the grunt work, so there was \nplenty to do. None of it much fun, but it needed doing. Booking drink drivers \nwas my favourite. I always hoped they’d refuse the breathalyser, maybe even \ntake a swing at me. Nothing funnier than a drunk arsehole trying to avoid being \narrested. \nI usually rode with Isaac Masters. He’d been working with the RPU a lot longer \nthan I had and was even harsher than me. I know why though. You try to be a \ngood police, give everyone a fair shot, but you see a lot of accidents. Not much \nworse in the world than a really bad car crash. It gets to you. You get hard with \npeople who don’t respect the road and there are plenty of them out there. \nIt was raining that night. That heavy, thumping rain that means you can’t hear \na damn thing. It crashes onto the roof like someone’s jumping on it. Me and \nZac were sitting in a lay-by watching traffic and trying to drink coffee. We’d \npicked it up from a service station a few miles back, but it was one of those \nopen-topped styrofoam cups. By the time we’d got back to the car, the rain \nhad got in and left us with two cups of cold sludge. So we were both in a pretty \nbad mood. It was maybe one in the afternoon, but you wouldn’t have known \nit. The clouds weren’t letting any sun through and everything looked grey, wet \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 061 – Hard Shoulder \n \n11 \n \nand lifeless. We couldn’t even talk over the sound of rain on the roof, so we \njust sat there in silence, drinking lukewarm sludge. \nThe motorway was quieter than normal. A Wednesday afternoon doesn’t see a \nlot of traffic, but the rain usually brings out more cars. That day it was pretty \nempty. Everyone seemed to be driving careful on account of the rain, which \nwas also not normal, and I was torn. Part of me wanted to spot some idiot who \nI could take my bad mood out on, when the other part of me didn’t want to get \nany wetter than I already was. It looked like I wasn’t going to get a choice \nanyway. At least, not until I saw the van. \nIt was a beaten-up old Citroën C15. There was some writing on the side, but I \ncouldn’t see it clearly through the rain. It was either very dirty or painted a \nnasty shade of off-white. Most importantly, it was driving about 25 miles an \nhour. The limit is 70. There’s technically no minimum speed on a motorway, \nbut the van didn’t show any signs of speeding up and it was kind of strange. \nWe had enough cause to stop it if we wanted. I wasn’t sure whether to let it go \nor not, but Zac had clearly made his decision already. He was in the driving \nseat, and fired up the lights as we drove up behind it. The van glided to a stop \non the hard shoulder at the side of the road and sat there. The headlights, \nwhich had been turned on for the rain, died. Then it just waited.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 1, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 3748}}
