I needed to get a sense of exactly what I was \ndealing with. Even from the road, I could see a steady stream flowing out the \nopen door and over the step. \nI kitted up with pesticide spray and headed in for a closer look. I wouldn’t \nnormally bother using spray on ants, but this wasn’t normal and the formula I \nwas using worked on ants just fine. That said, I didn’t actually see any of them \ndie. I wouldn’t have expected to immediately anyway, and what was important \nis that wherever I sprayed, they fled, clearing a path of discoloured floor for me \nto walk. It was slow going, but I got through most of the ground floor like that \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 055 – Pest Control \n \n8 \n \nand didn’t see anything except more ants. No people, no furniture, nothing. At \nleast until I reached the kitchen and saw the fridge. \nThere was nothing else in that kitchen. Even the sink had been removed, \nleaving just the water pipes sticking out of the wall like rusty, diseased bones. \nBut up against the far wall stood an old fridge. Its once white skin was now a \njaundiced yellow and I couldn’t quite shake the feeling that it was pulsing ever \nso gently. A thick, black mass of ants swarmed from the crack in its door and I \nhad no doubt that whatever was at the heart of this incredibly unpleasant \nsituation, it was going to be in that fridge. So, I decided it was probably a good \nidea to step outside for a cigarette before I opened it. \nThe air outside seemed much fresher as I left the house. I walked a few yards \naway from the door, so that I wasn’t too close, and then I lit up. It was as I took \nthe first drag that I saw a car pull up to the driveway. It was a small, red \ncompact and the licence plate seemed to indicate that it had only been bought \nthe year before, but even so, I could see the rust starting to bubble the paint \nnear the edges of the panelling. I watched as the door opened and a man \nstepped out. He was tall, maybe six and a half feet, but it was hard to be sure \nof his shape inside the huge, brown suit he was wearing. He took one look at \nme, then the sign on the side of my van that read ‘Kennedy Pest Control’ and \nhis face began to crease with rage. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 055 – Pest Control \n \n9 \n \nI took another drag on my cigarette. I was uneasy about the whole situation \nand was waiting to see what the strange looking man would do. He walked up \nto me, great strides that brought him close enough that I could see the \nunhealthy gloss of sweat on his skin. Was everything here sick? He leaned in \nfar closer than I was comfortable with and demanded to know what I was \ndoing. I told him that the homeowner had hired me to take care of an ant \ninfestation and I’d been doing a preliminary sweep. \nHe started to shake his head violently, saying that he was the homeowner, that \nthis was his house and I had no business being there. Well, those weren’t his \nexact words. What he actually said was that I had no business “plying my vile \ntrade on his property”. I was about to get out my phone and call the woman \nwho hired me, when his hand shot out without warning and grabbed me by \nthe throat. He lifted me off my feet with a strength that terrified me, and I was \nvery glad that, even with the hood down, my protective suit kept my neck \ncovered. I could feel his hand through the thick plastic; it was hot, like he was \nrunning some incredibly high fever, and I started to panic. \nHe held me there, almost a foot off the ground, and my vision began to swim \nas he squeezed my throat. As I struggled for breath, I flailed for something to \nfight him off with and realised that I was still holding my lighter.
