So the guy was mad, or...? \nARCHIVIST \nNo it-it… I mean, yes. It’s sort of, like… gaslighting, but in reverse. This place, \nit’s built on the fear that your mental health problems aren’t actually real. \nBASIRA \nWouldn’t that be a good thing? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 177 – Wonderland \n33 \nARCHIVIST \nN-No… I’m not explaining it very well. Uh, it’s... It’s the worry that everything \nis, is awful, and it’s actually your fault. Th-That you made it up? That um… that \nyou’re... \nBASIRA \nWhat? \nARCHIVIST \n(Exhales) Bad therapists. Let’s just say it’s the fear of bad therapists, filtered \nthrough The Spiral. \nBASIRA \nThat’s... a lot more nuanced than I’ve gotten used to since everything went \nwrong. \nARCHIVIST \nYes, well, The Spiral is nothing if not insidious. \nMARTIN \n(Nervously) Uh... Is that door meant to be open? And... dripping blood. \nARCHIVIST \nWe’re here. \n[The stop walking; the door creaks as it is pushed further open] \nMARTIN \nOh, Jesus. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 177 – Wonderland \n34 \nARCHIVIST \nYes. Horrible way to go. \nBASIRA \nYou’re sure this is Daisy’s handiwork? \nARCHIVIST \nPositive. \n[Hissing static starts] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nShe’d been prowling around for a long time, waiting for a gap in the \n‘treatments.’ And when she got one, she carved through the door like it was \npaper. He tried to run, but she was so fast. She took his legs first, slicing \nthrough the tendons so that he could— \nBASIRA \nEnough. We get it. \n[Hissing static ends] \n(Beat) \n(Turning) Let’s go, then. \nMARTIN \nWait, what? That’s it? \nBASIRA \nWhat else is there? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 177 – Wonderland \n35 \nMARTIN \nSeriously? I mean, who is this guy? Daisy slaughters someone, and you don’t \neven want to know why? You… What, you don’t care? \nBASIRA \n(Uncomfortably) We don’t have time. \nARCHIVIST \n…I could tell you. \nBASIRA \nDon’t bother. I know who he is. \nMARTIN \nWhat? \nBASIRA \n(Sigh) Noah Thomson. He’s a, nasty piece of work. Crossed him a few times \nwhen we weren’t doing sectioned work. Last I heard he’d dodged a GBH \ncharge Daisy brought him in on. Blinded a guy during a robbery. I guess she \ndidn’t forget. \nMARTIN \nWait, wait… so... so, she’s hunting down criminals? People who she thinks got \naway with stuff? \nBASIRA \n...Sure. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 177 – Wonderland \n36 \nARCHIVIST \nReally? As simple as that? \nBASIRA \nWhat’s your point? \nARCHIVIST \nWhat, you think he ended up in Wonderland House at random? We’re just \ngoing to ignore it, and write him off as a ‘nasty piece of work’? \nBASIRA \nWe don't have time for this. \nARCHIVIST \nThen we should make time. You want to hear how he ended up blinding that \nman? Because it wasn’t a robbery. He was running away from Daisy, lashing \nout in a panic. The court believed it. But you believed her... \nBASIRA \n(Angry) I told you not to look in my head! \nARCHIVIST \nI didn't. And I won't. But you can’t hunt a monster that you refuse to see. \n(Beat) \n[A sudden ‘bing’ of an elevator arriving; the doors open] \n[A high-pitched tone starts] \n(Sounds of fearful surprise from Martin) \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 177 – Wonderland \n37 \nHELEN \nNot interrupting anything, am I? \n[Footsteps as Helen exits the lift] \nMARTIN \nChrist, Helen, you scared the life out of me. \nHELEN \n(Insincere) Sorry darling. \n[Elevator doors close] \nARCHIVIST \nNot now, Helen. \nHELEN \nI’m sorry to butt in, but I was paying a visit to dear old Doctor David. You know, \nthis place goes through nurses at an alarming rate, and I couldn’t help but \noverhear your little problem. \nBASIRA \nReally don’t need your opinion on this. \nHELEN \nGood to see you too, Basira. You’re looking well. And don’t worry, I’ve no \ninterest in your little ethical wobbles. No, I mean your issue with a certain feral \nrunaway.
