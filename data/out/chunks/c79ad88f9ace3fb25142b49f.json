It was written all over his panicked face; he had \nseen them. \nI watched as he decided whether or not to try and run. There was a moment I \nwas sure he was going to literally bolt for the door, but instead he sighed and \nnodded his head. It was four years ago, he told me, at The Good Ship in \nKilburn. Lee had been watching an up-and-coming metal band whose name he \ncould no longer recall – they'd been fine, a bit disappointing, so he was in a \nmood to finish his drink and leave. The rest of the audience seemed to be of a \nsimilar mind, so nobody noticed when a man climbed onto the stage, and set \nup a small keyboard. \nThe man was short, so Lee said, and painfully thin, wearing a ratty, old brown \nsuit that draped around him like, in Lee's words, “flaps of ill-fitting skin”. His \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG042 – Grifter’s Bone \n5 \n \nthinning black hair was slicked back, and his face had a strange look of cruelty \nto it. As he placed his fingers on his instrument, they left behind dark red spots \non the bright white keys. Lee said he had never heard of Grifter's Bone before \nthat moment, but somehow he knew that’s what he was looking at. And then \nthe music started. \nAfter he said this, Lee went very quiet. It was clear he was concentrating very \nhard. I waited, not wanting to interrupt, but in the end he just shook his head. \nHe couldn't remember the music, he said. He'd tried, but it was just blank. He'd \ncome back to himself wandering the streets of Kilburn almost two hours later, \nhis shirt soaked in blood. Mostly his blood. At this, Lee unbuttoned his shirt \nand showed me a series of vivid scars slashed onto his chest. The hospital had \nsaid it was likely a box cutter of some sort, but he had no memory of it. \nBy then it looked like he was on the verge of tears, but I couldn't leave it alone. \nI asked about his ears. He actually laughed at this and said no, he hadn't torn \nthem off. Reaching up, Lee pulled back his long, blond hair to reveal an ear \nthat, at first glance, appeared normal. Looking closer, though, I saw that he \nwas wearing earplugs, flesh-coloured, so as not to be obvious, and caked \naround the edges of them was a ring of dried blood. He said it was the only \nway he'd found to stop it dripping down and ruining his shirts. \nI was a bit freaked out at this. Understandably, I think, though it was entirely \nmy own fault, and I had told him he needed to see a doctor if his ears wouldn't \nstop bleeding. Lee just shook his head, said he'd seen enough doctors to know \nthey couldn't help, and that he had learned to copewith it. We drank the rest \nof the night in silence, before heading our separate ways. I know I should have \nleft it alone after that, and I certainly didn't bother Lee again. But I found I, I \njust couldn't let it go. Either Lee was mad, or Grifter's Bone was real. I started", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 2, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 2865}}
