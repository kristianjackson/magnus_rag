In context. \nARCHIVIST \nI’m not sure I follow? \nGEORGIE \nWhat I mean is, if there’s no-one above you, there’s no-one to point out you’re \ndoing everything wrong. \nARCHIVIST \nLook, can we put my professional competence to one side, please. Because I’m \ntrying to tell you monsters are real! \nGEORGIE \nOkay. \nARCHIVIST \nOkay? Okay, what? \nGEORGIE \nOkay, I know monsters are real and I… assume there’s more? \nARCHIVIST \nI… erm, you, you know? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG093 – Contaminant \n14 \n \nGEORGIE \nYeah. \nARCHIVIST \nY-You just believe me? \nGEORGIE \nYeah, I mean, it’s not belief. I’ve seen them. \nARCHIVIST \nYou’ve seen monsters? \nGEORGIE \nNot the time, John. \nARCHIVIST \nRight, it’s… it’s just, I think I’m turning into one. \nGEORGIE \nReally? That’s… not great. \nARCHIVIST \nYeah. Ever since I took this job, I’ve felt a compulsion to read out some of the \nstatements. The ones that really touched the supernatural. And when I do… I… \nI feel them. I feel their confusion and fear. I tried to write it off, but… And, and I \ncan make people tell me their stories. Anytime I ask a question, people just… \nanswer. \nGEORGIE \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG093 – Contaminant \n15 \n \nOkay, well that bit… will need some proof. \nARCHIVIST \nFine, er… What is something you would never choose to tell me? \nGEORGIE \nWhen we first met I thought you were putting on that accent to sound more \nimpressive. Oh. Oh, John… I’m so sorry. \nARCHIVIST \nOh… No, it’s alright. I, er, I mean, I-I guess I did exaggerate it. It’s a long time \nago, anyway. Proof? \nGEORGIE \nYeah. Yeah, I guess so. \nARCHIVIST \nThe Institute is… There are beings. Like, weird gods, or powers, or… something. \nThey’re outside our universe somewhere, but they push through sometimes in \nthe form of these monsters. A-A-And sometimes they choose people to be… \ner, servants? Conduits? \nGEORGIE \nAvatars? \nARCHIVIST \nAvatars! But they end up getting these abilities, and they lose a lot of their self. \nSometimes all of it. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG093 – Contaminant \n16 \n \nGEORGIE \nAnd you think… that’s what’s happening to you? \nARCHIVIST \nYes. Yes. The Institute serves one of these beings. A-At least, Elias, who runs \nthe place, does. Since accepting the Archivist job, I-I’ve been… different. A-And \nI can’t quit or, apparently, do any violence to him. I’m bound somehow. \nGEORGIE \nThat does at least explain why he picked you. \nARCHIVIST \nUh? \nGEORGIE \nIf your job is asking questions, I mean. You were always the one who pushed \ntoo far, and asked smart-arse, awkward questions. I always was surprised you \nnever got punched. \nARCHIVIST \nWell, I think that bit of luck’s run out. \nGEORGIE \nSo, you’ve discovered your boss is evil, making you kind of evil, and you can’t \nquit, so you… fled here? \nARCHIVIST \nAnd… there were some… murders. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG093 – Contaminant \n17 \n \nGEORGIE \nOh. Ah. I assume that’s why I had the police asking after you? \nARCHIVIST \nOh, they came here? \nGEORGIE \nIt’s fine, you were asleep. Anyway, that – \nARCHIVIST \nWh– \nGEORGIE \n– that makes sense, but it doesn’t explain the hand. \nARCHIVIST \nOh, that was… that was one of the other… ‘avatars’. \nGEORGIE \nOf your guy, or…? \nARCHIVIST \nNo, no. My… my patron is focused on knowledge and observation. Elias calls it \nThe Eye, but I’ve also heard it called Beholding, or Ceaseless Watcher… a lot of \nnames. This one was… The Lightless Flame, or, or I think she called it The \nDesolation. It’s burning, destruction, pain. All the bad bits of fire without any of \nthe light or joy. \nGEORGIE", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 5, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 3799}}
