They stood empty and still, silhouetted against that \ndull orange of a cloudy sky that glowed with light pollution. As I got closer I \nstarted to get jumpy, and I swear more than once I saw figures sat in the \nbroken windows of those old trains. They were never there when I looked \nagain. \nFinally, I saw it, the stark, angular shape clear even in the dark. It was far \nenough from the security stations that I finally dared to turn on my torch. The \nlight hit the dull steel, casting long shadows into its crevices, and it somehow \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG076 – The Smell of Blood \n7 \n \nseemed heavier than it should have been. It was old, really old, but there was \nno rust on its edges. \nThe smell of blood was almost choking. I began to walk towards the large \nsliding door, but as I did so my torchlight caught on something tucked in the \ncorner of the panelling. It seemed to be a serial number, stencilled in black \npaint. It was clear and legible, despite its age, and surrounded by patches of \nstill-unpeeled green paint. The colour of made me think of the army. I took a \nfew seconds to jot it down for checking later, then reached up and slid the \nlarge metal door to the side, shining my light inside. \nAt first it still seemed dark, and I couldn’t see much. My light hit the opposite \nwall, but it was the same featureless steel as the outside. Then my torch beam \ndrifted downwards, and I caught sight of the thick red stream dripping from \nthe now-open side of the car. The floor of the carriage was about chest height \nfor me, and as I looked I could saw it was streaked with trails of blood that led \ndown to the doorway. I traced my light up and along the shallow red stream \nand it hit what looked like an old metal hospital gurney. The fabric that \ncovered it was that same military green as outside, and the body that lay on it \nwas covered in a white cotton bag, stained black near the bottom. It wasn’t \nlying still, either, but it twitched and writhed as though in pain. \nI wanted to run, but without warning a shape ran out of the darkness to my \nleft. There was a glint of shining metal in its hand as it charged over to the \ntwitching white body bag, and began to plunge the scalpel into it again and \nagain and again. It looked like a man. He was maybe mid-twenties, dressed in \narmy fatigues and wearing a white armband with a red cross on it. His eyes, \nthough, they... they weren’t human. I mean, they were, but everything in them \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG076 – The Smell of Blood \n8 \n \nthat makes us people was gone. The only thing in those eyes was violence. \nCarnage. \nARCHIVIST \nBlood. \nMELANIE \nYeah... blood. I was so fixed on those eyes I didn’t even notice him run at me. I \nwas only when I felt the scalpel slice into my shoulder that I realised what was \nhappening and thought to scream. Next thing I knew, I was being carried away \nby security guards. They were shouting at me, while I ranted at them about \nblood and ghosts. I only had a chance to look back at the carriage once. It was \ntoo dark inside to be sure, but I... I think it was empty. They couldn’t decide \nwhether to call the police or the ambulance, so split the difference and called \nboth. The cut was nasty, but not deep enough to do any real damage; as you \nsaw, I’m getting quite a scar from it. Still, it meant that even though I was \ntechnically arrested, I got to go in the ambulance rather than the police car. \nThe guys from the scrapyard told them I’d cut myself in the dark on a sharp \npiece of metal. I started screaming at them, trying to tell them what actually \nhappened. That must have been when that dog-walker, or whoever the hell it \nwas, started filming. I was actually a meme for a day or two. \nYou do know what that is, don’t you? \nARCHIVIST \nYes, I know what a meme is. You were saying? \nMELANIE", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 3, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 3998}}
