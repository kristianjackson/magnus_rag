Sparing a glance at \nhis own wrapped form, he said that touching the man would have been a “bad \nidea”. He seemed to be in tremendous pain as he spoke, but did his best to \nhide it. \nI didn’t say anything then. I wanted to ask what was happening and it seemed \nlike he was waiting for me to do just that, but something stopped me. \nSomething told me that if there was a coherent explanation for everything that \nhad happened since the ambulance arrived, then I would be no better off for \nknowing it. After a few seconds of awkward silence, Gerard spoke. He asked \nme if the paramedics had brought any items in with them. Specifically, he was \nafter a small book bound in red leather and a brass pendant he had been \nwearing. He didn’t say what design had been on the pendant but I guessed it \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG012 – First Aid \n9 \n \nhad been an eye. I told him that neither of those things had been brought in \nwith him, and he was quiet for a long time. \nAfter the last ten minutes spent desperately wishing for another human being \nto talk to, I should have been relieved with Gerard’s company.

The storage room was not big and it took him \nbarely a second before he was in front of me, but it was the longest second I \nhave ever experienced as I tried to decide whether to risk my own life for that \nof the burned stranger blankly chanting his unsettling prayer. Behind Gerard I \nsaw bottles of saline solution start to bubble and boil. I stepped aside. He \nnodded in appreciation and said something that I remember very clearly, even \nthough it still makes no sense. He said, “Yes. For you, better beholding than the \nlightless flame”. \nI didn’t try to stop him as he walked back into the ward. I just stood there and \nwatched as he took out the scalpel, muttered some words I couldn’t make out, \nand plunged the blade into the centre of the chanting man’s throat.
