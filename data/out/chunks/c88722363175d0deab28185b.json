The Magnus Archives. Episode one hundred and eighty-\nfour: \"Like Ants.\" \n[Theme finishes] \n[Tape clicks on] \n[Hissing static] \n[Continuous sounds of a multitude of crawling, scuttling ants; \nsometimes passing by in enormous waves; their bites and squeaks \nuncomfortably close] \n[The sounds have a dull echo and dirt falls irregularly from the \nmovement] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 184 – Like Ants \n2 \nARCHIVIST \nThere are so many. They are beyond number. \n[Hissing static ends] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nThough one could pluck a numeral from the air and add some zeros, place a \nfigure on how many tiny, twitching things exist within these tunnels, it cannot \nbe comprehended. Not truly. The human mind can barely understand the true \nextent of a billion, and there are so many more than a billion of them. A \ntrillion. An octillion. A quindecillion. \nJust words and zeros; no connection to the true scale of what they are, how \nmuch they represent. They are past the place where numbers have meaning. \nHow many ants are there? Uncountable. \nThey shift and roil in dark and shining tides across the walls of the tunnels, \npock-marked in their turn by tiny earthen holes from which the things emerge, \nretreat and move as one. \n[Movements to get through the dirt and tunnels begin] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nAll around it may seem like solid earth that presses down and forces Jordan \nthrough on hands and knees, but it is not. He tries again to find somewhere to \nplace his hands, an inch or less of bare rock or undisturbed earth, but there is \nnothing. He does not know if this tunnel has the ants that bite, the ones that \nreek when they are crushed, or the ones so tough his weight does not destroy \nthem, and he can still feel them moving and squirming beneath his palm. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 184 – Like Ants \n3 \nJordan knows there is no way out. No twisting, squeezing passage that \npromises escape, that will allow him to emerge, screaming and encrusted with \nfilth and insect gore, to take a gasp of fresh and open air. But still he must push \non, press forward, keep moving. For he knows that when he stops, when he \npauses, when he finally succumbs to exhaustion and collapses, that is when \nthey descend upon him, subsume him beneath their impossible number. He \ncan try to keep them out, to cover his ears, close his mouth, squeeze his nose \nshut, close his eyes. But not forever. Eventually he can’t hold back the scream, \nbut it is muffled the moment his lips part to let it out. \nSo he keeps moving, scrabbling, pushing forward, clawing his way towards \nnothing but another few precious moments where he is not covered. For a \nmoment he hesitates at a crossroads, two tunnels before him, one large \nenough he need only stoop, the other narrow. He’d need to squeeze. And for a \nmoment Jordan’s sense of scale deserts him completely. Are these tunnels \nactually sized for him? Or has he himself been sized for this looping, intricate \ncolony? He shakes off such thoughts. The ants remain as small to him as ever, \nand as numerous. He chooses the tighter passage. \n[The dirt and tunnel movements continue, matching the statement] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nPressed so closely there can be fewer of them inside, and those that come for \nhim will be quickly crushed. Or so he hopes. And as he presses himself through \nthe jagged stone, it seems as if he has calculated correctly. The sharp scraping \nof rock is almost a relief after the tickling itch he has been enduring for so long, \nas they tear at his ragged clothes that never fully rip, and always leave crevices \nenough for ants to hide.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 0, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 3999}}
