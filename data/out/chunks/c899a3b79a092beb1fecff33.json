Well he’s not here at the moment so... I mean— Yeah, why don’t \nyou tell me what happened. \nBYSTANDER \nLook, it’s, uh... I don’t know.

Uh, so you… you’ve, you’ve got to understand my job, okay? I work for \nThames Water, uh, mainly pipes and stuff. Like, I mean, I mean, I’m a qualified \nengineer, but, you know, mostly it’s, it’s just manual stuff, like digging and \nreplacing pipe. Sometimes I’ve got to— You know, there are actual sewers \ninvolved. It’s not really where I saw myself ending up, you know, yeah, but who \ndoes? We don’t all get to build Formula One engines. Anyway, look, it’s fine. I \nactually get paid quite a bit more than the rest of the crew cos, you know, if \nthere’s— if there’s something that goes wrong or, or needs an engineer, here I \nam. Sorry. Uh, and the point is, uh, I do some work underground. Did some \nwork underground. \nLook, I know, I know, this doesn’t have anything to do with— Just— About five \nyears ago, we were doing some work under Kentish Town. It was pretty nasty. \nDo you know what a fatberg is? No, uh, it— Don’t worry. Don’t look it up, \nseriously. Don’t. You know it was just… It was a bad job. I had to spend a while \ndown there. Look, now I don’t know if there’s something with us and the work \nwe were doing or maybe just the brickwork wasn’t right anymore. Maybe it \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 142 – Scrutiny \n \n4 \n \nwas rotten or, or unstable or the place kind of— The place kind of collapsed on \nme. You know, just one moment I’m stood there torch in hand, and the next \nI’ve got a shooting pain all up my arm and I can feel god knows how much \nrubble on top of me and it’s absolutely pitch dark. I mean... yeah. \n(Nervous chuckles) I don’t need to tell you, look, I-I’d never been so scared. It \nwas like the world went away. Must have been a full five seconds I thought I \nwas dead. \nExcuse me. \nMARTIN \nIt’s alright. Just… take your time. \nBYSTANDER \nYeah... Yeah. \nWell, I don’t know how long I was down there. Well, well, I do, it was three \nhours, they told me. After. But it felt like... God, it felt like it could have been \nweeks. Never had a, a great sense of time and just— Gone. Everything, every \nbit of light or sound or, or anything that changed, that said time was passing. \nThere was nothing. Before that I never really thought about time, you know? \nBut now... Yeah. \nBut I was lying there, panicking, screaming, just trying to make any noise, any \nmovement that didn’t hurt like hell. And I... Okay. I felt something. No, I felt \nsomeone, grab my ankle. At first it was great, I had this, this huge wave of \nrelief, right? Someone had found me, they were getting me out.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 0, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 4021}}
