I have located a few stories about \nthe death of Lana Billings, found… strangled and partially skinned in the \nstorage of Fanton’s department store, but the rather lurid newspaper coverage \nis as much as I could find, and it gives no further information of use. \nWell, that’s not quite true. The Express illustrates their story with a picture of \nthe service entrance to Fanton’s, the entrance the killer is assumed to have \nused to access the storeroom. I do not know whether this picture was taken \nbefore or after the crime, or whether it’s a stock photo, but I cannot help but \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG083 – Drawing a Blank \n13 \n \nnotice, parked just at the edge, is an off-white delivery van. The resolution is \nnot high enough to make out the name on the side, but I’m not sure I need to. \nI’ve had little luck in tracking down Ms. Ashburt herself. I managed to find a \nlegal transcript from 2011 regarding a wrongful dismissal case she brought \nagainst a previous employer, the firing she claimed as being motivated by her \ndwarfism, but none of the parties involved had any up-to-date information on \nher. Something of a dead end. \nThere are some connections here, though what they might mean I… I just don’t \nknow. Circuses, skin, things just a few degrees off from human. The \nmannequin, I would assume, has some connection to this ‘Stranger’ being. The \nsame one we’ve… had such problems with already. \nBreekon and Hope… might also be connected to it. I recall they made a delivery \nto a taxidermy shop in a previous statement, I think, which brings us back to \nskin. Not to mention more than one witness has described them as… as \nuncanny, not quite seeming like real people. Until I am more certain of the \nidentities of the other powers out there, I am going to assume Breekon and \nHope are at least working with, if not part of, the Stranger. \nOf course, the biggest mystery to this statement is who sent it to me. And \nwhy? There’s no return address and, something I’m glad Georgie didn’t spot, \nno postmark. Which means it was delivered by hand. Does someone from the \nInstitute know where I am, or is it someone else? \nAnd why this statement? It links in with a lot of what I’m already looking into, \nbut if there are any revelations in it, I can’t find them. Or is it a warning? \nEmphasising that if I simply wait and see what happens, if I don’t act on what I \nknow, then someone I care about may pay the price. If that’s the case, then I \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG083 – Drawing a Blank \n14 \n \nthink… message received. Hiding won’t bring any answers, and it won’t stop \nwhatever’s going on. I’m going to keep looking into where this statement came \nfrom, but it wasn’t sent in vain. I’ve got work to do. \nRecording ends. \n[Tape clicks off] \n[The Magnus Archives Theme - Outro] \nThe Magnus Archives is a podcast distributed by Rusty Quill and licensed under \na creative commons attribution, non-commercial share alike 4.0 international \nlicense.
