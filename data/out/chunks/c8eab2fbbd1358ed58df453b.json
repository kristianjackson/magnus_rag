I will try to \nrestrain it. \nAre you familiar with the work of the poet William Hughes Mearns? I assume \nnot. Few people are, even now I’m not completely sure that’s how you \npronounce his name, having only ever seen it written down. There is one \npoem, however, I think you will be familiar with. It goes thus: \nAs I was going up the stair \nI met a man who wasn’t there! \nHe wasn’t there again today, \nOh how I wish he’d go away! \nWhen I came home last night at three, \nThe man was waiting there for me \nBut when I looked around the hall, \nI couldn’t see him there at all! \nGo away, go away, don’t you come back any more! \nGo away, go away, and please don’t slam the door… \nLast night I saw upon the stair, \nA little man who wasn’t there, \nHe wasn’t there again today \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG085 – Upon the Stair \n3 \n \nOh, how I wish he’d go away… \nIt’s called Antigonish, named after a town in Nova Scotia, home to the ghost of \nan old man who supposedly haunted the staircases of one of the grander \nhomes. For the longest time I misread the title, and was convinced the poem \nwas called ‘Antagonish’. I thought it was a rather clever play on the word \n‘antagonist’, owing to the ambiguous nature of the subject. \nI was disappointed, then, to discover it was simply a reference to a haunting. \nBy tying it to a real place and a known story, the strange, disconcerting \nnonsense at the heart of it was lost. Because nonsense is what it is. It is \nplayfully impossible. He cannot be not there. But he is. He was. And so am I. \nI didn’t meet him on the staircase as well. The carpet didn’t bend under the \nweight of his soft, round body, and I distinctly recall the absence of a creak as \nhis foot pressed on the loose board of the empty fifth step. He laughed, but \nthere was no humour it, because… then it would have had to break the silence. \nIn the poem, I had always imagined a translucent figure, absent in life and \nbody, but visible. But I couldn’t see this man. Obviously, I couldn’t. I couldn’t \nsee him or hear him or speak to him. Because… there was nobody there. The \nstaircase was empty, as he stretched his arm to gesture me closer. \nMy memory is not what it was. Some days it seems that damn poem is all I can \nremember. I know I had a family. I know I had a house. Was it in Antigonish? \nNo, that’s absurd. The man I didn’t meet had nothing to do with the poem, just \na, a coincidence. But I’m not sure… what else I know now; I’m not sure where \nelse I know now. And I’m unsure where I’ve ever been. I had a home. A house. \nI know it had at least two floors, because there were stairs. The stairs were \nreal. He wasn’t there, but the stairs were.
