ELLIOTT \nNo need to worry, I understand. Some things you just can’t trust to computers. \nIt’s like I always say about those robotic surgery machines. It’s just not the \nsame. If I’m going to be operating on a man’s pancreas, I want to feel that \npancreas. Fiddling with a joystick just won’t cut it. As it were. \n \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG034 – Anatomy Class \n2 \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nI didn’t think you still performed surgery? \n \nDR. ELLIOTT \nI keep up with the developments. And I remember the feel of a pancreas. \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nWell... quite. Now, if you’d be so good as to… \n \nDR. ELLIOTT \nYou know you have an infestation, don’t you? \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nExcuse me? I’m not sure… \n \nDR. ELLIOTT \nYes, little, grey, maggot things. I saw a few on the way in. Don’t recognise the \nspecies, but I’d say you need to get the exterminators in here. Gas the little \nblighters. \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG034 – Anatomy Class \n3 \n \nYou saw them? You weren’t bitten were you? \n \nDR. ELLIOTT \nBitten? They’re worms. Still, I’ll admit I didn’t like the look of them. I reckon \nthe sooner you get someone in to kill them dead, the better. \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nWe’ve tried, believe me. Now, shall we? \n \nDR. ELLIOTT \nOh, certainly. Where do want me to start? The bones? The blood? The... uh... \nthe fruit? \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nRight from the beginning. One second. \n \nDR. ELLIOTT \nStatement of Dr. Lionel Elliott, regarding a series of events that took place \nduring his class... \n \nDR. ELLIOTT \nIntroduction to Human Anatomy and Physiology \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG034 – Anatomy Class \n4 \n \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nAt King’s College, London, in early 2016. Statement recorded direct from \nsubject 12th July 2016. Statement begins. \n \nDR. ELLIOTT \nNow? \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nYes, just start from the beginning. \n \nDR. ELLIOTT \nRight. Well, I shouldn’t even have been teaching the class, really. As far as I \nknew, I wasn’t going to be needed for any teaching on the Biomedical \nEngineering course this year. I can’t say I was particularly upset. The Human \nAnatomy module is where a lot of the engineers discover just how messy the \nhuman body is, and while the human heart is a phenomenal piece of \nmachinery in terms of design and function, most of the students would be \nmore comfortable holding a transistor. Not to put too fine a point on it, I get \ntired of… squeamish students, and was glad that I could avoid it this year. \nYou can perhaps imagine, then, that I was not best pleased when Elena Bower, \nthe admissions officer, emailed me last November to say that there had been a \nmistake, and I was needed to take a ‘spillover class’.
