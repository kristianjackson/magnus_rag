We get called to a lot of bad drug trips, \nanimal attacks and folks with genuine mental health issues. Those are the ones \nthat have the potential to sound weirdest during initial contact. I didn't get \nanother genuine Section 31 case for… almost three years. \n \nJuly 18th 2014. I remember because it was the hottest day of the year, and the \nair con in the car was out, so we were really suffering. It was me and Alice \nTonner, who… everyone calls her “Daisy”, but I can never get her to tell me \nwhy. Anyway, Daisy was sectioned years before I was even on the force. She's \nnever been that forthcoming about any of her own experience; takes \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG043 – Section 31 \n8 \n \nSection 31 very seriously. The most I could get out of her was that she was \noriginally sectioned for something she referred to as “spider husks”. The way \nshe described it, it sounded like she’d found a bunch of shells, the sort crabs \nleave behind when they grow, but I could never figure out if it was meant to \nbe the husks of people-sized spiders, or the spider-like husks of people. And \nDaisy never seemed like she wanted to clarify. I'm sure she mentioned \nvampires once as well, but… I think she was joking. Probably. Maybe. \nAnyway, we were headed towards Kensington. This one had originally been \ncalled in for the ambulance, but then neighbours had reported gunshots, and \nwe had a very strange call with the paramedics. They had specifically refused \nto confirm there was a gun on the scene so we didn't send an armed unit. They \nwere still on standby, but something in the paramedics' report made \nthe other responders decide they should wait for us to get there. The building \nwas pretty run-down for Kensington. Still nicer than my house, but, you know. \nThe paramedics met us at the door and showed us up. The lift was out, so we \nheaded up the stairs. \n \nOn each floor I saw faces peering out of the cracks in front doors. They must \nhave been the neighbours who heard gunshots. We, we carried on up, [heavy \nexhalation] until we reached a door that was already open. The lights inside \nwere off; paramedics said they've all been smashed. \n \nThe windows had all been painted over, and it was like a boiler room in there. \nBut, even in the gloom, it was… it was clear there was a lot of blood around. A \nlot of blood. \n \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG043 – Section 31 \n9 \n \nWe found the ‘victim’ in the living room, sat on a large armchair. His face was a \nmess. We got a torch on him, and it was clear he'd been shot in the head \nmultiple times at close range. He was male, white, youngish. Age was hard to \nguess from what was left of his face. His clothes were new, and there were a \nlot of expensive-looking trinkets about the place. A lot of old-looking \ndomino sets in glass cases. \n \nDaisy spotted the gun lying next to him, and went over to retrieve it while I-I \nchecked the place for any other signs of life. I'd just turned around when I \nheard Daisy scream. The guy was moving, trying to gurgle something through \nwhat was left of his jaw. He was reaching for the gun. Daisy leapt for it, but it \nwas right next to him and she missed. The man who… he should have been a \ncorpse already… raised the gun, and pointed it into this… mass of flesh that \nwas his head. Daisy grabbed the gun before he could pull the trigger again, and \nmanaged to wrestle the gun away from him. Then he made a, he made a noise, \njust… just a really horrible sound. I think he was trying to cry. \n \nThe paramedics took him after that. They didn’t really want to, but it was \nclearly more in their domain than ours. I assume hospitals probably have their \nown version of a Section 31 those poor idiots had to sign later. Daisy and I told \nthem we’d clear it up on the police side. Just a standard suicide, and the body \nwas taken by the ambulance. It cut down on the forms, and neither of us \nwanted to sign another goddamn Section 31. \n \nARCHIVIST \nFascinating.
