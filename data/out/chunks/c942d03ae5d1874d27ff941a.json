You can’t see inside, \nremember? We have no idea what’s happening up there. \nARCHIVIST \nYou’re right, meaning we have no idea what he’s got planned for us. \nMARTIN \n(Frustrated) Yeah, but that was always going to be the case, wasn’t it? \n[Footsteps as the Archivist backs away] \nMARTIN (CONT’D) \nWait, where are you going? \nARCHIVIST \nWe shouldn’t have come. \n[Martin pulls the Archivist back] \nMARTIN \nA-oh, yeah, sure! We should just go with one of all those other options that we \nhave hidden up our sleeves, yeah? \nARCHIVIST \nMartin… \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 189 – Peers \n \n7 \nMARTIN \n(Growing angry) No, d-d-don’t “Martin” me, okay! We’re here, because it’s \nthis or nothing, right? \nARCHIVIST \nRight. \nMARTIN \nAnd we can’t do nothing, right? \nARCHIVIST \nRight. \nMARTIN \nGreat. So, lead on. \n(Annoyed exhale) \n…John? \nARCHIVIST \nOh. Um. \nMARTIN \nWhere’s the door. John? How do we get inside this monstrosity? \nARCHIVIST \nI, uh... Hm. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 189 – Peers \n \n8 \nMARTIN \nYou don’t know? \nARCHIVIST \nI’m, I’m not sure. \n(Exasperated sound from Martin) \nMARTIN \n(Whispered) Damn it. (normal) Something’s probably blocking you… \nARCHIVIST \nMaybe. Maybe The Eye doesn’t actually want me in there. Or, or it’s \nsomething Jonah Magnus put in place, or... ah. \nMARTIN \nOr? \nARCHIVIST \nOr… \n(The Archivist sighs) \nMARTIN \n(Sternly) Or? \nARCHIVIST \nOr maybe I can’t bring myself to look. Maybe I don’t actually want to go inside. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 189 – Peers \n \n9 \nMARTIN \n(Harshly) For god’s sake John! \nARCHIVIST \nI’m sorry! \nMARTIN \n(Suppressed anger) No it’s— \n(More calmy) I get it. It’s fine. Maybe there’s another way in? What’s this thing \nmade of anyway, like, like, obsidian or something, right? \nARCHIVIST \nOne-way mirrored glass. \nMARTIN \nOf course it is. Well, if it’s just glass, then it won’t be hard to break, right? We \ncan just grab something heavy, like one of these cameras, and then all I need... \nARCHIVIST \nOh, I wouldn’t. \n[Martin grabs and there is a fleshy, farty, yet pneumatic-like sound] \nMARTIN \nOh! Oh! Eurgh… \n(Martin gags) \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 189 – Peers \n \n10 \nARCHIVIST \n(Softly) Warned you. \nMARTIN \n(Raging) Brilliant! Just brilliant! \n[Thick glass is kicked twice, and a can in the firing zone rolls away] \nMARTIN (CONT’D) \nArgh! Damnit! \nARCHIVIST \n(Quietly) Martin… \nMARTIN \n(Sharp) What? \nARCHIVIST \nLook, just… just give me... Let me try to focus, tune out all these watchers. I-\nI’ve-I’ve got a statement to make anyway. \nMARTIN \nAlready? \nARCHIVIST \n(Tired) Yes. There’s a lot here, Martin. A lot. \nMARTIN \n(Harshly) Fine... fine. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 189 – Peers \n \n11 \n(Calmer) I’ll do a lap of the base. See if I can find any way in through any of the \nbits that used to be the Institute. \nARCHIVIST \nJust be careful, okay? \nMARTIN \nYeah, alright. Don’t worry about me. \nBesides if anything happens… least there’s plenty of witnesses. \nARCHIVIST \nThat’s not funny. \nMARTIN \nNo. \n(Martin sighs) \nBe back soon. \n[Brisk footsteps as Martin walks away] \n[two spotlights ka-chonk on] \nARCHIVIST \nRight, here’s your bloody performance... \n[Hissing static starts] \n[The Panopticon exterior is replaced with the urban sounds of a \ndistant car alarm, helicopters and traffic; camera iris movements \nare also heard]", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 1, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 3456}}
