Does she know if they’ve found the old prison yet, the panopticon, Eli— \n(hard edge) Magnus’s body. \nMARTIN \nI don’t know how hard they’re looking, to be honest? \nBasira says a few of them got lost in the tunnels for over a day— \n(The Archivist snickers) \n—and it’s not like the promise of an old man’s corpse is much of a motivator. \nARCHIVIST \nMm. \nMARTIN \nStill, she did manage to talk them out of burning the whole place to the \nground? Oh-ah! Actually, that reminds me, um… \n[Jostling sounds as Martin presents a package] \nARCHIVIST \nAh, these-these are the statements. \nMARTIN \nAh yes. Basira said last week she’d send some up as soon as the Archives \nweren’t a crime scene. \nARCHIVIST \nYes. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 160 – The Eye Opens \n \n8 \nMARTIN \nAh she wasn’t sure which ones you’d read already, so she, she just said she’d \nsend a bunch. \n[Cassette tapes pulled out and put down] \nARCHIVIST \nThere’s… tapes in here, as well. Did, did she say anything about tapes? \nMARTIN \nShe didn’t mention it? But I-I didn’t check it ‘til after the call. \nARCHIVIST \nMm. \nMARTIN \nI assume it’s her attempt at a- a, a varied diet? Eating your greens, you know? \nARCHIVIST \n(Amused) Probably. (reassured) I’m sure it’ll work fine. \nMARTIN \nCool. Well, as fun as listening to you monologue is… \nARCHIVIST \nHm. \nMARTIN \n…I will give you some privacy. Go for a walk. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 160 – The Eye Opens \n \n9 \nARCHIVIST \n(Warmly) Let me know if you see any good cows. \nMARTIN \nObviously I’m going to tell you if I see any good cows. \n[Martin heads out the room] \n(The Archivist chuckles quietly and fondly then sighs) \n[Small paper rustle] \nARCHIVIST \nRight. \n[The door shuts behind Martin] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \n(Pleasantly) Statement of Hazel Rutter regarding a fire in her childhood home. \nOriginal statement given August 9th, 1992. Audio recording by Jonathan Sims, \nThe Archivist. \nStatement begins. \n(Dark, lower) Hello, John. \n[Hissing static starts] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \n(Dark, lower tone continues) Apologies for the deception, but I rather wanted \nto make sure you started reading, so I thought it best not to announce myself. \nI’m assuming you’re alone; you always did prefer to read your statements in \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 160 – The Eye Opens \n \n10 \nprivate. (strained) I wouldn’t try too hard to stop reading; there’s every \nlikelihood you’ll just hurt yourself. So just listen. Now, shall we turn the page \nand try again? \n(The Archivist makes a pained sounds) \n[He turns the page] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nStatement of Jonah Magnus regarding Jonathan Sims, The Archivist. Statement \nbegins. \nI hope you’ll forgive me the self-indulgence, but I have worked so very hard for \nthis moment, a culmination of two centuries of work. \n[A storm begins, thunder echoes in the distance; every so often the \ncabin creaks; the fire continues] \n[Hissing static fades, but remains, faintly heard] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nIt’s rare that you get the chance to monologue through the voice of another, \nand you can’t tell me you’re not curious. Why does a man seek to destroy the \nworld? \nIt’s a simple enough answer: for immortality and power. Uninspired, perhaps, \nbut, my god. The discovery, not simply of the dark and horrible reality of the \nworld in which you live, but that you would quite willingly doom that world \nand confine the billions in it to an eternity of terror and suffering, all to ensure \nyour own happiness, to place yourself beyond pain and death and fear.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 1, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 3484}}
