Somewhere that there \nwas so little life that death could never find me. Empty, clear water, free of \nthose creeping tendrils. Of course, I had no way to get there. I’m not a rich \nman, and even if I was it’s not like I have any idea how to organise a sea \nvoyage. So for years it was just my little fantasy, my escape. Whenever it all got \ntoo much for me, and I woke up to those veins reaching along the wall towards \nmy neighbour’s apartment, I would go online and look at the photos people \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 121 – Far Away \n \n6 \n \nclaimed were taken at Point Nemo. I would revel in the thought that those \nclaims were probably lies, as there was a very good chance that no human \nbeing had ever actually reached the exact coordinates that promised me my \nescape. \nBut I couldn’t dream of it. I tried, of course. I spent every moment of lucidity I \nhad trying to guide myself far, far away from land, away from those horrid \ntubes that sat there, throbbing doom out into the world. But each time I \nstarted to get away from them, whenever I felt I might have reached a point \nwhere I couldn’t see any more of them, I would start to feel this tugging on my \nleg, like something was wrapped around it and starting to gently squeeze. \nSomething that pulsed very softly. I never quite had the courage to actually \nlook at it. I’d always just turn around and start moving back towards a city. And \nit would let me go. I never even got over the Channel in my dreams, let alone \nall the way to the South Pacific. \nSo, you can maybe imagine how I felt when I found an article, tucked in the \nmargins of a regional paper, talking about an upcoming expedition to sail a \nresearch vessel down to Point Nemo. The piece didn’t go into much detail \nabout what they were trying to do – something about measuring the amount \nof plastic and chemicals in the water, seeing how much impact humans had \nhad on the environment at its most extreme point. I don’t know; I’m not a \nscientist. And I’m not a sailor, either. There was no legitimate way I was ever \ngoing to make it onto that ship. \nBut none of that mattered. I had to do it. I hadn’t been sleeping much, I \nsuppose, and I had it lodged into my mind that if I could just get there, to Point \nNemo, if I could just… If I could be far enough away from mortality and people \nand land, then I could rest. I could finally have a dreamless sleep. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 121 – Far Away \n \n7 \n \nSo, I did some digging, found the identity of a few crew members, and started \nto track them down. I told myself I didn’t know what I was looking for, but I \ndid. Of course I did. And I finally saw them, following along behind Dr Thomas \nPritchard. He was a younger guy, some sort of chemist, and he had a habit of \ndriving his motorcycle a bit too recklessly. When I saw him that first time, the \nveins were tumbling out from the open visor of his bike helmet and coiling \nthemselves around his throat so tightly that it almost seemed like his head \nwasn't attached to the rest of him. Of course, after he went flying over the \nbarrier at 95 miles an hour... well, that’s neither here nor there. \nIt was three in the morning and the motorway was silent except for me and \nthe mangled remains of Dr Thomas Pritchard. I knew exactly what I had to do. \nHe didn’t look anything like me, not really, but that didn’t matter. All that \nmattered was my desperation to finally have a good night’s sleep. I looked at \nhis body, but all I could think of was the gentle rocking of lifeless waves. So, I \ntook his ID and his keys, then I touched my very first corpse, as I loaded what \nwas left of him and his motorcycle into my van and buried them in a well-\nhidden spot near Epping Forest. It’s strange after all that; I don't actually \nremember how I felt. Heavy, I think. But I had other concerns. It was a daft \nplan. It shouldn’t have worked. Someone should have driven past while I was \nmoving them. Someone should’ve seen me. But they didn’t. \nWith his keys, I let myself into Dr Pritchard’s flat and gathered as much \ninformation on the expedition as I could. It wasn’t a lot, not that I could really \nunderstand, and I just had to hope it was enough to pass myself off. Even if it \nwas only long enough to get one good night's sleep. \nAs it turned out, I need", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 3, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 4500}}
