I’d have thought the thing would at least try to break free while I did \nit, but… thank heaven for small mercies, I suppose. \nA huge block of solid concrete. What ought to do with it? Some sort of \nengraving, maybe? “In memory of Toby”? I can’t very well put it up “In \nmemory of Angus”. That’s what really gets me, to be honest. Those pigs didn’t \ndeserve what that thing did to them. Tearing them apart and eating them. \nNeither did Angus, of course. The circus is still around if you want to talk to \n\nthem, but the search for Angus Dale is still going on, so I’d appreciate it if you \ndidn’t bring my name up. Oh, and if you’re hungry, I’ve got some bacon in the \nfreezer I’m going to cook up. \nWhat? \nStatement ends. \nARCHIVIST \nAnother dead end for Gertrude, it seems. Assuming it was Gertrude Mr. \nAnderson was talking to, but I feel that’s a safe assumption as the tickets to \nWellington were only for one. Perhaps Gerard joined her later? I can only \nimagine her frustration upon chasing down a mysterious disappearance with a \ncircus connection, only to find herself instead trying to help contain an evil pig. \nToo much meat. \nThe disappearance of Angus Dale is still an open case though, no leads have \nbeen found since a possible reported sighting in 2016 that didn’t amount to \nanything. Martin attempted to make contact with Mr. Anderson himself, but \nafter a few unanswered emails and calls ringing out, I think we can safely \nabandon that hope. \nThere is one loose end I’m hoping might amount to something though. Mr. \nAnderson mentioned his brother, Kurt, emigrated to the UK, and works as a \ntraffic warden. At least, as of 2014. Melanie’s seeing if she can hunt him down. \nIf he’s still around, there’s a possibility he might be able to fill in a few of the… \nmissing pieces. I currently have nothing to indicate where Gertrude might have \ntravelled next, but I... I have a hunch Kurt Anderson might be able to help. \n[Tape clicks off. Tape clicks on. There is the noise of a street.] \n\nARCHIVIST \nEr, excuse me, are you Kurt Anderson? \nKURT \nYeah, why? \nARCHIVIST \nDylan Anderson is your… is your brother? \nKURT \nYeah... Why is he in some kind of trouble? \nARCHIVIST \nOh no, I-I-I want to… I just have a couple of questions. \nKURT \nLook buddy, I’m not sure about— \nARCHIVIST \nIt’s about a pig he owned back in 2014. \nKURT \nWoah. No, I don’t know anything about that. \nARCHIVIST \nWell, it’s kind of a weird one— No, look, I know we haven’t met… \nKURT \n\nI don’t know what you’re talking about. \nARCHIVIST \n(Sighs) Fine… What do you know about the pig? \nKURT \nI only met it once, and it freaked me right out. I haven’t been back since. But \nDylan says he managed to get rid of it. \nARCHIVIST \nDid he mention an old woman who helped him? \nKURT \nYeah, but he didn’t say how. Told me some weird guy turned up afterwards, \nand she went off with him in a real hurry. Left heaps of stuff behind and all. \nARCHIVIST \nEr, w-w-what, what stuff did she leave behind? \nKURT \nI don’t know, papers, letters, a couple of old plane tickets. Now listen, dude ... \nARCHIVIST \nNo, no, did he say what he did with them? \nKURT \nHe sent them to me, asked me to get them back to her. \n\nARCHIVIST \nA-And did you? \nKURT \nNo, couldn’t be bothered. Then I forgot. I’ve still got them somewhere, I think. \nARCHIVIST \nI, um, I, I work with her. Could I ... could I collect them? \nKURT \nNo! I don’t know even know you! Just get away, dude. Weirdo. Leave me \nalone. \nARCHIVIST \nB-B-B-But those papers are very important. \nKURT \nGet away from me. \nARCHIVIST \nFine, fine, just... What’s your darkest secret? \nKURT \nI don’t know. Er, sometimes I take little bribes, and not give people a ticket. \nOh, what the hell? \nARCHIVIST", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 4, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 3908}}
