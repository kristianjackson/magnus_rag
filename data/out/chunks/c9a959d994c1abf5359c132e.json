Episode one hundred and thirty-\ntwo. Entombed. \n[The tape clicks on. A second tape clicks on.] \nDAISY (TAPE) \nIt was a coffin. An old, wooden coffin. Rough, unvarnished. I could see splinters \nwhere the nails had been hammered in badly. Wrapped all around it was a \nthick metal chain, ending in a heavy padlock. That weird moaning was coming \nfrom inside it. It was the only sound that cut through pounding rain. \n[The tape clicks off. The tape is replaced. The new tape clicks on.] \nARCHIVIST \n(Sighs) Hello, Melanie. I know I said we’d wait until Basira was back, but I \ndon’t... I’m sorry. I know she won’t... She’d want to do it a different way. But I \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 132 – Entombed \n \n2 \n \nknow what I’m doing. This time I do. I hope. I have her voice. I think that \nshould be enough to find her, and I’m leaving my... I’ll leave it with the tape. I \nshould be able to find my way back to it. I think. Wish me luck. Although, I \nsuppose if you’re hearing this, then I didn’t have any. I don’t know. I’m... I’m \nscared. When does the fear go away? Anyway, I’m sorry. You too, Basira, if \nyou’re hearing this. I know you’d stop me. You’d be right to, but … But if this \ngoes wrong, all you lose is … I’m not risking anyone else. And I know… I think I \ncan get her out. \n[The Archivist turns the tape off.] \nARCHIVIST \nRight, you’re coming with me. Let’s do this one properly. \n[Static rises] \nNo need for that. I’m willing. \n[Static fades] \nRight. \n[Sound of archivist opening the casket and chains rattling] \nARCHIVIST (Cont.) \nStone steps. Roughly hewn. They... They keep going. (Sighs) Well, no point \nwaiting. \n[The Archivist descends the steps, a door shuts, then the archivist continues \ndownwards. The tape clicks off. The tape clicks on.] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 132 – Entombed \n \n3 \n \nARCHIVIST \nI’m not sure how long it’s been. The steps ended, eventually. There’re \npassages, but it’s very … It’s close. I’m having some trouble, but I’m going the \nright way. I know it. I just … I just need to keep moving. When I stop, it starts to \npress on me. Just keep going. \n[Tape clicks off. Tape clicks on. There are sounds of scraping against stone \nand earth as he moves.] \nARCHIVIST \nI-I can’t stand, anymore. It’s not a passage, not anymore. It’s a tunnel, barely \nthat. But I’m … I’m definitely getting closer. If I can just ... \n[The Archivist struggles forward] \nARCHIVIST \nMy torch is broken. I didn’t even drop it. It got caught against the wall. \nCrushed. God. I don’t even know how long I’ve been here. \n[The tape clicks off. The tape clicks on. The Archivist is still moving. It sounds \nslow and difficult.] \nARCHIVIST \nI heard someone. He was begging for me to save him. He said he couldn’t \nbreathe. I can barely breathe. I couldn’t find him, but I am not here for him. I \ndon’t even know him. I can’t … I can’t see anything here. For all this place \ncloses around me, I feel adrift, like nothing can get through the dirt and the \nmuck and ... I still have Daisy’s tape, and I still think I’m going the right way, \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 132 – Entombed \n \n4 \n \nwhen I move at all. It feels like every inch costs me another scrape or bruise. I’d \nhoped I was beyond that, but apparently not. \n(Struggling to breath) The air is heavy – soil and dust. I am very thirsty, but I \nknow I won’t die of it. I won’t die of anything down here. Not ever. Not if I \ncan't find my way out. When I first came down, I could feel it, the part of \nmyself I left outside, but ... But it’s been getting fainter, and now … I’ll try not \nto think about it. I don’t … don’t want to stretch my mind to try and see it, in \ncase it’s not there at all. I can’t afford to think about it. Not now. \n[The tape clicks off. The tape clicks on.] \nARCHIVIST \n(Strained) I think ... Oh God … I think I’m … I’m stuck. \n[The tape clicks off. The tape clicks on. The Archivist struggles to free himself. \nIn the distance there’s a thunderclap.] \nARCHIVIST \nWh-what? \n[Heavy rain sounds in the distance, and singing starts to pass through the \nearth] \nARCHIVIST \nOh no. No … \n[He struggles to breath as the Buried squeezes him. The Buried relaxes.] \n(The Archivist takes a breath.)", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 0, "chunk_count": 4, "chars": 4433}}
