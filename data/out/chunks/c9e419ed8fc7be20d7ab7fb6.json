I don't know why or what about \nand no one here seems to be able or willing to help me find out, but he was \nhere. I'm not going to rest until I find out why. Not that I could rest anyway. \nThose eyes still haunt my dreams and follow me through the waking world. \nEven here. Especially here. \nARCHIVIST \nStatement ends. \nA bit of an odd one, this. The mid-late 20th century seems marginally better \nfiled than most of the archives, so we haven't seen as many rogue statements \ncropping up from that period. Most of the details from Ms Myer's statement \nseem to check out. Sasha got a confirmation from the BBC that she had indeed \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 060 – Observer Effect \n \n10 \n \nbeen one of the anchors for the 'Look East' evening news between 1970 and \n'72, until she suffered a nervous breakdown and damaged several cameras in \ntheir Norwich studio. \nMartin's checking with the University of Southampton also seems to confirm \nthe details of Christopher Myer's life and death. I even tried to read one or two \nof his books, but they were a bit dry even for me and didn't appear to have any \nparticular relevance to the case. I've been unable to locate any evidence that \nhe made use of the Institute's library or consultation services, but even these \ndays those records aren't kept in as much detail as they really should be, so \nthat doesn't necessarily mean he wasn't here. \nWhat's most interesting is what Tim found out about the final two decades of \nMs Myer's life, before she died in prison in 1993. Following this statement, she \napparently spent almost 12 years working low level service jobs until both her \nmother and father passed away (of cancer and heart disease respectively). \nThere's nothing notable about this period in any official records, but on \nOctober 24th, 1984, she murdered a delivery van driver named Danilo Kostic. \nShe unloaded the van's normal cargo of filing paper and envelopes, before \nfilling it with several barrels of petrol. She was apprehended just south of \nVauxhall bridge after she jumped a red light and collided with another car. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 060 – Observer Effect \n \n11 \n \nLuckily, the petrol did not ignite, and she was picked up by police as she tried \nto flee the scene. \nOriginally charged with reckless driving, it didn't take long for them to connect \nher to the murder of Mr Kostic, and she was given a sentence of 17 years in \nHMP Holloway. She died of pneumonia nine years later. A bizarre and \napparently motiveless crime. The one detail that still nags at me is that the \ncompany that Danilo Kostic worked for, Paper Run Limited, is the same \ncompany that, at the time, supplied most of the stationary to the Magnus \nInstitute. I have a nasty feeling about exactly where she was taking that petrol. \nEnd recording. \n[Tape clicks off. Tape clicks on.] \nARCHIVIST \nYou don't mind if I record this, I trust? \nELIAS \nWell, to be honest– \nTIM \nThat's kind of one of the things that we wanted to talk about. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 060 – Observer Effect \n \n12 \n \nMARTIN \nThis is an intervention. \n[The Archivist stands up] \nARCHIVIST \nExcuse me. \nELIAS \nIf you'd rather it was an official disciplinary hearing, John, we can arrange it. \nARCHIVIST \nFine, say your piece. \nNOT!SASHA \nWe care about you, John. And you've been rather erratic since the Prentiss \nincident. \nMARTIN \nAnd we’d, we’d really like– \nELIAS \nTo not have to fire you. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 060 – Observer Effect \n \n13 \n \nMARTIN \nTo make sure that you're doing okay. \nARCHIVIST \nLook, I understand I've been a bit distant recently. \nTIM \nYou were watching my house. \nNOT!SASHA \nYou followed me on my lunch break and searched my desk. \nMARTIN \nYou said I was lying about a murder! \nARCHIVIST \nI, uh, uh, that is to say, I– \nNOT!SASHA \nYou think we killed Gertrude. \nARCHIVIST \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 060 – Observer Effect \n \n14 \n \nNo. It's... I... maybe. Maybe you did. I don't know. \nELIAS \nJohn, this is absurd. This goes far beyond an unhealthy work environment. I'll \nadmit it's partly my fault for letting it get this bad. I, I should have stepped in \nearlier. \nTIM \nYou still don't believe us, do you? \nARCHIVIST \nIt's not that I don't believe you, it's just... I mean, you could have done it. \nTIM \nSeriously? Listen to yourself. \nMARTIN \nIt's not right!", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 4, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 4410}}
