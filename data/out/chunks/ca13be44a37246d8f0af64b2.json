They sit oh-so-very still and keep their hands held tight to their \nchest. \nFRANCIS: No. Not this time. I won't. \n[The audience laughs] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nPause for laughter. \n[Laughter ends] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nFrancis looks up at The Spider, so close now the thick drippings of its jaws fall \nonto their shoulders in a sticky stream. It says nothing— \n[The sound of whipping rope that ends with stabbing flesh] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \n—but a hook leaps from the darkness backstage, fastening itself into the soft \nskin on the back of Francis’ free hand. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 172 – Strung Out \n13 \nFRANCIS, offstage: You don't get it, like, it's my decision. I know what I'm \ndoing; just— can we stop talking about it, please? It's fine, i-it just… just helps. \nIt helps. \nFrancis’ whole body shudders at the sound of their own voice, as the hook \npulls their arm forward, across the table. \nFRANCIS: No. No! \nTheir hand closes on the bottle, which shifts and chitters with delight as \nFrancis, shaking, brings it close. \n[Rope creaks] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nTHE SPIDER's legs twitch and jerk as it shifts the doomed marionette's strings. \nFRANCIS watches as their hand gently uncorks the bottle, and the first of the \ntiny crawling spiders begins to emerge — just as their mouth is yanked open by \nits hook and their arm upends the bottle. \n[Cork popping sound, followed by sounds of many crawling spiders] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nAs FRANCIS feels the cascade crawl over their tongue and down their throat, \nthey wonder just for a moment, whether this is better or worse than when \nthey scuttle up through their veins, or down into their lungs. \nIt is an impossible question, and quite, quite pointless. \n[Crawling spiders, chitinous laughing, followed by unpleasant low \nrupture sound and more crawling spiders] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 172 – Strung Out \n14 \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nAbove them, their tormentor cries out in exaltation as its abdomen ruptures, \nand the spiders within are joined by a rain of countless, tiny legs from above, \ncovering them, embracing them. Drowning them. \nThere is no unconsciousness here, no calm detachment or serene buzz. There \nis only the arachnids. Biting. Scurrying. Consuming. \nAnd so it will be until the curtain descends at last and The Spider resets the \nscene, its belly already beginning to swell once again with replacements for the \ncreatures it so gorily birthed. \n[The audience laughs] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nPause for laughter. \n[The laughter transitions into end-of-show clapping with some \nhollers from the crowd] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nAnd so the curtain descends. \n[The clapping ends and the audience settle again] \n[Hissing static starts] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nThe tragedy of Francis. A comic puppet show in all acts. Act forty-eight \nthousand and sixty-eight— \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 172 – Strung Out \n15 \nMARTIN \n(Faint and muffled) John? \nARCHIVIST \n—A stage that is a room that remains a stage. \nMARTIN \n(Faint and muffled) One is enough. \nARCHIVIST \nThe audience— \n[Martin slaps him] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nI, oh, wh-what? \n[Hissing static ends] \n[The audience waiting sounds are gone; now the sound of audience \nlaughter from behind walls comes regularly from different \ndirections] \nMARTIN \nSorry. You were starting another, and I didn't want to wait. We should get \ngoing. \nARCHIVIST \nYou-you were listening, I-I, I, I thought that— \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 172 – Strung Out \n16 \nMARTIN \nNo, I— Not for most of it. I just thought I heard… something. Whatever. I went \nexploring, alright? I don't know why; I shouldn't have. \nARCHIVIST \nNo, you-you shouldn't have! \nMARTIN \nYou know how many stages there are in this place, how many, little theatres? \nARCHIVIST \nYes. Yes I do. \nMARTIN \nRight, stupid question. \nARCHIVIST \nMartin… \nMARTIN \nWell, let's just say they have a full bill, alright? \n[In the background, an announcer makes a show-starting \nannouncement] \nARCHIVIST \nMartin.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 4, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 4094}}
