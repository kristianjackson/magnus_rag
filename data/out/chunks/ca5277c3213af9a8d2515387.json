And then there was that picture of an empty sky. I’ve never had any \nfear of heights, but staring at that picture I felt… I don’t know, really. I just \ncouldn’t look at it for too long. It seemed to open forever, nothing to do but \nfall into it. It was even stranger as there wasn’t much to the picture itself \nexcept for black ink and a few stylised stars, but something in the proportions \njust had that effect on me. \nI decided that maybe Katherine had been right, and it might be valuable as an \nantique, so I did some research to try and find out more about it. Latin fell out \nof favour as a language for academic texts in the 18th Century and I really \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG004 – Page Turner \n6 \n \ndoubted the thing was that old. Since then it was only really used for religious \ntexts but the book certainly didn’t look like it was full of prayers. \nSearching Ex Altiora online didn’t do much good – the phrase was used in a few \nold prayers, there was a company called Altiora and something in Italian about \nfootball, but nothing that looked even remotely like it related to my book. \nSearching for Jurgen Leitner wasn’t much better. \nIt brought up an entry for an Austrian musician and a few Facebook pages, \nalthough they all seemed to have umlauts in their names, unlike the one in the \nbook, and none of them looked like the sorts to have a library full of strange \nLatin texts. The only thing I found that looked even remotely relevant was a \nlisting on eBay from 2007. The auction was titled “Key of Solomon 1863 owned \nby MacGregor Mathers and Jurgen Leitner” and had been won for just over \n£1200 by a deactivated user – grbookworm1818. There was no picture or \ndescription – just the title and the winning bid. I decided to call it a night and \ngo to bed. I think I had a nightmare but I don’t \nremember the details. \nI slept in very late the next day and by the time I awoke there wasn’t much \ndaylight left, but I spent the hours until my show contacting book dealers that \nI’d looked up online. All of them put the book’s age between 100 and 150 \nyears, and said it looked like it had been custom-bound. \nMost offered to buy it off me for a few hundred pounds, but at this point I was \nmore interested in information about it. Unfortunately, none of them had \nheard of it before, or seemed at all familiar with its contents. The last seller I \nwent to did recognise the name Jurgen Leitner, though. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG004 – Page Turner \n7 \n \nShe told me Leitner had been a big name in the literary scene during the \n1990s; some rich Scandinavian recluse paying absurd amounts of money for \nwhatever books took his fancy. It was said he’d often have books custom-\nbound after providing a manuscript, or even commission authors to produce \nworks to his brief - although she didn’t actually know any writers who had \nworked with Leitner. He dropped from public view sometime around ’95, but \nshe recalled he used to have extensive dealings with Pinhole Books down in \nMorden, and gave me the details for Mary Keay, who owned it. \nI went and I did my show after that, the last night of the run, in point of fact, \nbut though I didn’t miss a single lighting cue, all through it I just couldn’t take \nmy mind off the book. I felt as though there was something I was missing, just \nbeyond my grasp. And all throughout I could detect that same faint smell of \nozone. Or was it ozone? There was something else there, something I knew but \ncould not remember. Every time I felt I was close, I was overcome with a \ndizziness and nausea that threatened to topple me over. \nI skipped the cast party afterwards, instead going for a long walk to “clear my \nhead” in the cold November air. I don’t know how long I walked for. It must \nhave been hours, but it felt right, like \nit was all I could do. Walking felt as natural as falling. It was only when a man \nshouted at me for \nalmost walking into him that I stopped and took stock of my surroundings. I \nhad no idea where I was. I took out my phone to find the nearest station and \nsaw that I was only a street away from Morden. I felt dizzy all of a sudden, and \nwhen I looked at the building I was stood in front of, I was not in the least bit", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 3, "chunk_count": 10, "chars": 4257}}
