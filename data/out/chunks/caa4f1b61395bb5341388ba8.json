All told, I feel I more than earned my bacon. \nI still remember the first time Benjamin saw skulls near our campsite, those \ntravellers before us who had not fared as well as we had. Poor man almost \nfainted and I could not help but reflect that, were it not for me, he would likely \nhave joined those poor departed souls. I decided not to share that particular \nreflection. \nWe reached the Laramie River and Fort John in October. It was a squalid little \nfur trading post in Wyoming, with thick wooden walls that were solid enough \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 058 – Trail Rations \n \n6 \n \nto keep out any war-minded natives, and there were all the signs that a great \nmany people had recently passed through the place. The manager, an officious \nman, who introduced himself as Bruce, told us that we had missed the chance \nto safely cross the Rockies and that the passes would be snowed up within the \nmonth. He said we could winter at Fort John if we had the food and money for \nit, or we could turn around and leave. From his tone of voice, it sounded like \nhe had not much care for which of the options we chose. We were, of course, \ndevastated, and spent several days discussing our options and trying to make a \ndecision as to the wisest course of action, though we knew that for every hour \nwe spent in such conference, our choices became fewer and the consequences \nsharper. \nIt was at that point we were approached by a man who introduced himself as \nEustace Wick. He was a short, squat figure, broad of shoulder and with the \nrough, dark skin of one who has spent most of his life under the sun’s \nunforgiving glare. His long, shaggy beard was shot through with grey, but his \neyes sparkled with a cunning and intelligence I would not have expected to see \nfrom such an unkempt face. He also possessed one other attribute which \nsurprised me, though in hindsight it takes on a somewhat sinister light; he had \nin his mouth a full and healthy set of teeth. \n \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 058 – Trail Rations \n \n7 \n \nNow Mr Eustace Wick enquired as to our purpose in Fort John and, speaking \nfar more candidly than I was truly comfortable with, Benjamin explained to \nhim our journey and our dilemma. At the mention of the words ‘Willamette \nValley’, the short man’s eyes lit up and a smile practically split his face in two, \nfor he was, so he said, the best guide since Sacagawea and could get us \nthrough the Rockies long before the snows hit with any force. For a price. \nWhen he said this, he smiled, and all the square and shining teeth in his mouth \nseemed to catch the light. \nI was hesitant, as I had met plenty of hucksters and bandits who were keen to \npass themselves off as guides and, as Benjamin haggled the price, my \nmisgivings grew, for Eustace Wick seemed to offer little in the way of \nresistance and we secured his services for only $20. Plenty of money, to be \nsure, but for the services he was offering, and the dangers involved, it was \npractically nothing. \nUnfortunately, for all my consternation, it soon became clear that Benjamin \nhad made up his mind to hire the man. To be fair to him, we did not have the \nresources to winter in Fort John and were we to try and make our way back, \nthere was every possibility the weather would still turn deadly on us. We were \ncaught between the devil and the sea and Benjamin had determined that,", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 2, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 3544}}
