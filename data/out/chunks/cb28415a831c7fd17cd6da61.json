Now listen, dude ... \nARCHIVIST \nNo, no, did he say what he did with them? \nKURT \nHe sent them to me, asked me to get them back to her. \n\nARCHIVIST \nA-And did you? \nKURT \nNo, couldn’t be bothered. Then I forgot. I’ve still got them somewhere, I think. \nARCHIVIST \nI, um, I, I work with her. Could I ... could I collect them? \nKURT \nNo! I don’t know even know you! Just get away, dude. Weirdo. Leave me \nalone. \nARCHIVIST \nB-B-B-But those papers are very important. \nKURT \nGet away from me. \nARCHIVIST \nFine, fine, just... What’s your darkest secret? \nKURT \nI don’t know. Er, sometimes I take little bribes, and not give people a ticket. \nOh, what the hell? \nARCHIVIST \n\nRight, okay, I imagine Lambeth Borough Council would be very interested to \nknow that, and I have it on tape. So… let’s go get those papers, shall we? \nKURT \n(Scared) What are you?! \nARCHIVIST \nLet’s go. \n[Tape clicks off. Tape clicks on. The sounds of the tunnels – the voices in the \nfollowing conversation echo.] \nARCHIVIST \nThank you for coming. \nDAISY \nSure. Why down here? \nARCHIVIST \nI, um, E-Elias, I-I think… I think he has a hard time seeing things down here. \nDAISY \nI.e. he’s not watching? \nARCHIVIST \nMaybe? I’m, I’m pretty sure it takes him actual effort so ... and it’s Wednesday \nafternoon, when he does his scheduling. So I’m hoping he’s distracted. He, er \n... he loves scheduling. \n\nDAISY \nRight. So, if he’s not paying attention, and I kill you down here ... \nARCHIVIST \nI mean, I wouldn’t… I wouldn’t risk it. \nDAISY \nHm. \nARCHIVIST \nLook, I’m… I’m going away for a while. The, the things I’m, I’m looking for \nthey’re… they’re not in England, not in the UK, I don’t think. So I... I just wanted \nto, to ask, make sure you were going to look after the others. \nDAISY \nThat’s my job. Now. Apparently. \nARCHIVIST \nI-I-I I don’t just mean Basira. E-Elias... \nDAISY \nI’ll keep an eye on them. That all? \nARCHIVIST \nNo. No. I was, I was… I was thinking. This… Section 31 unit that, that you’re a \npart of— \nDAISY \n\nNot a unit! Just paperwork. \nARCHIVIST \nRight but, but... what do they think about Elias? \nDAISY \nBest avoided. Pretty harmless. Um, crimes involving the Institute get people \nsectioned, but he’s not an active threat. \nARCHIVIST \nIf we had evidence that he was an active threat, that he was killing people, he, \nhe was the one threatening to make all of your stuff public, do you think they’d \nmove against him? \nDAISY \nMaybe. \nARCHIVIST \nI mean, he’s got knowledge, but I-I don’t know how much that would help in— \nWhat? \nDAISY \nYou sure you want to talk with that thing running? \nARCHIVIST \nOh. Um, I-I… I didn’t ... didn’t realise I’d turned it on. \nDAISY \n\nHuh. We don’t know how he’s watching. No evidence. \nARCHIVIST \nR-Right. \n[Tape clicks off.] \n[The Magnus Archives Theme – Outro] \nJONATHAN SIMS \nThe Magnus Archives is a podcast distributed by Rusty Quill and licenced under \na Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Sharealike 4.0 International \nLicense.
