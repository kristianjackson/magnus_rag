Honestly, Detective Tonner has been proving \ninvaluable through this whole process. I was racking my brains for months \nabout what I could use to lure you in. And, of course, I knew the Dark Sun was \njust sitting there waiting. So when it came time, I whipped up another \napocalypse and sent you on your merry way. \nThen all that remained was the Lonely. Poor Peter. He really should have left \nwell enough alone. (cruel laugh) Or just done what I asked in the first place. Ah \nwell. He knew what I was attempting and was very unwilling to cooperate until \nI made him a little wager about Martin. Of course, he had no way of knowing \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 160 – The Eye Opens \n \n18 \nthat, in addition to setting you up for the final mark, he was giving you all the \ntools you needed to escape from it. \nHow is Martin, by the way? He looks well. You will keep an eye on him when all \nthis is over, won’t you? He’s earned that. And there, I think, we are brought \njust about up to date. I have enjoyed our little trip down memory lane, but \npast here lies only impatience. \nYou are prepared. You are ready. You are marked. The power of the Ceaseless \nWatcher flows through you, and the time of our victory is here. Don’t worry, \nJohn. You’ll get used to it here, in the world that we have made. \nNow. (cruel laugh) Repeat after me. \n[As the Archivist begins to read the incantation there is the rising \nsounds of: the storm intensifying, building creaks, hissing static, \nwhispered chanting, and rumbling] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nYou who watch and know and understand none. \nYou who listen and hear and will not comprehend. \nYou who wait and wait and drink in all that is not yours by right. \nCome to us in your wholeness. \nCome to us in your perfection. \nBring all that is fear and all that is terror and all that is the awful dread that \ncrawls and chokes and blinds and falls and twists and leaves and hides and \nweaves and burns and hunts and rips and bleeds and dies! \nCome to us. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 160 – The Eye Opens \n \n19 \nI \nOPEN \nTHE \nDOOR! \n[An explosive sound of breaking glass] \n[The rising sounds keep intensifying; the tape glitches] \n[Tape clicks off] \n[Tape clicks on] \n[Hissing static is joined by swirling wind and distorting, warping \nnoises from unknown sources] \nMARTIN \n(Frantic) Wake up. Wake up. Wait, John, John, John, WAKE UP! \n[He slaps the Archivist, who shudders awake with a \ndisoriented yell] \nARCHIVIST \n(Dazed) Uh- Wh- Martin? \nMARTIN \nJohn! \nARCHIVIST \nWha- wh- (more lucid) Oh god. What happened? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 160 – The Eye Opens \n \n20 \nMARTIN \nI, I don’t, I don’t know; everything— (upset) It’s all gone wrong! \nARCHIVIST \nHelp me up! \n[The Archivist grunts as Martin helps him up] \nMARTIN \nNo, no, no- don’t, don’t, don’t go outside. It’s- It’s real bad. \n[The Archivist staggers to the door] \n(Beat) \nARCHIVIST \n(Realisation breaking him) Oh god. \nMARTIN \nI don’t know if it’s just here, or… \n(Martin takes terrified breaths as the Archivist speaks) \nARCHIVIST \nNo. No, it’s everywhere. They’re all here now. (voice shaking) I can feel… all of \nit. \nMARTIN \nJohn. John, I’m scared. \n(Martin takes terrified breaths as the Archivist speaks) \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 160 – The Eye Opens \n \n21 \nARCHIVIST \nThe whole world is afraid, Martin. Because of me. \nAnd The Watcher, drinks it all in. \nMARTIN \n(Quietly) John? \nARCHIVIST \nLook at the sky, Martin. Look at the sky. \nIt’s looking back. \n(The Archivist begins a fractured, delirious, humourless, laugh that does not \nend) \n[Tape clicks off] \n[The Magnus Archives Theme - Outro] \nALEXANDER J NEWALL \nThe Magnus Archives will return April, 2020. \nJONATHAN SIMS \nThe Magnus Archives is a podcast distributed by Rusty Quill and licensed under \na Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial ShareAlike 4.0 International \nlicence.
