Now he and his crew were pinning the things that looked like men to \ntrees with long iron spikes. They thrashed and struggled, and a long, bulbous \ntongue hung from their throats, pinned by the iron of Von Toll’s men. “I cannot \nstand bloodsuckers,” Raleigh said approvingly, as he conversed quietly with \nBaron Von Toll in French. Two of the figures pinned to the trees screamed in \npain. They had no tongue, no distended belly filled with stolen blood, but no-\none seemed to notice, or if they did notice, no-one cared. In the joy of the \nhunt, they had been seized, and that was that. \nAnd so, the expedition began again, with no sign of progress or clear \ndestination, only the pure focus and wild excitement to find ... it. Whatever it \nwas, wherever it might be, they would not stop, would never stop, until it was \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 133 – Dead Horse \n \n9 \n \nfound and taken. The supplies had run out days ago, and it was becoming clear \nthat zeal will only sustain you so far, as one or two of the group began to falter \nand fall from exhaustion and hunger. They were left behind. The most painful \npart was Jack, who would spend hours walking beside me, telling me of all the \nwonders we would see, all the delights we would be a part of, when we finally \nfound it. Or caught it. Or killed it. Whatever it might have been. It broke my \nheart to see what I had done to him, to know where my path had set him. \nWhen I finally felt my own body give out, it was a relief almost too acute to \ndescribe. I fell, and they left me behind. \nI awoke back in Dead Horse camp. Some of the Kalapolos had found me \ncollapsed in the forest and had taken pity on me. I won’t bore you with the \ndetails of my fevers and suffering, save to say that the shellshock I received in \nthe Great War was nothing to what I went through after my return. I have \nbeen careful, though. Nobody knows I am alive, and I desperately wish to keep \nit that way. \nI am sure, deep within myself, that what Raleigh Rimell hunted out in that \njungle, he will never find, he can never find. What those people pursued, what \nI pursued, doesn’t exist, and I dearly hope that no others will ever suffer for \nour obsession. The sooner the world forgets them, forgets me, the better. I just \nwish I hadn’t lost my son to learn that lesson. \nARCHIVIST \nStatement ends. \nWhat do you make of that then? \n \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 133 – Dead Horse \n \n10 \n \nDAISY \nDon’t know. Why? \nARCHIVIST \nOh, well, you’re a … you’re a Hunter, right? \n(Daisy grunts) \nARCHIVIST (Cont.) \nI just wondered. I’ve been looking for evidence of a Hunt ritual, to see if it was \none of the ones Gertrude stopped, and this is the closest thing I’ve been able \nto find. \nDAISY \nCould have been one. I think. \nARCHIVIST \nBut it didn’t work. I don’t even know how it was meant to work. \nDAISY \nNo. \nARCHIVIST \nBut why? There was no outside interference, no other powers, even the \nindigenous tribes who could theoretically have derailed it seemed to stay \naway. So why didn’t it work? \nDAISY \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 133 – Dead Horse \n \n11 \n \nI don’t think it was about that. \nARCHIVIST \nI’m not sure I understand. \nDAISY \nJust a feeling. When I was ... You know what my least favourite part of a case \nwas? \nARCHIVIST \nPolice brutality lawsuit? \nDAISY \n(Curt laugh) Arresting them. I hated the handcuffs. Th-the click. It meant the \nchase was done; the hunt was over. Satisfying, on a good day, sure, but… \n“moreish”. I never really wanted it to be over. \nARCHIVIST \nHm. You don’t think the Hunt would let its ritual end? You don’t think it would \nlet them find the culmination. \nDAISY \nDon’t know. Maybe? Sometimes I lost purpose because I let myself get too into \nit, gave them openings just because I wanted to keep chasing. Like with you. \nSometimes it meant I lost them. \nARCHIVIST \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 133 – Dead Horse \n \n12 \n \nOne of the bits I’ve managed to decode from Gertrude’s notes, it references \nsomething she calls “The Everchase”. You think that might be it? The ritual that \nnever ends because the Hunt is all in the pursuit? \nDAISY \nI don’t know. You’re the expert. \nARCHIVIST \nNo, no. I like it. It’s a good theory. \nDAISY \nBasira said you could just “know” all this now anyway. \nARCHIVIST \nIt’s, uh, I can’t really control it. \n[Door opens] \nARCHIVIST \nOh. \nBASIRA \nHey, there you are. You’re meant to be doing your exercises. \nDAISY \nYou were out. \nBASIRA", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 4, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 4480}}
