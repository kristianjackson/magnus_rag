Henry himself I have the \ngreatest respect for, as he trained under Sir Robert Smirke, who had received \nhis knighthood not two years previous. Henry was very effusive about the \ntalents and prospects of young Mr Scott and was at great pains to inform me \nthat his young protege had also received certain architectural tutelages from \nSir Robert himself. He said this with the oddest of looks, as though there was \nsome jolly secret between us. I rather just nodded as if to say I took his \nmeaning and he left well enough alone. He even showed me George’s work on \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG050 – Foundations \n3 \n \ndraughting his plans for the Fishmongers’ Hall near London Bridge, which had \nopened to great acclaim. It certainly seemed clear to me that he would make a \nfine assistant, at least for as long as I were to able to keep him. \nAnd so, we began our brief collaboration, the subject of which was the \nworkhouse, a topic, as I’m sure you recall, very close to my heart. The plight of \nthe poor and destitute has been a national disgrace for far too long and, when \nI was handed the task of designing them by the Poor Law Commissioners, it \nwas an undertaking I embarked on with no small amount of zeal. My original \ndesigns were intended to assist in the easy segregation of inmates by sex, age \nor infirmity, with capacity and utility foremost in my mind. \nI know many look on the workhouse with disdain, calling it the ‘Paupers’ \nBastille’ and seeing very little distinction between the workhouse and the \nprison. But this is a deeply myopic view to take. The prison keeps its population \nfor the safety and improvement of society at large, while the workhouse exists \nfor the improvement of the inmates themselves. To criticise the conditions as \nharsh is to overlook the basic moral imperative of work itself and I firmly \nbelieve that to dismiss the punitive as a valid form of moral improvement is to \nconsign many a poor soul to perdition. But I digress, Jonah, I am so used to \npenning defences of my designs that it seems I can write little which does not \ndo so. \nIt was in his assistance with these designs that George first began to show \nthose peculiarities of character that I would become so ill at ease with. His \nprocess redrafting was deeply unsettling. He would spend hours in the office \nsimply staring at the drawings, saying nothing, taking no food or drink and \nignoring any enquiry or interruption. Then, in a single move, he would gather \nup all the papers and retire to his private office, locking the door behind him. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG050 – Foundations \n4 \n \nThen, from the other side of that firm oak door, I would hear the strangest \nsounds, muttering and shouting. \nIt was always in George’s voice alone and I could never quite discern the \nwords. It often sounded as though he were in some great distress and, on \nmore than one occasion, I was within minutes of summoning a constable to \nassist in breaking through the door, when he would emerge, glistening from \nexertion and holding completely re-done drawings. I’m sure I even saw blood \non his collar once. \nThe designs themselves were little better. He would take the solid functionality \nof my original plans and re-make them in all sorts of odd symmetries, which \nwhile architecturally intriguing, generally sacrificed many practical \nconsiderations. He also, without fail, made everything closer. Passageways \nwould be narrowed and sleeping quarters shrunk, until a building designed to \nhold 300 paupers would be re-made to house almost twice that number. \nAs I mentioned before, I have no objection to harsh conditions within the \nworkhouse to dissuade the idle from taking residence there, but the cramped \nplans that George would present me bordered upon the claustrophobic and I \nwas generally unable to use them. Each time I told him so, his face would \ntighten in momentary anger and his lips would go white. Then I would watch as \nhe took that rage and discarded it, once again becoming the genial, if \nsomewhat serious, young man I had first met. It was an odd sight. \nWhen his father died in 1834, it came as no great surprise to me that he chose \nto resign from my service. He told me he considered it necessary to become \nthe provider for his family, though I have my suspicions he was also eager to \nno longer have his designs subject to my", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 1, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 4499}}
