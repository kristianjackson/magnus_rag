I have to be. The job I was on at \nthe time was a long way from legal and even if the courts could never prove it, \nlet's just say the people I worked for take privacy very seriously indeed. All \nnames I give here aside from my own are aliases. \nIt's hard to get a job in archaeology these days. I mean, I guess it always was, \nbut education funding is being squeezed across the board and the fact is most \nhigher up positions in the field tend to only open up once the previous \noccupant dies. It's sad, but if you look at a full lecture hall on the archaeology \ncourse of any major university, you can be pretty sure that none of the people \nyou're looking at are going to end up doing it for a living. A few might get \nassistant positions on a project or two, but the long, thankless hours and \nendless grind to climb a ladder already full up with old posh men will probably \nchange their minds. I suppose what I'm saying is I was never going to be a 'real' \narchaeologist. \nSo when I got a chance to do some unlicensed work, I figured it was either that \nor train to be a teacher. And I hate children. See, the thing is that there's a lot \nof very valuable stuff in the ground: ancient artefacts, forgotten knowledge, all \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 064 – Burial Rites \n \n3 \n \nthat good stuff. But acquiring it takes a lot of time, a lot of money and a lot of \nfiddly licences and permissions, not to mention that governments can get very \ngrabby when it comes to the prizes of antiquity. You can't take three steps in \nthis field without some wannabe Indiana Jones declaring something or other \n'belongs in a museum'. But museums have very limited budgets and the \nprivate market has a never-ending appetite for valuable ancient treasures. So \nyou have my industry, which is like normal archaeology but a bit more... free-\nform. I like to think of myself as a 'rogue archaeologist', but I think most people \nwould just call me a grave robber, which is daft because half the time it isn't \neven graves we're dealing with, but that makes surprisingly little difference in \nterms of legality. \nI worked for a man named Stavo. I still might; I'm not sure. He doesn't really \nmake contact when we don't have a job and this one ended badly enough that \nI'm not sure whether or not I'm getting another call. I hope so. I really don't \nwant to be a teacher. He first contacted me three years after funding fell \nthrough for my second PhD and some professional disputes meant that the \nchances of my career continuing were somewhere between zero and no. He \nwas very to the point with me, explaining right away that he organised rapid \nturnaround illegal digs, taking whatever high value finds were transportable \nand selling them to private collectors. He had plenty of labour, security and", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 0, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 3714}}
