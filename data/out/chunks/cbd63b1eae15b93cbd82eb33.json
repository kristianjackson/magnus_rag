Well, let’s just say the suicide attempts far \noutnumbered the murder attempts and I never lost any sleep over that fact. \nNor did any of the inmates. I made sure of that. \nAfter lock-up at 7pm sharp, I made a point of keeping my wing dark and quiet. \nIt helped that they were single cells, of course. No worries about conversation \nor violence between cellmates, but even then I was careful to make it very \nclear that drawing my attention after lights-out was something they would \nregret. I’ll admit, I was a real bastard when I worked there. Sometimes you \nneed a bastard to keep an eye on the monsters. And back then I really thought \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG052 – Exceptional Risk \n3 \n \nthat the murderous filth we were looking after were the closest thing this \nworld had to real monsters. I was wrong, of course. \nI’d been working there for almost five years when Robert Montauk came to us. \nNow don’t get me wrong, we’ve had plenty ‘celebrity’ criminals pass through \nWakefield over the years, but I can’t say it didn’t give me a slight chill to know \nthat we were going to be keeping watch over the most prolific British serial \nkiller of all time. I mean, he killed 40 people. That’s a ridiculous number. I \nmean, maybe in America, where you have so many places to hide. But his \nnearest competition in this country barely reached half that. And he used to be \na policeman. All told, you had the ingredients for a cocktail of posturing, unrest \nand violence among certain quarters of the inmates. He wouldn’t normally \nhave gone to Wakefield, as his crimes had no sexual element to them, but we \nwere the only ones that had space for a prisoner needing that level of security \nand scrutiny. \nHe was a big guy. I wasn’t expecting that, to be honest. Usually with that kind \nof prisoner, they’ve got a ‘you’d never know to look at them’ sort of feeling, \nbut Montauk looked like a killer. He must have been almost six foot six and \nbuilt like a barge. His dark hair was cropped close to his scalp, showing off a \nflat, angular face. Not to put too fine a point on it, but the man was terrifying. \nWhen he entered the rec room for the first time, I could almost hear the \ndeflating egos, as a dozen would-be hoodlums thought better of trying to \nmake a reputation by standing up to Robert Montauk. Of course, there’s \nalways one, and in this case it was Ivan Ilic, an aspiring Serbian gangster, who \ndecided to go after him, jumping him from the side. Me and the other warders \nhad been waiting for something like this, but we were too slow to get there in \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG052 – Exceptional Risk \n4 \n \ntime. Well, maybe we could have gone faster, but 40 murders... sometimes \nyou want to look at what you’re up against. \nIlic was not a small man and nearly matched Montauk in height, if not in \nweight, but there was an energy to Montauk, a tightness, like a rubber band \nabout to snap. Ilic leapt forward with a shout and delivered a solid punch right \ninto the other man’s kidneys, but it was as though he’d hit the pressure pad on \na bear trap. With terrifying speed, the hands snapped round, gripping the \nSerbian’s right arm. There was a half moment of complete silence as everyone \nseemed to be holding their breath to see what Robert Montauk did next. He \nbrought his hands around with a violent twist, cleanly dislocating his assailant’s \narm with a nasty pop and replacing the silence with a scream and a sting of \nSlavic curse words. \nAt this point, me and the other screws broke it up. I got the unenviable task of \ntaking the still cursing Ivan Ilic down to get his arm treated. I didn’t see \nMontauk again for some time. After that little incident, he was immediately \ntransferred over to F block, where he wasn’t going to be a danger to anyone \nbut himself. I’d occasionally hear rumours about him filtering through the \nother inmates and there wasn’t a spooky story in Wakefield that didn’t have \nhim at the centre of it. Barely a week went by without some loudmouth \nnobody spreading word that he’d killed a guard, or escaped, or been found \ndead in his cell with his heart ripped out. It was never true, of course, not at \nthat point. I think most of it came from Dave Harrington on F wing. He always \nloved to drop fake gossip on new inmates and the old hands knew not to trust \na word he said. \n \nIt was in 1998 when–", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 1, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 4418}}
