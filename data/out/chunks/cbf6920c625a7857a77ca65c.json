If he noticed me \nwatching him, he gave no sign of it. When I looked at him, I had the strangest \nfeeling, like a wave of dizziness washing over me, and my stomach dropped \nagain, like it had when I fell.

I congratulated him on overcoming his fear before gently reminding \nhim that the reason we needed the phone was to call an ambulance. He \nnodded like he hadn't forgotten, and made the call. \nThe ambulance and hospital did pass in a bit of a blur.
