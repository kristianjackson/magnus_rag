They were both tied to \nchairs and quite dead. Cause of death was listed as blood loss from multiple \nlacerations all over their legs and torso, as well as removal of both their faces \nwith a sharp blade, possibly a scalpel. The face of James Mann was found to \nhave been partially eaten by Father Burroughs. He pled guilty to all charges \nbrought before him and is currently serving two life sentences at Wakefield \nPrison, though HMPS refused our request for a follow-up interview. \nWhat interests me is the paralleling of Father Burroughs’ climactic \nhallucination with reality, and the fact that at no point did he perform any \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG020 – Desecrated Host \n10 \n \nactions that might be analogous with the binding and actual murder of the \nstudents. Also, it strikes me that the altar server he described seems out of \nplace with most of his other delusions, in that he appeared to have active \nagency, which is uncharacteristic for these visions the priest describes. Finally, \nthere is the small detail mentioned in the police report that none of the tools \nused to kill or mutilate the victims were found at the scene. This all leads me to \nbelieve that there may have been a second person there that night, although \nfrom talking with the police, I get the impression that there is little appetite for \nre-opening the case, considering how successful the initial prosecution was. \nThere’s one other detail Tim uncovered that sticks out to me. It’s a name I \nrecognise, though I have no idea what it could mean. The Oratory was \nobviously not the actual scene of Father Burroughs’ crimes, but there was one \nstrange thing that happened a few days prior. They received delivery of a pale \nyellow stole, which apparently vanished less than a day after they signed for it. \nThis would be unusual, but not necessarily noteworthy, if it wasn’t for fact that \none of the deacons recalled the package was handed to them by a company \ncalled Breekon and Hope Deliveries. \nRecording ends. \n[The Magnus Archives Theme - Outro] \n \nThe Magnus Archives is a podcast distributed by Rusty Quill and licensed under \na creative commons attribution, non-commercial share alike 4.0 international \nlicense.
