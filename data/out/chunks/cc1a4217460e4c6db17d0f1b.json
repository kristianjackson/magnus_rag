Watched you sneak away. \nARCHIVIST \nSorry. \nBASIRA \nYou apologise too much. \nARCHIVIST \n(Chuckling) Martin says the same thing. \nBASIRA \n(Chuckling) Like he’s any better. \n(Long beat) \nWhy didn’t you want me to hear this one? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 179 – Accomplice \n \n7 \nARCHIVIST \nWhat? \nBASIRA \nYou weren’t this cagey about the other ones, meaning you wanted to keep this \none secret. \nARCHIVIST \nUhh... Hm. \nBASIRA \nBecause this one was Daisy’s victim? \n(Beat) \nARCHIVIST \nYes. \n(Beat) \nBASIRA \nDidn’t think you knew what the statement was going to be before it \nhappened? \nARCHIVIST \nI just had a sense of it. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 179 – Accomplice \n \n8 \nBASIRA \nSo… what? You thought I’d hear he was a murderer, and I'd agree with her? \nMaybe I'd figure she was doing the apocalypse a favour by taking him out? \nARCHIVIST \nI don’t know what I thought. \nBASIRA \nSure. \nARCHIVIST \nI don’t know alright! I was… I was worried that if you listened, it might feel like \nan accusation. After everything we’ve already talked about, I-I mean... What \ngood would it do for you to hear? What’s in this one that you don’t already \nknow? People have their reasons for doing wrong? The system hurts \neveryone? \nJust seemed kind of pointless. \nBASIRA \nYeah. I guess. \nARCHIVIST \nHuh, honestly, I just wanted to avoid this conversation. \nBASIRA \nShould’ve been sneakier, then. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 179 – Accomplice \n \n9 \nARCHIVIST \nYeah. \n…Never been my strong suit, has it? \nBASIRA \nHow many times have you been kidnapped at this point? \nARCHIVIST \nThat depends if you— \n…Huh. \nBASIRA \nSay it. \nARCHIVIST \nDepends if you count Daisy. \n(Basira sighs) \nSo... You did hear it, then? \nBASIRA \nYeah. \nARCHIVIST \nWhat, uh... What did you think? Did it… help? \nBASIRA \nWith what? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 179 – Accomplice \n \n10 \nARCHIVIST \nI don’t know. \n(Beat) \nBASIRA \nMe neither. \n[Martin — with backpack jangling — comes running] \nMARTIN \n(Breathless) Hey, she’s- she’s, she’s here! \nBASIRA \nWha-what? Now? \nMARTIN \nYeah, yeah, she just, she just tore into a guy! \n(Shaken) It was... He was, urgh... \nARCHIVIST \nYes, we understand, Martin. \nBASIRA \nYou didn’t think this was worth mentioning!? \nARCHIVIST \nI didn’t notice. I was talking to you! \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 179 – Accomplice \n \n11 \nBASIRA \nFine, whatever. Let’s go. \n(Sound of frustration from Martin) \n[Tape click off] \n[Tape click on] \n[Faint roar of furnace flames; sounds of chewing and cracking bone, \nwith rough bear-like breathing, that is stopped every so often so as \nto sniff the air] \n[Tense movements as Basira takes aim] \nARCHIVIST \n(Hushed) Is this a good enough angle? We can try and sneak round to the \nother side of the furnaces, but then the smoke wouldn’t cover us— \nBASIRA \nIt’s fine. Shut up. I just need to focus. \nARCHIVIST \nAlright. \n[Basira shuffles and re-aims] \n[Meat sounds, then Daisy removes a limb] \n(Distressed martin sound) \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nTake your time... \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 179 – Accomplice \n \n12 \nBASIRA \nI will do as soon as you… Shut. Up. \n[Basira re-aims, again] \n(Martin gasps) \n[A tin and glass are knocked over] \n[Daisy pauses, sniffs the air, then resumes consumption] \n(Beat) \nBASIRA (CONT’D) \n(Hushed, angry) The hell was that!? \nMARTIN \nSorry! Sorry! I’m sorry! I’m sorry! I’m sorry! \nARCHIVIST \nWhat happened? \nMARTIN \nI-I thought you were about to fire. \nBASIRA \nSo you gasped just in case? \nMARTIN \nLook, it’s a tense situation alright? I don’t know what I’m doing here. I’m not a \nsniper— \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 179 – Accomplice \n \n13 \nBASIRA \nGoddamnit. \n[A growl comes from Daisy’s direction; before recommencing \nrendering noises] \nARCHIVIST \nBasira, are you sure you’re up to this? It doesn’t need to be right now. W-We \ncan always back off, regroup, wait for a better situation. One where she isn’t… \nelbow deep in some poor sod’s corpse. \nBASIRA \nDon’t do that. \nARCHIVIST \nSorry. \nMARTIN \nWhat am I missing here? \nBASIRA \nHe knows as well as I do that the only reason we’re even able to get this close \nis because she’s busy with a kill. There isn’t going to be a better opportunity. \nMARTIN \nNow or never then.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 2, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 4242}}
