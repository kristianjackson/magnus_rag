I gave \nthem to him. I took the keys to the oldest of the vans, and just handed them \nover. Anything to get them out of my office. I’m not a small man, you \nunderstand, and I’m not used to feeling intimidated. I got into plenty of \nscrapes when I was young, and there was a small part of me screaming to \nteach these disrespectful punks a lesson. But when this other Breekon took the \nkey from me, what I felt beneath the skin of his hand convinced me I had made \nthe right choice. Then they turned and left. \n\nI wish I could say that was the last I saw of them, that they stole one of my \nvans and drove away, never to return. But they did return. And even worse, \nthey started to make deliveries. \nThey were innocuous at first; the right things delivered to the right people on \ntime. Then it became the right things delivered to the wrong people. Then the \nwrong things being delivered. \nThen the very wrong things. Strange folk began coming around asking for \nBreekon and Hope, and when I told them who I was, they just shook their \nheads, and I knew who they were after. \nThey often brought crates or boxes with them and, once, a sack full of hair. I \nnever opened any of these, or looked to closely when they came around. There \nwas something in me that wanted to believe if I was smart, and kept my head \ndown, maybe I could somehow get through it. I couldn’t accept that something \nlike this could just turn up, and casually destroy me without cause. \nIf there was a reason they’ve picked me, I have never found out. I have asked \nthem, but unsurprisingly got no answers. There must be other delivery \ncompanies, surely, and it was the deliveries they seem to focus on. They’re out \nmost of the day and night, usually, allowing me some rest away from their \nhorrid blank faces. But they always come back. When not on delivery, they \nstand in the break room, facing the wall. Sometimes they laugh, suddenly and \nabruptly, as though they’ve both simultaneously thought of a hilarious joke. It \nsounds like the laugh track in an old sitcom, and cuts off almost immediately. \nWhen I get fitful sleep in the small fold-out cot I keep in my office, I can sense \nthem standing there, looking at me. I don’t go home anymore. I’m afraid of \n\nwhat might happen if they followed me outside of a professional environment. \nMy other drivers have been disappearing. \nFor all that, they do seem to have friends, or at the very least, people who \ncome to see them regularly. Most I don’t remember, the features difficult to \nput together from memory, but I know that more than once I’ve seen the pair \nof them talking to a figure at the other end of the depot. They always make \nsure these meetings are in shadow, and I can never get close enough to see \nexactly who they’re talking to, but I think they’re dressed like a circus \nringmaster. \nAnd so it’s been going for the last couple of years. I think I might even be \npaying them, though it’s hard to tell. The account book, as well as the shipping \nlogs and manifests, keeps filling up with entries I don’t remember, although it \nis definitely my handwriting. \nI am not sure how long this might continue for. Maybe years. Maybe forever. \nWhatever fight was in me at the beginning is gone. Occasionally, when they \nfirst began to take over, I would start to march up to them, my mind whirring, \nfilled with demands and threats and ultimatums. Then they’d look at me with \nthose blank, impassive eyes, and I’d feel all my resolve simply melt away. \nNow it’s just a memory. A daydream. I’ve forgotten the taste of determination. \nIt won’t last forever, though, because I think they’ve decided they’re done with \nme. \nI came into work yesterday to find a box sat on my desk. The address and label \nhad been completely scribbled over in black marker pen, and it was impossible \nto tell from what was left where it had originally been sent to.
