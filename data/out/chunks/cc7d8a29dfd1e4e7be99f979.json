My hand reached slowly for the handle, when I heard someone \nmoving behind it. \nNo, it wasn’t someone moving. It was many people, I’m sure of it. The sounds of \ndozens of limbs moving and stepping and shuffling in unison. Then laughter. Then \nweeping. Then movement again. I looked down at my shaking hand, and saw that \nseeping under the door was something slick and colorless, a greasy residue that \nsmelled overpoweringly of that sickly sweet odor. \nI took a step back, suddenly nauseated and almost fell into the arms of Claude, \nwho had silently come up behind me. He held me for a moment, \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 153 – Love Bombing \n10 \n \nlooking with such intensity that I felt like he was weighing my soul, his expression \nunreadable. Then he sighed and shook his head. \n“You do not belong here. You are not worthy of its love. Leave.” \nEven after everything I’d seen I can’t tell you how deeply those words hurt me. I \nturned and I ran out of the building, out of the compound, out into the night. I ran \nuntil I reached a road, then sat there shaking until a passing car took pity on me \nand took me down to the local sheriff’s office. Eventually my case got passed up \nthe line; apparently a few different government agencies were interested in the \nDivine Chain, mainly for possible tax fraud, and my testimony was pretty much \nexactly what they needed to go in there and check it out. They didn’t tell me what \nthey found until after I’d had a few sessions with a psychiatrist who specialized in \ncult deprogramming, and I’m sure it wouldn’t be hard to find out most of the \ndetails online. I’m pretty sure it made national news. \nThere is one thing, however, that I think they lied about. The reports detailed a \nmass grave in the rooms of Claude Vilakazi with bodies mutilated and mixed \ntogether, some who’d been dead for weeks, but I don’t believe that. Whatever \nwas in that room, I am absolutely sure that when the authorities arrived it was \nstill alive. I just don’t know what alive means when it comes to something like \nthat. It doesn’t matter though. The compound was destroyed in an ‘accidental \ngenerator explosion’, and everything was gone. \nThere’s a part of me that’s glad, a sick little part that’s happy, that whatever love \nwas there, whatever I couldn’t be a part of, is gone from the world. And no one \nelse gets it either. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 153 – Love Bombing \n11 \n \nARCHIVIST \nStatement ends. \nI swear, I almost find the cult dedicated to the dark powers of fear easier to \nunderstand in the more mundane sort. At least they have some consistency. \n(inhale) This, well... the Corruption at work if I had to guess, though with \nunsettling echoes of uh, Fleshliness. \nI suppose, uh - \n[Static rises.] \nWait. \nOh, uh. (clears throat) \n[A phone rings.] \nARCHIVIST (Cont.) \n(Heavy breathing) Yeah, I think, um - I think you should probably get down he-- \n[A loud thud.] \nTREVOR \nHello, lad. \nJULIA \nYou miss us? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 153 – Love Bombing \n12 \n \n[The Archivist makes a noise of protest.] \nJULIA \nSit. Down. \nTREVOR \nOr we check if you’re still human enough to bleed. \n(Julia laughs.) \nJULIA \nYou’ve got something of ours. \nTREVOR \nSomeone. \nJULIA \nTook him right from under our noses. \nTREVOR \nIn our own house. \nJULIA \nI call that rude, don’t you? \nARCHIVIST \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 153 – Love Bombing \n13 \n \nGerry wasn’t yours. You had no right -- \nTREVOR \n(Mockingly) You hear that, Julia? “Gerry”! \nJULIA \nSounds like you’ve got pretty chummy. (Threateningly) Where is he? \nARCHIVIST \nGone. \nJULIA \nWhat do you mean, gone? \nTREVOR \nNot gonna ask you again, son. \nARCHIVIST \nI burned the page. Released him. \n(Pause.) \nTREVOR \nAren’t that right noble of you? \nJULIA", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 4, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 3826}}
