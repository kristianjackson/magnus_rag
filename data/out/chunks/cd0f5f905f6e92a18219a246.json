Just you. I am a fine actor, and a very capable physical \nperformer, but all that is simply the dues I pay to earn my way to a monologue. \n \nFor the last two weeks I have been performing the part of Jaques in As You Like \nIt. Do you know you Shakespeare? Well, it’s not the greatest production of the \nplay, which can be very funny if done right. The director, a man name David \nAustin, has neither the vision nor the spark to turn it into something truly \nmemorable, and the reviews reflect that. I don’t care, though. That’s not why I \ndo it. You see, there is one part of As You Like It that almost every English-\n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG108 – Monologue \n \n3 \n \nspeaking person will know. And that is a monologue by Jaques: “All the world’s \na stage, and all the men and women on it merely players. They have their exits \nand their entrances and one man in his time plays many parts, his acts being \nseven ages.” \n \nI told you you’d know it. \n \nAnd for all his failings, Mr David Austin made one directorial decision for which \nI cannot praise him enough. During this soliloquy, he has the other actors in \nthe scene walk upstage, beyond the lights, and has me delivering the lines out, \ninto the audience, alone. For the play it’s a bad decision. The scene is supposed \nto be Jacques performing, joking, for the amusement of the Duke and his \nfriends, so this staging makes something that should be light and energetic into \na serious and soulful meditation, and it doesn’t work from a dramatic point of \nview. But for me? Declaiming, casting my voice out, surrounded by people \nwatching me, yet completely alone – I have rarely had part that feeds my soul \nlike this one. \n \nIt helps that we’re performing at the Duke’s Theatre in Covent Garden. It’s \nabout as traditional a theatre as you’re likely to find, and when the light shines \nthe audience is rendered as mere silhouettes, completely anonymous. At least, \nuntil four nights ago. \n \nIt was my big moment, act two scene seven. The others had vanished, the \naudience was gone and it was just me. At least, at first. I remember, it was as I \nbegan to talk about the Justice, the fifth age of man, that I saw it. It was a \nmask, a theatre mask, not one of the happy/sad ones you might associate with \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG108 – Monologue \n \n4 \n \nthe stage, but like an old Greek chorus mask: neutral, with a faint aspect of \nmourning about the mouth and eyes. It sat on the top of a thick black cloak, \ndraped to completely cover whoever might be wearing the mask. But I knew it \nwas empty. It was a hollow shape of a man that had no life, no presence to it. \nAnd I saw it in the middle of the third row, as clearly as if it were lit by a second \nspotlight. \n \nI stumbled, of course I stumbled. I don’t believe anyone in the actual audience \nreally noticed, though the other actors offered their faux-sympathies over it \nafterwards. I did make it to the end, and pushed on through the rest of the \nperformance, but the mask did not disappear, and watching the other actors \nquickly convinced me that either they did not notice the thing in the third row, \nor they simply could not see it. \n \nOddly, I never feared for my sanity. I’ve always been superstitious, and I had \nno doubt that what I had seen was some sort of spectre or omen. Of what, \nhowever, I had absolutely no idea. To be perfectly honest, I still don’t. This is \none of the reasons I am here, because I have this deep and gnawing fear that it \nportends nothing but itself, and within that there is some strangely awful fate \nwaiting for me. \n \nI have never been quite as social as I am told an actor should be. Rehearsals \nhave always been a professional thing for me and have rarely resulted in \nfriendships, and I actively avoid after-show drinks. It will perhaps not surprise \nyou to discover I instead prefer to walk the city, to find those streets and \nplaces where the night crowd does not gather, and wander those empty lights, \nclearing my head as I leave the heat and cloying conversation behind.
