Look, it’s not a big deal. We just need to do a few of them again. \n \nARCHIVIST \nOut of the question. \n \nTIM \nIt’s just confusing if not. Er, like the garbageman’s statement. \n \nARCHIVIST \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG033 – Boatswain’s Call \n2 \n \nMr. Woodward. \n \nTIM \nYeah, so, you said that Alan Parfitt was reported missing… ah, in August 2009, \nwhich would actually be six months after the statement had been given. \n \nARCHIVIST \nObviously it should have been 2008. I misspoke an ‘8’ as a ‘9’. What does it \nmatter? \n \nTIM \nWell, someone noticed. \n \nARCHIVIST \nWho? \n \nTIM \nEr, Josh Cole – great guy – he’s one of the students using our resources for a \ndissertation. Um… oh, and here, in Miss Montauk’s statement about her \nfather’s killings. You refer to case, um, 9220611 as case, um, 1106922. Oh, and \ndon’t get me started on the other case numbers around the Hill Top hauntings, \nthey’re a mess! \n \nARCHIVIST \nAlleged hauntings. And who honestly cares if I misspoke case 9220611 as \n1106922? Another student? \n \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG033 – Boatswain’s Call \n3 \n \nTIM \nWell, actually, yes. Um, Samantha Emery – she’s lovely – she’s actually doing a \nPhD in manifestations... \n \nARCHIVIST \nI don’t care. It’s not enough that Gertrude left us with such a pointlessly \nawkward filing system. Half the time she doesn’t even stay consistent in her \nown records. \n \nTIM \nTo be honest with you, er, I don’t really understand the system. \n \nARCHIVIST \nLast three digits of the year, then the day, then the month. I don’t know why \nshe did it like that, but I can’t change it now. \n \nTIM \nOh… okay… Alright, so what happens if more than one statement is given on \nthe same day? \n \nARCHIVIST \nI... don’t know. It never came up. Was there anything else? TIM Oh yeah, just \none. \n \nARCHIVIST \nGood lord. \n \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG033 – Boatswain’s Call \n4 \n \nTIM \nSo, in case 8163103 it isn’t clear if Albrecht’s wife is called ‘Clara’ or ‘Carla’ \n‘cause you keep switching back and forth… \n \nARCHIVIST \nWell, I’m sorry if I found it hard to read a 200-year old letter, written in cursive \nby a native German speaker. Who complained about that one? \n \nTIM \nOh, it’s, it’s not a complaint. I just noticed actually. Um, look I know you’ve \nbeen under a lot of pressure… it’s not a big deal, I just think it might be worth \nre-recording these statements. \n \nARCHIVIST \nNo. I don’t have time. I still have a mountain of haphazard statements to get \nthrough, not to mention that I need to keep this wretched tape recorder on \nhand just in case I encounter one of the files too stubborn to work on anything \nelse. And when I do, I have to actually read the damn thing, which is... \n \nTIM \nOh, woah, woah… woah! \n \nARCHIVIST \nFine. It’s fine. I just haven’t been sleeping much these last few months, what \nwith all this… worm business. Which reminds me, if you do see Elias, tell him \nthanks for the extra extinguishers.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 0, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 3456}}
