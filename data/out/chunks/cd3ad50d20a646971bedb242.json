Told me to come \nback if I got gangrene. I did have a look around the place to see if I could find \nWilfred, but there was no sign of him to be found anywhere. Asking around the \ntrench, no-one had seen him return among the wounded, so I began to \nreconcile myself to the fact that he was dead. He wasn’t the first friend I’d lost \nto the Germans nor even the first I’d seen die in front of me, but something \nabout that strange music that I heard in the moments before that explosion \nlingered in my mind and left me dwelling on Wilfred in many a quiet moment. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG00X – The Piper \n6 \n \nIt was probably about a week and a half later I heard shouting from the end of \nthe trench. It was a scouting party who had been reconnoitring the river that \nflowed near Savy Wood. Apparently, they had found a wounded officer lying in \na shell hole there and brought him back. I made my way over and was \nastounded to see that it was Wilfred. His uniform was torn and burned, he was \ncovered with blood and his eyes had a distant, far off expression to them, but \nhe was most definitely alive. I rode with him back up to the field hospital, along \nwith the Corporal of the squad who had found him. Apparently he had been \nlying in that hole for days, ever since the battle. They’d found him there, half-\ndead from dehydration and fatigue, covered in the gore of another soldier. \nWhatever shell had created the hole he’d ended up in had clearly annihilated \nsome other poor soul and it was in his gory remnants that Wilfred had lain for \nalmost two weeks. I waited outside the hospital tent while he was being \ntreated. The doctor came out shortly, a grave look on his face. He told me the \nLieutenant was physically unharmed – something I considered at the time \nnothing short of a miracle – but that he had one of the worst cases of shell \nshock the doctor had ever encountered and would have to be shipped back to \nEngland for recuperation. I asked him if I could see him, and the doctor \nconsented, though he warned me that Wilfred hadn’t said a word since he’d \nbeen brought in. \nAs soon as I stepped inside the medical tent I was overwhelmed by the sweet \nscent of decaying flesh and the moans of pain and despair. The sharp smell of \nthe disinfectant brought back unpleasant memories of chlorine gas attacks. \nStill, I eventually found my way over to Wilfred’s bed and, sure enough, there \nhe was, staring silently out at the world, though with an intensity that alarmed \nme. I followed his gaze to a bed nearby, and there I saw a private I didn’t \nrecognise. His forehead was slick with sweat and his chest rose and fell quickly,", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 3, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 2786}}
