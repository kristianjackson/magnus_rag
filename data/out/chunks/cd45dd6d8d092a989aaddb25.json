To stir the \nfeelings of man, to create a small place of being, divorced from the rest of the \nworld, while still retaining that balance is the true goal of the architect.’ \nI had never heard my profession talked of with such conviction and fire before \nand I will not lie to you, Jonah, the look in his eyes when he spoke scared me. \nWithout prompting, his tirade continued and he began to talk about George, \nabout shortcuts and symmetry and a patron that the young fool did not \nunderstand. I could follow very little of it and it seemed to be decidedly \nremoved from anything that I would consider architecture, but whatever it was \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG050 – Foundations \n6 \n \nthat Sir Robert had been teaching George, it appeared that the lessons had \nbeen put to less noble use than he had intended. \nIt was at this point that Henry noticed Sir Robert’s agitation from across the \nroom and came over to gently usher him away to the smoking room. He sent \nme a glance of mild reproach as he led his mentor away and I was left standing \nthere in the middle of the room, utterly confused and rather shaken. \nI resolved to avoid, where possible, having anything further to do with George \nand continued with my own works. I heard he had set himself up with the \nconstruction of workhouses according to his own designs. He had taken on a \npartner by the name of William Bonython Moffatt, a builder’s son with no \nmoral character to recommend him of any sort. They vigorously canvassed \nseveral district guardians and managed to acquire several commissions that \nhad previously been mine. Needless to say, I was rather taken aback by this \nutter lack of professional etiquette, but I was not without other projects, so I \nendeavoured to ignore it and leave him to whatever squalid internments he \ncared to build. \nIt was in September of ‘36 that it happened, shortly after George and Moffatt \nhad finally opened the first of their workhouses. I didn’t realise that was what \nhad happened until afterwards, ensconced as I had been in my own work. \nDarkness had fallen and still I was busy, lit by the reassuring glow of a dozen \ncandles. There was no clock in the workshop, a deliberate choice to stop the \nlateness of the hour disturbing me, but I suspect it to have been somewhere \npast midnight when I heard them. Footsteps. Heavy, thudding footsteps and \nthe click clack of a sturdy cane. My assistants had locked all the doors when \nthey left for the evening and, through the silence of my study, I could not have \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG050 – Foundations \n7 \n \nmissed the sound of them opening again. To my dying day, Jonah, I will aver \nthat no one entered the building before I heard the footsteps approach. \nAs their heavy tread grew closer and the clack of the cane struck louder, with a \nquiet malice, I heard another sound beneath them. The jangle of keys. I have \nnever in all of my life been possessed by such a fear as I was then. The walls \nand floor seemed to rise towards me, stealing the air from my lungs until I \nswear that I could feel the splinters from the ceiling digging into the soft skin of \nmy face. I couldn’t move as the thudding boot tread came to a halt outside the \ndoor and the cane came to rest with a final clack. \nI waited. I waited to have the last vestiges of life squeezed from me by \nwhatever this was. \nI don’t know how much time passed. And then, as though suddenly sloughing \noff a heavy cloak, the weight fell from me; the room returned to its natural \nproportions, which is to say it never truly changed, I think. It is hard to describe \nexactly, Jonah, so you will forgive my vagaries. I rose to my feet and in a \nmoment of foolhardy bravery that I doubt I shall ever truly understand, I \ngrabbed a candle and ran to the door, flinging it open. I saw a figure walking \naway, through the door to one of the clerk’s offices. It was short and wide and \nI could see the wood of the floor bow beneath its huge boots. It wore a tall, \nblack hat and only the thinnest wisps of grey hair were visible below. In its \ncoarse, ruddy hand, it held a hard-worn black cane tipped with iron. Then the \ndoor closed behind it and it was gone. \nI followed into the room behind it, but it was empty. There was no sign of the \nman, or whatever it was, that had gone in before me. The window was sealed \nand there was nowhere for someone of that size to hide. Still I searched. I \nwasn’t sure what els", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 3, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 4500}}
