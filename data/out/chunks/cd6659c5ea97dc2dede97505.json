God knows I hated him enough back then, \nbut… I could never called anything like that upon him. Not like that. I don't \nsuppose you need me to tell you how they found him. Four days later, dead in \nhis room. His throat was crushed. And his jaw was torn clean off. The police \nnever found it. \nI wouldn't have thought of it, really. Wouldn't have… put it all together even \nthen. Not if it hadn't been for the fact that, in the last days of our relationship, \nJosh had broken down. He told me that he still heard that calliope music. Far \noff, when he was alone. And it had been getting gradually closer. I mean, they \nsay you can hear one from almost a mile away. \n \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG024 – Strange Music \n11 \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nStatement ends. \nWhile I have what I would consider to be some natural reservations about a \ntale of murderous clown dolls, there are a few things that make me more \ninclined than usual to believe this statement. Firstly, as Ms. Denikin \nmentioned, she did provide a copy of the official police report into the \nburglary, which includes testimony from one Irene Harlow that appears to \nconfirm Ms. Denikin did possess both a steamer trunk and calliope organ, so \nthose at least existed. \nThe death of Joshua Drury is also at least as mysterious as she made it sound. \nIn addition to his jaw being torn clean off his skull, residual evidence indicates \nthat his throat was crushed with some sort of rope, apparently woven out of \nthick wool. There was no evidence of a struggle or of forced entry, no DNA \nevidence of anyone in the room aside from himself. No-one was ever arrested \nfor the crime. \nWhen discussing this case, Tim said it reminded him of some articles he'd read \non travelling circuses in Russia and Poland during the early 20th century. On a \nwhim, I hunted down a few of the volumes he mentioned in the Institute's \nlibrary, and sure enough on page 43 of Gregory Petry's Freaks and Followers: \nCircuses in the 1940s, I found a reproduction of an old black-and-white \nphotograph. It shows a small group of carnival workers: a contortionist, a fire-\neater, two strong-men, a ringmaster and a organist sitting behind a calliope. \nThe photograph is labelled as being from 1948 and taken in Minsk, Russia. Only \nthe ringmaster and organist are named: Gregor Osinov and Nikolai Denikin. \nThe name of the troupe was \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG024 – Strange Music \n12 \n \n(pronounced in Russian) Цирк другого [Phonetically: Tsirk druh-grova] the \nCircus of the Other. The name rings a bell, but I can't find any other reference \nto it. \nMs. Denikin emigrated to South-East Asia two years ago, so was unavailable for \nany follow-up, but I'm sure there must be more on this somewhere in the \nArchives. Because I know for a fact that sitting in the Magnus Institute's \nArtefact Storage, is a bright red Calliaphone steam organ. When I asked Elias, \nhe just told me that the record of its acquisition was “probably in the archive \nsomewhere” and no-one else knows anything beyond the fact that it was \nacquired somewhere in 2007. The keyboard cover is firmly locked, and \nscratched into the surface are the words: “Be still, for there is strange music”. \nRecording ends. \n[The Magnus Archives Theme - Outro] \n \nThe Magnus Archives is a podcast distributed by Rusty Quill and licensed under \na creative commons attribution, non-commercial share alike 4.0 international \nlicense.
