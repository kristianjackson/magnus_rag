Steadying me. Helping the words \nflow. \nIs it strange that here, now, that seems almost a comfort? This is the last time \nyou will hear from me. You must trust me on that and not come looking. Not \nthat you would – I know you’re too smart for sentimentality, especially after \nwhat I have to tell you – but I feel it worth saying, nonetheless. Perhaps I’m \nsimply prevaricating. Trying to cling on to a few more precious minutes of life. \nBut that’s not me. I know what awaits me and must have no hesitation in going \nto my reward. I know you’ve never had much patience for my faith, but \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 157 – Rotten Core \nperhaps it will provide you some small peace knowing I face my death gladly, \nknowing I have done my duty before God. \nI have spoken to you before of Christabel, my contact within the ECDC. She had \na run-in with the Crawling Rot some decades ago and has since then kept me \nup to date with any incidents they have encountered which display… unusual \nproperties. Well, she alerted me to what was internally believed to be a \npotential pandemic originating in the small town of Klanxbüll on the German-\nDanish border. From what I understand, it was a perfectly pleasant small town, \nremarkable mainly for a rail line running out to a large island off the mainland. \nBut as it was, it had been completely quarantined. Christabel reported that the \ndisease seemed to be artificial or man-made in origin, and her colleagues were \nkeen to label it as a bioweapon, but its behavior didn’t follow any normal \npatterns or vectors. Combined with its extremely disturbing symptoms, which \ncaused the skin and muscles to become loose and malleable until they \nsloughed completely off the body, leaving only a skeleton and organs… well, \nshe was certain that it was the product of an otherworldly evil, and called me. \nI’ve spoken before about how keenly I’ve watched news of possible \npandemics, which is where I suspect the Extinction may pull away from the \nCorruption during its emergence. This, alongside the possibility of the disease \nbeing man-made – though I am certain no human had anything to do with it – \nwell, it was more than enough to draw me in. \nI had no interest in compromising Christabel’s position, so I made my own \npreparations for entry, borrowing a hazmat suit from one of the tents erected \naround the perimeter. I always despised trying to move in those things, but it \nseems they’ve made some real improvements in them over the last fifteen \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 157 – Rotten Core \nyears, so I was able to stay relatively quiet as I talked my way past the cordon \nand headed into infected Klanxbüll. I’m certainly glad this happened south of \nthe border with Denmark, as my German is passable compared to my non-\nexistent Danish. \nOnce inside the town, it became rapidly apparent how bad the situation truly \nwas. You and I, Gertrude, have seen more visions of hell than anyone has a \nright to while living, but this was something else entirely. \nThin trails of blood and skin crisscrossed to the streets, and the walls and \nwindows of nearby buildings were coated in a fine sheen of discarded gore. It \ndidn’t take me long to find my first victim, wrapped around a lamppost. He had \nclearly tried to lean on it for support in his distress, but his flesh had begun to \nspread and fuse over it in thick, ropey tendrils. His bones were almost bare to \nthe elements. \nBut it was then that I saw the thing that, to my mind, is perhaps the worst of it. \nHis heart was exposed. It was beating fast, so fast, despite the awful green \ndecay that seemed to be eating at it. I knew at that moment there was nothing \nthat could be done to save the town. But I could, perhaps, identify the cause. \nAnd identify it I did. I began by checking houses, looking for anything that \nmight have been an unusual artefact or one of those dreadful books. Few \ndoors were locked, and many seemed to be swinging open in the breeze that I \nwas deeply thankful I could not smell. Still, for all the quaint homes with their \nslanted roofs that I combed through, I found nothing that might qualify as an \norigin for the small town’s gruesome demise. But neither did I find many other \nvictims. There were a few: a woman melted into her now crimson bed; an old \nman whose bright eyes still stared out of his skull, watching the television,", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 1, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 4486}}
