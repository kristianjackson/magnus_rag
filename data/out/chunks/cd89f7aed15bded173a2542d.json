I looked around for the source of the heat, but the \nradiators hadn’t been installed yet and I couldn’t see anything else that might \nbe warming the room. It continued, though, and soon I was sweating through \nmy shirt. I began to cough, and I could smell smoke, even though I couldn’t see \nany or any fire, for that matter. \nI fell to one knee and choked back a scream as I felt my skin began to crackle \nand burn. I began to pray again for protection, not for the place this time, but \nfor me. As I did, I felt… something answer me. And yet, I cannot stress this \nenough: what answered was not G-God. It wasn’t Him. Something else \nanswered my call for protection. I felt my lips move. They made no sound that I \ncould hear, but I felt them form every syllable. “I am not for you. I am marked.” \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG019 – Confession \n10 \n \nThe heat slowed in its increase but it did not stop. My mouth continued to \nspeak for me, when I heard the sound of a car engine outside and a great \ncrash. Instantly, the feeling was gone, as though it were never there, and \nlooking out, I saw the builder had managed to uproot a tree from the back \ngarden. I sat there for a while catching my breath, and when he came back \ninside, I told him I had completed the prayers and excused myself quickly. It \nwas the first time I had experienced… \nJONATHAN SIMS \nStatement ends. \nUnfortunately, this statement as it stands is incomplete and stops at this point. \nIt does not appear to be the actual end of the document, so I have hopes that \nthe rest is simply misfiled somewhere else in the archives. If this is the case, I \nwill record and add that part when it is found, either by myself or, given the \nscale of the Archive’s mismanagement, by my successor when I pass away \nfrom old age. \nWith this in mind, all but the most preliminary of investigations into this \nstatement are being put on hold until the rest is found. Most of the details do \nappear to be correct and match the statement given by Mr. Ivo Lensik in 2007. \nWe did find Father Burroughs’ arrest record, though, and I am very curious to \nsee how the events recounted here could have led to the incident in 2009, \nwherein he apparently murdered two first year university students following \nSunday Mass, and then peeled off and ate most of their skin. \nRecording Ends. \n[The Magnus Archives Theme - Outro] \n \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG019 – Confession \n11 \n \nThe Magnus Archives is a podcast distributed by Rusty Quill and licensed under \na creative commons attribution, non-commercial share alike 4.0 international \nlicense.
