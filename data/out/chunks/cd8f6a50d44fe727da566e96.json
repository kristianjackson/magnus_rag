Well, it was like that, except what seemed \nto seep out from underneath it wasn’t light. It was shadow. Like, if darkness \nwas somehow shining from behind it. As I got closer I started to hear \nsomething. I couldn’t really tell what it was under the buzzing in my ears, but \nthe best way I could describe it is that it sounded like a waterfall, but slowed \nright down. A steady, flowing crash and churn, but deep and drawn out. I \nwanted to ask the others if they heard it as well, but Leo was already moving to \nopen the door. I barely had time to get my torch out. \nI’m glad I did, though, because as the door opened every light in the building \nwent dark. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG073 – Police Lights \n7 \n \nThat moment I was in complete darkness had to be one of the longest seconds \nof my life. I felt like I'd gone blind. Not just my eyes but everything. Like every \nsense I had was severed and the only thing I could feel was a wave of nausea. It \nseemed like, for that second, I wasn’t anywhere that light had ever reached. \nThen, I clicked the button on my torch and the beam cut right through it. \nThe flashlight was weak, nothing like the power I would have expected from \nthe heavy bulb, but the faint glow was enough to bring me back to myself. I \nshone it behind me, over the pale, panicked faces of the others and, as it \ntouched each of them, I saw them start and reach for their own torches. Soon \nfour pale beams were struggling out into the thick, aggressive gloom. \nI turned around, trying to shine the light on the wall or even the door we came \nin from, anything that would give me a sense of the room we were standing in, \nbut it just disappeared into the pitch dark in all directions. Thinking about it \nnow, I realise, we never actually walked through the door. \nSmall flecks of black dust floated in the air, like... like inky snow. They moved \ngently through the torchlight and they never seemed to settle on the ground, \nand I began to realise how cold it was. \nEverything was so still, and the only sound was the same dull roar from up \nahead of us. I don’t know how long we stood there, but when my torch \nsputtered and died, I knew we didn’t have long. \nI took out another and turned it on. The light seemed even fainter than the \nfirst one. Still, it was something, and we started to walk forward, or at least \nwhat we assumed was forward. If anyone said anything I didn’t hear it. The \nblack dust danced in front of us, but it never seemed to actually touch us r land \non our clothing. There was no smell at all here. The building above us had \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG073 – Police Lights \n8 \n \nsmelt of sawdust, old metal and industrial cleaner, but down here there was \nnothing. I didn’t... I didn’t shine my torch upwards. I didn’t want to see if there \nwas a roof over our heads. \nBy this point we had easily walked the whole length of the building several \ntimes and still hadn’t seen anything. The roar was getting louder and louder, \nuntil it was all that was in my head. The four of us were all on our second or \nthird torches by that point, and I could feel that I was starting to panic. There \nwas a scream building up inside of me, clawing its way up my throat. Actually, \nyou know what? I might have been screaming. I don’t know. It was... it was \nimpossible to tell over the noise and the thick, choking darkness. Then \nGoodman’s flashlight beam hit something ahead of us and it... it all went to \nhell. \nI think it took about five seconds. Everything seemed to happen at once, and \nonly going over it in the reports afterwards was I able to process what I saw. \nFive seconds and everything was over, but I’ll try and describe it in as much \ndetail as I can. \nGoodman’s torch beam had landed on an old man. He was tall, but I couldn’t \nsay much more than that. \nHis body was hidden in the folds of a robe of some sort. It was the same colour \nas the dust that had filled the air and seemed to move and shift in the same \nway. His white hair was thin and wild, covering an unkempt face and a scraggly \nbeard. His eyes were milky white. I think he was blind. From the description \nthe sergeant had given us, I was sure this was Maxwell Rayner. \nNext to him was an old chair that looked like it could have come from a dinner \ntable.
