Maybe? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 169 – Fire Escape \n7 \nMARTIN \nThat turn. You-you took a hard turn after the roots back there; I knew that was \na thing! Why are we here? \nARCHIVIST \nIt's just, when you said— \nMARTIN \n(Firm) John, why have you taken us here? \nARCHIVIST \nJude Perry. \nThis is where Jude Perry rules. \n(Beat) \nMARTIN \nThat's the one who burned your hand, isn't it? \nARCHIVIST \nYes. \nMARTIN \nRight. I just assumed this would be... who was that landlord guy? \nARCHIVIST \nArthur Nolan. He's here; he has a part of it, but it's... huge. Bigger than you \ncould believe. There's so much fear in there. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 169 – Fire Escape \n8 \nMARTIN \nBut we're not going after him, are we. \nARCHIVIST \nNo. \n(Beat) \nYou said you were onboard. \nMARTIN \nI, I was! I am. I just thought— \nARCHIVIST \nIt wouldn't hurt? \nMARTIN \nThat we'd be safe. \nARCHIVIST \nI never said— \nMARTIN \nI know! I know, okay, I just… (bracing) Look, I ju, I just don't want to get \nburned, all right? It's, it's like my least favourite pain ever. \nARCHIVIST \nIs that, a joke? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 169 – Fire Escape \n9 \nMARTIN \n(Shaky) No, no, okay? I, I legitimately hate burns, right? They’re they're they're \nawful, and they scar horribly, and they just, it, it just makes me sick; I, I hate it. \nHate it! \nARCHIVIST \nAlright. If you really don't want to do this, w-we can go another way. \nMARTIN \nReally? \nARCHIVIST \nReally. My revenge... (sigh) Well, let's just say you're more important. \n(Beat) \nMARTIN \n…It's not just your revenge though, is it? Destroying her… it would help all \nthose people in there, wouldn't it? \nARCHIVIST \nMaybe? It's... (sigh) Like I said, I can't see the future. It wouldn't free them, if \nthat's what you're asking. ‘Free’ doesn't really exist in this place. \nMARTIN \nApart from us. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 169 – Fire Escape \n10 \nARCHIVIST \nI suppose. In a sense, though—How much of that is because (dry laugh) we are \ntrapped in our own quest to— \nMARTIN \nOkay let's, let's not dive into another… ontological debate right now. Not here. \nARCHIVIST \nFair enough. So are we going in or not? \nMARTIN \nYou're… I, y-you're asking me? \nARCHIVIST \nI should have told you before, so, I leave the decision to you. You know my \nfeelings on the matter. \nMARTIN \nI... do? \nARCHIVIST \nI— oh, right: I want revenge on Jude Perry. I want to… smite her. Make her feel \nwhat, (exhale) what all her victims felt. But I'm not willing to force you to \nsuffer for it. \nMARTIN \nOkay. So it's… \n(Irked) I have to choose, do I? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 169 – Fire Escape \n11 \nARCHIVIST \nOr we could sit here. \nMARTIN \nNo. No, I’m-I'm not going to choose; I don't, I don't think that's a fair decision \nto put on me. It's your revenge; your choice, not mine. \n(Long beat) \nARCHIVIST \nFine. We go in. \n[Distant sounds of part of the building collapsing] \n(Beat) \nMARTIN \n(Shaky) Al-alright then! \nARCHIVIST \nWe'll be fine. \nMARTIN \nJ— lead the way. \n[They start walking] \n[Tape clicks off] \n[Tape clicks on] \n[Hissing static starts]", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 1, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 3133}}
