That level, even stare. He \nwas appraising me like some sort of antique, like he was curious what my value \nmight be at auction. Then his face turned to a scowl of irritation and he \ngestured widely to his cargo, offering me the chance to examine it if I thought \nhim a criminal. His voice was deep, calm and measured, but his eyes had an \nanger in them that scared me. I looked around the container, not so much to \nlook at the contents, but just to avoid his gaze. Truth be told, I hated my job. It \nwears you down, to be someone who nobody wants to see. Smugglers and \ntraffickers hate me because I threaten to disrupt their business, I understand \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 066 – Held in Customs \n \n3 \n \nthat. But legitimate operators look at me in the exact same way, because they \nknow that an error on the manifest can be far more important than whether \nthey’ve got 2 kilos of heroin hidden in the boot of an imported car. \nI began to walk around, giving a cursory examination to the assortment of \nmismatched boxes surrounding Salesa. I didn’t open anything. I didn’t want to. \nI just wanted to make a small show of the fact that I could. It was the 18th of \nJanuary, about a month ago, and the container was ice cold. Fiddling around \nwith locks and fastenings would have needed me to take my gloves off and \nthat wasn’t happening. Salesa stood there in a tank top and unbuttoned shirt, \nseemingly oblivious to the chill. If he was trying to make some show of \ntoughness or bravado, then to be honest, it was working. I had no interest in \ncrossing this man. More important though, was the fact that smuggled \nantiques were so far down the list of priorities at that point, that from a career \npoint of view, bending down to stare at some flight case full of incorrectly \ndeclared pottery was a complete waste of my time. \nI sighed, got to my feet, and as I did so, I grabbed the edge of an old wooden \ncrate for support. I felt the lid shift slightly under my weight. I looked at it a bit \ncloser and couldn’t help but notice it didn’t seem to have any bolts or locks on \nit and the lid clearly hadn’t been nailed shut. I reached over to try and slide it \nback into place, but my gloved hand slipped, and as I tried to grip it, I swear I \nbarely touched the thing, but the wooden top slid further off, releasing a dusty \ncloud of air that sent me into a coughing fit. The air was dry and hot in a way \nthat seemed rather alarming in the frigid shipping container. The inside was \ndark, the light from the entrance not reaching this far back. I shined my light in \nand to my surprise, the crate appeared to be completely empty.
