Audio \nrecording by Jonathan Sims, Head Archivist of the Magnus Institute, London. \nStatement begins. \nARCHIVIST (STATEMENT) \nGertrude, \nIt should all be here, though god knows I was tempted to take a block for \nmyself just in case. I won’t even press you for where you got it, though if some \nof these leads pan out I might need to ask you to track down some more. I \nassume whatever surveillance meant you needed me to move it, is only \nkeeping track of you, but let me know if there’s anything I need to be on the \n\nlookout for. Anyway, you owe me a favour. And… maybe another one once you \nread this. It might come to nothing, but it’s something you should probably be \naware of. I’ll even make it a statement. Give your patron something to keep it \nsatisfied. It’s not like I sleep enough to worry about dreams. \nI was pursuing my researches into the new emergence I mentioned earlier. I \nknow you are dismissive of the possibility, but if I’m right, the sudden urgency \nof these “immediate dangers” you are so focused on could very well be a direct \nresult. But that’s for another day, as this particular instance turned out to be \nunconnected. The point is, I was alerted to a series of deaths by a coroner \nfriend of mine. \nAlthough all signs pointed to carbon monoxide poisoning, the bodies showed \nsigns of acute distress. The sort you don’t normally get when you die in your \nsleep. There was blood pooled in the back of the throat, and the vocal cords \nwere shredded, although no neighbours reported hearing a sound. And most \nimportantly, at all three scenes there was evidence of a second person who \nhad apparently left without suffering any ill effects. The deaths were about a \nfortnight apart, and when the third came in with the same symptoms, Bianca, \nthe coroner, called me in. For the last few years we’ve had an… arrangement. I \nslip her a bit of cash to feed a nasty habit she has, and if she’s called to any \ninquest which looks strange, I’m the first to know. \nDespite her weakness, Bianca is still a damn good coroner, and filled me in on \nthe details quickly. \nThe deaths had been carbon monoxide, she said, and by way of example \nshowed me a plastic cup full of blood. It was bright red. “Cherry red”, Bianca \ntold me, a good sign of CO poisoning.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 1, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 3984}}
