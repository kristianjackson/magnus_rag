I checked, \nand its radio wasn’t even on. It seemed to be coming from my music player, \nthough I had a look through my library and couldn’t find anything that matched \nit. The sky was still grey, though sweat dripped off me as I sat against a rotting \nfence post, and the numbers just kept coming. \n“Three. Zero. Five. Eight. Three. Nine. Two. Eight. Four. Six.” \nEventually I staggered to my feet and began to make my way home. My \nfootsteps were heavy, and my hands shook slightly as I tried to steady myself. \nDo you know that one of the symptoms of a heart attack is literally “a sense of \nimpending doom”? Well, I wasn’t having a heart attack, but I think I know what \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 144 – Decrypted \n \n5 \n \nthey mean. What settled over me wasn’t dread, there wasn’t enough \nuncertainty for that. No, it was doom. I was certain that some sort of disaster \nwas on the horizon. I’d walked less than a hundred yards when the numbers \nstopped coming, and ‘London Calling’ started playing again. \nThat summer seemed to drag on forever. The boredom and irritation of trying \nto care for my dad was only heightened by the weather, and we were both \nfeeling it. I just didn’t have anything to do. I don’t really want to go into my \nliving situation here, but it’s enough to say I wasn’t working a regular job, and \nwhile I could theoretically contact my old mates, they’d all gotten on with their \nlives without me. The world had moved on, and I was left behind. \nI did do a bit of research into numbers stations, but I didn’t find anything new. I \ndid find a couple of clips online, though, which were enough to convince me \nthat what I’d been hearing had been a numbers station, or at least a passable \nimitation, although the voices on the proper recordings sounded neutral, \nalmost mechanical – very different to the grating distorted mess I had heard. I \ncouldn’t get it out of my mind, though. What did it mean? What did any of it \nmean? \nIt took about a week of searching to find it again. To be honest, at the time I \ndidn’t even realise I was looking for it. I just found myself going further and \nfurther afield, retracing old routes for the sake of it, always with my music \ncranked up so loud I couldn’t hear the insects buzzing everywhere. I couldn’t \nhave told you why, not really, at least, not until I heard it again, that same \ntinny rendition of “The Skye Boat Song”. Then: \n“Four. Seven. Four. Nine.” \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 144 – Decrypted \n \n6 \n \nI stood there frozen for a moment, that strange feeling of doom returning in an \ninstant. I checked my iPod and, sure enough, the radio was off, and it said it \nwas playing a track called, ‘Numbers’. It was fainter than it had been before, \nthough, harder to pick out the exact numbers in the distortion and the quiet. \nSo, I began to walk again, this time paying close attention to the volume and \nclarity of the sound. \n \n“One. Six.” Fainter to the North. “Two. Eight.” Unchanged going South. “Three. \nZero.” Southeast was stronger. “One. Six.” But began to weaken again after a \nmile or so. “Five. Zero.” Much stronger around the eastern hill. “Four. Nine.” \nThere, the pylon, that was it. \nExcept obviously that wasn’t it. It wasn’t a broadcast tower and there was \nnothing in or around it that could possibly have been sending out any signal. It \nwas just a collection of old and twisted metal bars rising up into the half-\ncollapsed power tower. It must have been decades since it had been anything \nother than a decaying steel obelisk. Even if that hadn’t been the case, this \nwasn’t a broadcast, this was … This was inside my iPod. It would have to be \nsomething else, something cutting edge and new, but for miles around me was \nnothing but droning insects and dismal English summer. Nonetheless, when I \nstood in the centre of the hollow beneath that pylon’s rusted corpse, the \nnumbers came through crystal clear. \n“Five. Six. Four. Eight. Four. Six. Four. Seven. Four. Eight. Two. Seven.” \nWith each new number, my blood pounded and my heart raced, though I \ndidn’t have the faintest idea what they might have meant. I had actually \nbrought a notebook and pen, I now realised, just to write down the numbers.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 2, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 4229}}
