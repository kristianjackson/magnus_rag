Episode one hundred and fifty-\nfour: \"Bloody Mary.\" \n[Tape clicks on.] \nARCHIVIST \n(sigh) Hm. (sharp inhale) I’ve, uh, I’ve been doing a lot of thinking after what \nhappened with Daisy last week. About- what I can do. What I am. What feels- \nright. \nI found a- erm, I went back to Eli- Peter’s office, to that box of tapes, started \nrifling through. And I started to pay attention to the ones I.... wasn’t drawn to. \nThe tapes I instinctively wanted to discard. \nThere was one, this one, that my hand.... pulled back from. I dropped it, twice, \nwhen I went to pick it up. Even now, I’m... (slight quaver to his voice) \nstruggling to hit play. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 154 – Bloody Mary \nI am the avatar of awful knowledge and revealed secrets, so what does it not \nwant me to know? \n(Long sigh.) \n[Tape clicks off. Tape clicks on.] \nGERTRUDE \n(sharp sigh) Right. No use putting it off further. \n[We hear the rustle of paper.] \nGERTRUDE \n(Reading from the page.) \"When he opened his eyes, he saw nothing, but he \nheard her breathing, slow and steady and focused, and he immediately knew \nthat she was finally going to- (slight stumble) -kill him. When the garden \nshears plunged into his chest, he was surprised by how little actual pain there \nwas- just the sudden feeling of moisture on his chest and the realization that \nhis body was growing weak, fading away. \nHe wished she would say she was sorry she was doing this, that she loved him, \nthat she would miss him. But he knew better, and his final thought was a \ngentle sadness at how little he was surprised.\" \n[As she reads, a static begins, first a relatively standard crackling, that soon \nevolves into a deeper, more whooshing sound.] \nGERTRUDE (Cont.) \n(Reading) \"And so Eric Delano ended.\" \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 154 – Bloody Mary \n[The whooshing sound forms more clearly into a shaking breath.] \nGERTRUDE \nEric? \nERIC DELANO \nGertrude, I- Wha- What am I doing here? \n[Following every word he speaks is an echo.] \nGERTRUDE \nMary. She gave me your page. \nERIC \nShe!- Oh. \nGERTRUDE \nYes. Well. I’m sorry. \nERIC \nWasn’t even hard for her, was it? Handing me over? No sign of regret. \nGERTRUDE \n(Still a bit shaky) No. \nERIC \nNo. \nGERTRUDE \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 154 – Bloody Mary \nI’m sorry, Eric; I know this must be hard- I just read your death. I didn’t realize \nit would quite so… \nERIC \nYou should have seen what she did to my body afterwards. \nGERTRUDE \nDid you? \nERIC \nOh, yes. She bound me afterwards and made me watch. Don’t know why. \nWasn’t really in the best state to ask. Maybe she just wanted some company. \nGERTRUDE \nWhile she disposed of your body? \nERIC \nGod, I was a mess. I mean, part of me kind of suspected she’d killed before, but \nclearly she hadn’t done it enough to be a decent hand at chopping up and \ndumping bodies. She was having a real hard time of it. My legs were all over \nthe shop. (Long inhale) Would probably have been funny, if it hadn’t been me. \nGERTRUDE \nWhat’s it like? Being bound to the book? \nERIC \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 154 – Bloody Mary \nI don’t know how to describe it. Never was great with words. Bad. It feels bad. \nAll the time. I know that I’m not really Eric. I’m just a memory someone wrote \ndown. It hurts, most of the time. I don’t like it. \nGERTRUDE \nBut, you’re still here. \nERIC \nI suppose. Mary used to get me up to bounce ideas off of. Talk through her \nthoughts and theories. Never listened to me, obviously, but (light, pointed) \nnothing new there. \nGERTRUDE \nWell, it’s good to see you. I suppose. \nERIC \nYou too. (beat) You got old. \nGERTRUDE \nBetter than being dead. \nERIC \n(Short sigh of a laugh) Fair enough. To be honest, I’m impressed, more than \nanything. Hard to get old in this business. You either die, or you, uh, stay \nyoung. (short, uncomfortable pause) How did Mary look? \nGERTRUDE \n(same sort of short laugh) She got old, too.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 0, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 4119}}
