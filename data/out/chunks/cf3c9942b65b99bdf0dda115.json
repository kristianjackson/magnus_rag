We hurried down, and it was clear \neveryone else had already evacuated. We… had reached the \nground floor when… well… \nI… know I have often seemed dismissive of your concerns before, \nand in fact I was getting ready to raise the issue of Martin’s \ncontinuing to live in the Institute’s basement, especially as I believe \nhe’s been stealing fire extinguishers. But… honestly, I didn’t fully \nappreciate what you’d been talking about until I turned that corner \nand we saw what I can only describe as a… a tidal wave of filth \nrushing towards us. I feel somewhat ashamed to admit I didn’t \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG040 – Human Remains \n5 \n \nreally pay any attention to Sasha as I ran, and must have lost her at \nsome point. We became separated. \nI composed myself, and decided on a more roundabout route to the \nboiler room. Luckily it seemed the things were mainly concentrated \nin that one mass, leaving the other corridors largely vacant. It took \nme ten minutes, maybe fifteen, but I made it with only one close \ncall. The sight of rows and rows of huge, red CO2 canisters was \ncertainly something of a comfort. I do apologise that it took me \nquite so long to figure out how to actually work the system. If I’d \nbeen quicker... \nJONATHAN SIMS \nIt’s fine. \nWe’re alive. \nELIAS \nYes. Well. I turned on the fire suppression system. And… that’s \nwhen I heard the scream. I can’t really describe it but… well, I’m \nsure I don’t need to, you were a lot closer to it than I was. \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nIt’s the last thing I remember before blacking out. Tens of \nthousands of… things without mouths screaming as one. \n \nELIAS \nYes. Horrible sound. Anyway, I called the fire department, \nambulance and a contact at the ECDC who had previously been \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG040 – Human Remains \n6 \n \ninvolved in the Prentiss investigation. Once I was sure most of the \ngas would have dissipated, I headed down to the Archives to see \nwhat had happened. Sasha was already there, but you and Tim \nwere in a bad shape. It looked like a few dozen worms had been \ngoing into each of you when the carbon dioxide killed them. Was \nlike bloody Swiss che— \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nYes… thank you. I remember everything from when the ambulance \narrived. Quarantine, bandaging, et cetera. When did Martin get \nback? \n \nELIAS \nIt was about an hour after they’d taken you and Tim away. They \nwere prepping Prentiss’ corpse for disposal, when Martin burst out \nof that trapdoor you found, screaming that he’d found a body. So \nwe called the police. \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nTell me what happened to Gertrude Robinson. \nELIAS \nJohn, how many times do we need to go over this? \nJONATHAN SIMS \nWe’ve never got it on tape. \nELIAS \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG040 – Human Remains \n7 \n \nYou can barely stand. Just… why don’t we just do this tomorrow? \n… \nFine. \nJONATHAN SIMS \nOn the 15th of March last year, I had a query about a statement \none of our researchers was after and went down to the \nArchives. Gertrude wasn’t there, but her desk was covered in \nblood. I called the police, and there was a huge search, but \nthere no sign was found of Gertrude, alive or dead. She didn’t \nhave any assistants, so there were no witnesses, and no-one \nsaw or heard anything. The police tested the blood and \nconfirmed the DNA matched to Gertrude, though I don’t know \nwhy they had her on file. They judged there to be almost a \ngallon of blood spilled, far more than the human body can lose \nand survive, so I assumed she was dead and left the \ninvestigation to the police, for all that good it did me. And I \nappointed another archivist. \n \nMartin finding her body in the tunnels is as much a mystery to me \nas it is to you. \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nRight. Right. Thank you, Elias. \nStatement ends. \n \n \nCan you send in Tim? \n \n \n[CLICK]", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 1, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 3894}}
