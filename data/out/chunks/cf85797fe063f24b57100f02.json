I asked when this had started, and she told me it was \nafter she had moved out of her college halls and into a house on Bullingdon \nRoad with her friends. I suggested that perhaps it had something to do with \nthe stresses of entering second year, but she insisted it was something to do \nwith the house. Finally, after several discussions, I agreed to look over the \nhouse and perform a small blessing in case there was anything wrong with the \nplace, spiritually speaking. \nIt was a cold morning in December, near the end of Michaelmas term, when I \nvisited 89 Bullingdon Road. It was an old house, though not so old as to be \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG019 – Confession \n5 \n \nunusual in that part of Oxford, and had clearly once been a small family house, \nnow partitioned by the lettings agency to house as many students as possible. \nBethany told me that there were six of them living there at the time. I went \naround the house, looking for signs of anything amiss but found nothing that \nseemed out of the ordinary. Bethany kept asking me if I “felt any evil” in the \nhouse, and I tried to explain to her that priests unfortunately don’t have the \npower to simply sense the presence of evil. I didn’t realise how unfortunate \nthat was, at least not until we got her room. It was on the first floor at the back \nof the house, and was a long, thin bedroom, easily the biggest. It was adorned \nin typical student fashion with movie posters and flat-pack bookshelves, but \nmy attention was immediately taken by a large patch of wall where the \nwallpaper had been crudely hacked away to reveal the bare brickwork \nunderneath. Written there, in faded blue paint, was a single word: Mentis. \nI’d been out of seminary for some years at this point, and had never been one \nfor the Latin Mass, but I still knew the word for ‘mind’. My immediate \nassumption was that Bethany had painted it in some sort of mania, but looking \ncloser I saw that the paint was far too old to have been done since she moved \nin. It looked more as though it had been painted on the wall and then covered \nup with layers of wallpaper over the years, until finally being unearthed by \nstripping it away. What was slightly more concerning, was that watching \nBethany pace around the room, following my gaze with some confusion, was \nthat she didn’t seem able to see it. When I asked her what the word on the \nwall meant to her, she looked at me as though I was talking nonsense. \nI didn’t seem like there was much more to be gained there at that point, so I \nperformed a short blessing over the place, took some photographs and told \nBethany that I would have to come back later once I’d looked into a few things.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 2, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 2901}}
