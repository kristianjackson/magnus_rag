By that point I was \npretty much convinced that whatever was going on with Cook was outside the \narea of the natural, and that usually traced back to one of the items I was \ncarrying for sale. The fact that I’d just given something to Cook, well it tracked \ntoo closely for me to not come to some… obvious conclusions. \nI started to avoid eating the meat I was served, kept my feeding to the small \nportion of vegetables that he’d add to the side, more a garnish than anything \nelse. It didn’t escape my notice that Cook was also hiding increasing amounts \nof his arm inside his coat when he spoke to me. \n\nFirst fingers, then the hand, then finally he kept the whole forearm tucked \nunder his jacket so I couldn’t get a decent look. When I thought about it I’d get \nvisions of Cook slowly reaching in, cranking the handle wildly with the other \narm, while he pushed his skin and flesh into the whirring iron, mouth open and \nsmiling, as it began to come through the mincer grate like a string of meaty \nbubbles. It made me feel ill, but I just couldn’t get it out of my head. \nSo a few days out of port I snuck into the galley when he wasn’t in. I mean, it \nwas my ship, so I shouldn’t have felt like a thief sneaking around, but I did. \nSecured over the hobs was a bubbling pot of water that Cook was gradually \nturning into stock. At first I didn’t know what was it that made me so \nuncomfortable about the sight. Then I realised that he was making it the same \nway you make most meat stocks: he was boiling up some bones. And I am a \nhundred percent certain that Leigh did not supply us with bones, especially not \nthe sort of bones I was seeing in that pot. \nThe meat grinder was there, clamped onto the side, a ways away from the \nmain counter, and with no sign that it had ever been used. But there was \nsomething to it that alarmed me. When it had been in the box it was old, rust \ncreeping at the edges. Not something you’d want to put raw meat through. But \nnow the thing was spotless, like new, and as I got closer that… same smell that \nwafted off Cook got stronger and stronger. \nNow I’m not one for hiding, or dodging a confrontation, but if this was \nhappening like I thought, I really wanted to catch Cook in the act, see exactly \nwhat he was doing. So I went, and I waited until he was in the kitchen, \npreparing dinner, and I just walked in. Well, I tried to walk in, but Cook had \nlocked the door. I had my own key of course, but I was also aware of how \nflimsy the lock was, so in the interest of time, I just kicked it open. \n\nIn many ways what I found in there was exactly what I expected, but in other \nways... I don’t know. Cook did have his right arm up to the elbow in the mincer, \nhis left hand working the crank, around and around. I could hear the sound of \nbone and flesh grinding, but there was nothing coming out the other end of \nthe machine. Then I saw what was lying on the counter. It was his arm, neatly \nsliced off and butchered into cuts of meat, the bone shining white through the \nblood and dark skin. And I remembered he’d promised us pork chop tonight. \nLooking back at Cook, I saw the ecstasy on his face, with just a hint of manic \nterror, as he turned the crank, and a new arm came out, bit by bit, raw and \nglistening. It didn’t look like his old one, but there was a part of me sure it \nwould taste just the same. \nIt didn’t look like he’d even noticed me breaking through the door. He was \nwrapped up in his own sickness. So I walked over and grabbed him by the \nshoulder, screaming to know what the hell he thought he was doing. That \nsnapped him out of it alright, and he lunged at me with a sudden cry, ripping \nthe lower part of his arm back off, and leaving it sitting there, ragged in the \ngrinder. His left hand went to the boiling stock, blistering and peeling as Cook \nreached in and pulled out one of the larger bones, swinging it wildly about the \nplace. I don’t speak any Croatian, but given the way he was salivating I’m \npretty sure he chanting something about dinner. \nBut in the end, he only had one arm, and wasn’t thinking properly. His \nmovements were clumsy, like a drunk, and even at his best I’ve killed worse \nthan Cook. He went down easy. That’s another good thing about having a crew \nyou can trust. They tossed him overboard, and cleaned up without asking any \nsort of prying questions. Of course they belly-ached about another we", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 2, "chunk_count": 5, "chars": 4500}}
