The Magnus Archives. Episode one hundred and ninety-\ntwo: \"An Appointment.\" \n[Theme finishes] \n[Tape clicks on] \n[Water drips and drains in a damp, echoing tunnel location] \n[Martin, Georgie, and the Archivist stand] \nMARTIN \nSo this is it? \nJust up those stairs? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 192 – An Appointment \n \n2 \nGEORGIE \nJust? You’ve seen how tall that tower is, right? \nARCHIVIST \nWe don’t have much of a choice. \nMARTIN \nYeah, but still, it’s just walking, though, isn’t it? And god knows we’ve had \nenough practice. How come you haven’t had a look yourselves? \nGEORGIE \nKeep watching. \n[Grit, stone, and movement noises as Georgie stoops to grab a \npebble] \nYou see those? \nMARTIN \nWhat— Oh. Oh… ah. Are those… corpses? \nGEORGIE \nI wish. Watch. \n[Georgie throws the pebble; as it rattles into a larger space there \nare many breathy moans and much excited movement] \nMARTIN \n(Alarmed) Ah! Aaah. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 192 – An Appointment \n \n3 \nGEORGIE \nShh! \n[The excited noises calm, but some shuffling and breathy moans \nstill continue] \nMARTIN \nRight. So these are the, uh… ‘former archivists’ you were talking about, John? \nARCHIVIST \nYes. \nMARTIN \nI don’t like them. \nARCHIVIST \nNo. \nMARTIN \nSo what do we do? How do we get past them? \nGEORGIE \nDunno. It was never worth risking it. \nMARTIN \nWait, seriously? I thought you had this whole ‘invisibility cloak’ thing going on? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 192 – An Appointment \n \n4 \nGEORGIE \nSure, but I’m not exactly keen to test it against the eyeball tower guardians. I \ndon’t know the limits of our ‘invisibility’, and it seems pretty dumb to saunter \nup and hope it works on them. \n(Martin makes a puffing exhale) \nMARTIN \nRight. \nGEORGIE \nLook. I’ve taken you this far. Beyond this point you’re on your own, alright? \nMARTIN \nNo advice at all? \nGEORGIE \nI… I dunno. Believe in yourself? \nMARTIN \nWow. Thanks. \nARCHIVIST \nIt’s alright, Martin. They’ll let us through. \nMARTIN \nYou’re sure? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 192 – An Appointment \n \n5 \nARCHIVIST \nYes. \nMARTIN \nI thought you weren’t so good at knowing down here? What if, what if you’re \nwrong and then we’re absolu— \nARCHIVIST \nI’m not. \nTrust me. \nThank you Georgie. \nGEORGIE \nSure. \nGood luck. \nARCHIVIST \nThank you. \nAnd tell Melanie... Tell her I’m sorry. \nGEORGIE \nThat’s… not what she wants to hear from you. \nARCHIVIST \nWell then… what does she want? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 192 – An Appointment \n \n6 \nGEORGIE \nI don’t know. But… it’s not going to be another apology. \nARCHIVIST \nFine. Tell her I— \nGEORGIE \n(Hiding concern) Look. Tell her yourself when you get back down, okay? I’m \nnot your bloody P.A. Anything you’ve got to say to me, that can wait too. \nARCHIVIST \nOkay. \nLet’s go Martin. \nMARTIN \nBye Georgie. \n[Footsteps as they start walking] \nGEORGIE \nGood luck. \n[Hissing static starts] \nARCHIVIST \nCeaseless Watcher, see your servants approach. Herald their arrival and bid \nthem welcome into your sanctum. \n[As the Archivist speaks the former archivists react with moans \nthen become still] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 192 – An Appointment \n \n7 \n[Hissing static ends] \nMARTIN \nEr… yeah… excuse us. \n[Tape clicks off] \n[Tape clicks on] \n[Martin and the Archivist are climbing stairs; their feet and voices \necho in way that suggests a tall, marbled space; cameras iris \nmovements and faint whispers are audible; a faint pulsing tone \npermeates the background; and distant muffled helicopter and \ndrone sounds] \n(Laboured breathing from Martin) \nMARTIN \nOkay, okay, hold… hold up. H-Hold on. Hold on, hold on. \n[The Archivist’s quick footsteps continue] \nOi, John! \nARCHIVIST \n(Softly) Oh, right. \n[Martin stops; the Archivist returns to him] \nMARTIN \nJust wait a sec— Christ, I just need a moment to… catch my breath.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 0, "chunk_count": 9, "chars": 4258}}
