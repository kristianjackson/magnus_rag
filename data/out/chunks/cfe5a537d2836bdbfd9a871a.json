The door closes.] \nOLIVER \nUm… hello, John. Do you mind if I call you John? I, I mean, you don’t actually \nknow me, it’s just... well, ‘Archivist’ it’s so formal, isn't it, and I do kind of know \nyou? Haven’t had much choice, really. Dreams are like that, you know. No \nmatter how lucid you think they are, there’s always that part that just drags \nyou along. \nGuess I don’t need to tell you that. At least, not right now. \n(Sighs) Wish I could tell you why I came here. Wish I knew why I came here. \nSuppose there’s only so long you can dream about someone, and not at least \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 121 – Far Away \n \n2 \n \ntry to find them. That was it with the old woman, too. That was different, \nthough. Way I figure it, she stuck her nose in just about everywhere it wasn't \nwanted and stirred up hornets ‘til all the precautions in the world couldn’t stop \ndeath from finally catching her. If I’d known more back then, I’m not sure I’d \nhave bothered trying to warn her. Still, you live and learn, don’t you? \nSorry to go on. I don’t talk to many people these days. Putting my thoughts \noutside myself, it gets a bit… clumsy. Be easier if you could talk back, right? Ask \nme questions, and just have it tumble all out? But no, it’s… it’s just me. Wish \nthere was a better way, but touching someone's mind, it's not as simple as \nthat, is it? Doesn’t always make things clearer, you know? \nStill, I gave the old woman a statement, so maybe I owe you one as well? \nThat’s how it works, right? Give you a terror; give you a dream? It’s not like I \ndon’t have them to spare. \nHmmm. Let me tell you about how I tried to escape. \nOLIVER (STATEMENT) \nSo, my name is Oliver Banks. In my other statements I used the name Antonio \nBlake, but I don’t really think either name has much meaning for me anymore. \nIt’s been almost ten years since I first started dreaming about the deaths of \nothers; seeing those awful veins crawling into them, into wounds not yet open \nor skulls not yet split. People who are about to die. Every night I watch as they \nsnake up and into throats about to choke on blood or merging into hearts \nabout to convulse. \nI’ve… come to terms with it. \n(Bitter chuckle) I’ve learned to live with it. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 121 – Far Away \n \n3 \n \nBut about two years before I came to your Institute, something happened, \nsomething I didn’t want to talk about, didn’t even want to think about. \nI… started to see them when I was awake. \nIt was subtle at first, so quick I could pretend I hadn’t seen. Just second of \nthem webbed over the face of a drunk old man stumbling to his car. A chain \nsmoker exhales, and just for a second I catch one dangling from his mouth \nbefore it slithers back inside. Crossing a bridge and I might see one snaking \nalong the road and over towards the railing. \nLooking back now I feel like an idiot, trying to pretend I was imagining it, that I \nwas just tired or whatever bull I told myself. It started to happen more often, \nand I began to avoid the places that I visited in my dreams. I sort of knew, you \nsee, that not all of the cords would have faded when I woke up. \nI still remember the first time I tried to touch one. In my dreams the night \nbefore, I had found my way back to my own street. I don’t know why I did it. I \nknew it was a stupid thing to do, walking past my own home in a dream, but I \njust... Maybe I wanted it this way. I mean, when I stepped out the building that \nmorning, I didn’t turn towards the bus stop, like I always do. I turned right \ninstead, and walked over toward the little alleyway where I knew, sometime in \nthe next week, a young woman was going to have a fatal aneurysm. \nAnd there they were, on the concrete, like a starburst of fleshy roots, \nspreading and reaching out from the spot where her head was going to hit the \nground. They moved just like in the dreams, throbbing and pulsing. I had to \ntake a moment, just to be sure, just to be completely sure that I was awake. \nFelt like I was staring at it for hours, but I don’t think it was much more than a \nfew minutes. They didn’t fade,", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 0, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 4500}}
