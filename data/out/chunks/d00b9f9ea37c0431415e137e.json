Firstly, we wanted to take a moment to thank \neveryone who helped us get here; all the cast, crew, volunteers, fans, and \nfriends we’ve had working with us over the years. Making something on this \nscale is only ever possible when a huge number of dedicated people work \ntogether, and we never could have made it all the way to episode 200 without \neveryone involved. So thank you. Secondly, we wanted to thank you, the \nlistener. If you’re hearing this then you have probably listened to a lot of The \nMagnus Archives. It has been an honour, coming on this journey with you and \nwe hope you’ll stick around and join us on other shows across the RQ network. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 200 – Last Words \n2 \nThirdly, you may be wondering what happens with Magnus now. Well, no need \nto panic, we still have a whole roster of post-season content to come out via \nour normal release schedule, along with additional Patreon content and other \nthings besides. Not only that, but from 5pm GMT, Thursday 25th of March, \nthat’s pretty much right now if you’re listening to this at release, we are going \nto be streaming a little digital shindig as some cast and crew drop by to \ncelebrate the end of the show. So be sure to check that out at \ntwitch.tv/rusty_quill . That’s all for now. Thank you so much from everyone at \nRusty Quill and we hope you enjoy the final instalment of The Magnus \nArchives. \n \n[The Magnus Archives Theme – Intro] \nJONATHAN SIMS \nRusty Quill presents...
