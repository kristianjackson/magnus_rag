I-I’m grossly \noversimplifying, of course, but I don’t care. I don’t think Danielle did very well \nin her exams. \nI remember the night she told me about zombies. It was dark outside and must \nhave been late. It was high summer, and the days were long and sweltering. \nOur building really kept the heat and had very few opening windows, so even \nin the evening that humid warmth seemed to stick around. One of our \nhousemates, Liam, was sat at the other end of the living room, playing some \nobnoxious videogame. He had the lights at that end of the room turned off, \nand the screen lit up his blank, gormless face as he stared at some space \nmonster or other that he had to kill. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 122 – Zombie \n \n13 \n \n \nDanielle explained that a philosophical zombie is someone who outwardly \ndisplays all the signs of life and consciousness – they talk, they laugh, they \nscream, they even appear to think – but they have no inner life at all, no actual \nsubjective experience. It’s all a ruse, a conjuring trick. If you cut them, they’d \nbleed, they might even cry out, but they wouldn’t actually feel any pain, \nbecause they can’t actually feel anything. It’s all just an act. \nI said to Danielle, “Like Liam?” and she laughed at what she assumed was a \nfunny joke, and tried to explain it again. Told me they weren’t real, that it was \nall a thought experiment, and the fact that you could imagine them was \nsupposed to counter some other philosopher who sounded equally \nmeaningless. But like I said, I don’t think she got a very good grade, and, \nlooking at Liam, blankly staring into that glowing square on the wall, I knew \nthat she was wrong. They were real. His eyes were so dark and dull, empty \nwindows to a soul that he didn’t really have. \nI started to do some experiments on him – not many, just a few little ones here \nand there – to see. I suppose you might have called them cruel, if Liam was \ncapable of suffering. He certainly pretended to cry out in pain when I \n‘accidentally’ cut his hand while chopping onions, and he did a good \nimpression of grief when his fish died. But his eyes were always the same – \ncold and empty. \nI didn’t do anything about it, obviously. What would have been the point? \nThere was no real harm in him going out into the world, pretending to live his \nlife. It was no skin off my nose, certainly. It wasn’t just him, though; there were \nso many more of them out there. At one point, I did legitimately entertain the \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 122 – Zombie \n \n14 \n \nnotion that they might all be zombies. Everyone. That it was just me, that I was \nthe only real person that existed. But no, that wasn’t right. It was just certain \npeople. I’d watch them, and see their reactions, the emotions they didn’t quite \nget right, and I knew they were a façade. \nIt became like a game to me, watching out for those soulless husks. Whether \non the bus, the street or even meeting a client for work, I would look into their \neyes for just a second and see the emptiness inside. I tried to make it a game, \nat least. Truth was they scared me very deeply. What were they? How did it \nhappen? Were they born hollow, or did something scoop them out and leave \nthem like that? And the question that kept me up, staring into the darkness \nlate at night: why did it seem like I was the only one able to see them? \nI saw so many people, real people, chatting with these ‘zombies’, talking to \nthem as if they were able to understand what was being said to them, rather \nthan simply pretending. How was it that they couldn’t see the quiet void that \nlurked behind each of their smiles? And there seemed to be more and more of \nthem every day. Sometimes I found myself utterly alone, facing down a room \nfull of nothing eyes, willing myself to take action. I never did, though, not even \nwhen one of them started following me. \nI first saw him in the street. It wasn’t difficult to guess what he was, half the \npeople around him were just as hollow and soulless, but there was something \nelse to him. He was tall, but not so tall as to stick out; thin, but not unhealthily \nso. He wore a blue T-shirt, despite the falling temperature, and his short, dark \nhair and pale skin surrounded a smile so fake it practically glowed. He stared at \nme as I walked past, not making a move to follow or stop me, nor did his eyes \nseem to actually move. It was like one of those paintings that watch you.
