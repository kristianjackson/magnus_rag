She had \nalways been very religious, although since most of the churches I visited were \npicked for their design, they tended to be Catholic or Orthodox, and I’m not \nsure how happy she’d have been about my lighting a candle for her in them. \nStill, at the end of the day, I did it for me, not for her. She’s gone. There isn’t \nanything but us. \nAnyway, when a deal came up in the middle of October for five days in \nIstanbul, I jumped on it. I’d heard a lot of lovely things about the city itself, but \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 130 – Meat \n5 \n \nmore importantly, I’d just been reading a brilliant series of articles on early \nschisms in the church, specifically the various gnostic sects that started \nspringing up around the 4th Century, many located in what was then \nConstantinople and is now Istanbul. Do you know about Gnosticism? It’s a sort \nof dualism that places the purity and goodness of the spiritual world in \nopposition to the baseness and corruption of the material world. Some gnostic \nmovements even go so far as to posit the existence of the demiurge, a \ncounterpoint to the God of the spiritual world, who created material existence \nas a warped, imperfect imitation of its purity. Everything that is base, corrupt \nand vile in the physical world comes from them. If God, as Gnostics see him, is \nthe God of the soul, then the demiurge could easily be called the god of the \nflesh. Of bone and blood. Of meat. \nI had read about an old gnostic temple some miles outside of Istanbul, and \ndecided to make a short trip out to see it. When I got there though, it was \nnothing but a disappointment. What the artfully lit photos had shown as stark \nand ancient, were in person just empty and old. Whatever decoration there \nmight once have been had long since worn away, and only the occasional \nplastic tourist signs indicated it had ever been a place of worship. Whatever \npeace I was looking for, I wasn’t going to find it there. It was barely more than \na ruin. More than that, I seemed to be almost entirely alone. There’d been an \nold woman coming out of it when I arrived, but I hadn’t seen anyone apart \nfrom her, not even at the ticketing booth. As I wandered the small building, I \nbecame more and more aware of the quiet, and of the wind that blew gently \nthrough the empty windows. \nI did my best to shrug off the growing feeling of unease that had settled over \nme and walked back outside. The taxi that had taken me had long since \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 130 – Meat \n6 \n \ndeparted and the temple stood alone, some distance from any other inhabited \nbuilding. The afternoon was wearing on, and I didn’t fancy trying to walk all the \nway back to my hotel, but my initial plan of asking a staff member to call me \nanother taxi was somewhat scuppered by their absence. As I was considering \nmy options, I heard the roar of an engine, and looked over to see a heavy-\nlooking truck slowly rolling down the street towards me. It had no obvious \nmarkings and the back of it was covered with a grey tarp. For some reason, it \nfilled me with the most intense dread I’ve ever felt, and I found myself \nstepping back, behind a pillar, desperately hoping I was out of sight. \nThe truck pulled around the side of the building, and I heard the engine stop. I \ncrept forward, still not sure why I had such an instinctive terror of what \nseemed on the surface to be a perfectly normal vehicle, but as three men \nclimbed out of the front and started to walk back towards the covered load, I \nstarted to realise I could smell something – damp, slightly sour, with the \nfaintest hint of iron. I realised what it was, a moment before the tarpaulin fell \nand revealed the huge pile of pink and white and brown. At first, I thought the \nbodies were all human, that perhaps I had somehow stumbled upon some sort \nof gang, disposing of a massacre’s worth of corpses. But then some of them \nstarted to move. Squirming limbs were dragging, rising, extracting themselves \nfrom this mound of flesh and making their way down to join their companions \non the ground, one by one. Most of them could still be mistaken for human at \na distance; a few even wore clothes. No-one said a word. \nAfter a minute or so, it looked like everything that was going to climb down off \nthe truck had done so.
