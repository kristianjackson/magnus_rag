Is that a voice, calling sweetly from beyond the iron gate, \ntelling you that it has something to show you, secrets that it wishes to share? \n[Footsteps stop; something else moves nearby, followed by faint \nsounds of sone scraping; then footsteps resume] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nJust knock and ask to enter. Or try your best not to hear, to think nothing but \ngood and admirable thoughts of those who wait in monuments to their own \nvirtue. There now, a face, pale and stained with age and death and sin— \n[Fervent rattle of chains] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \n—no, not sin, never sin. Misjudgement. Indiscretion. Misunderstanding. \n[Stone scrapes and undead vocalisations] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 180 – Moving On \n12 \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nNever sin. Never evil. It grins and smiles and nods its head, with broken yellow \nteeth. It is a smile that wants you closer, wants you near. A bloated, purple \ntongue that tries to whisper reassurance, but can only gurgle promises that \nsmell like sour fruit. \n[Footsteps resume; the background now with more undead noises, \nchain clinks, and stone scrapes] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nHow big is this place? How many miles of eerie edifice stand between you and \nfreedom. Some doors lie cracked, shattered outwards, their occupants kept in \ncheck by ancient chains binding their brittle, bony limbs. Don’t go too close, \nkeep to the middle of the narrowing alley. The stench that rolls from these \nbroken crypts is unlike anything you have ever known, like lakes of fly-blown \nblood left to bake in the unrelenting sun. Keep it to yourself, though. Don’t \nmention it. No point making a scene. The angels wouldn’t like it. Besides, those \nare the tombs with the longest epitaphs, so they must have been good people. \nWatch for the stones, the ones beneath your feet that sink and shift on the \nswampy ground. With every step their firmness seems more and more a \nquestion, and the cracks that cut across them grow deeper and deeper. Don’t \nstep on the cracks, or goodness knows what will happen. And you are \nsurrounded by goodness, are you not? \nYour steps are as quick as respect will allow, and echo dutifully down the \navenues. How much further to the gates? \n[Sounds caused by the undead begin to fade away] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 180 – Moving On \n13 \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nHow much longer must you watch your every thought, lest it bring a sneer to \nyour lips the angels might take as scorn. It must be close, simply turn at the \nnext crypt and you should see it. \n[Distant sound of a crowd murmuring; footsteps slow then halt] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nWait. No. That isn’t right. There should be the gates, the threshold to leave \nthese silent rows, but instead what rises in front of you is a house, tall and \nangular, with jagged peaks of darked wood, and windows from which no light \nescapes. It calls itself a home, but it lies. The funeral home houses only the \npassing congregations of sycophants and weepers, desperate to cleanse their \nown iniquities in the salt-tinged flood of gloating tears. You turn to walk away, \nto hurry back and disappear into the tombs that now seem almost welcoming, \nwhen behind you comes the inescapable, the inevitable sound of an old \nwooden door being opened. \n[Door creaks open] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \n‘Come in,’ the Funeral Director intones, ‘the service is about to begin. You are \nexpected.’ \nThe faceless gaze of each sepulchre angel fixes itself upon you, and you feel \nyourself turning back towards the house, though every muscle in your body \nscreams at you to run. Instead you nod, and apologise for your lateness. The \nangels look away. And you step across the threshold. \n[The crowd fades, replaced by the sound of close, upset breathing]", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 2, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 3756}}
