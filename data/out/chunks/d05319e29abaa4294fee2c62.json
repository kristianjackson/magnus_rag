It appeared to be… a woman. She was \nfacing away from me, apparently staring at the corner of the wall. Her hair was \nlong and black, though it was so twisted and dirty it was hard to tell if that was \nits original colour. She wore a threadbare grey overcoat, though beneath it her \nlegs were bare, and covered with what I at first I thought were spots. In her \nright hand she held a stained, green handkerchief. She stood there, totally still, \neither not noticing the torchlight that was shining on her, or not caring. \nI didn't move a muscle. Then, with a quick, jerky movement she brought the \nhandkerchief to her face and coughed. I mean, I call it a cough, because that's \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG022 – Colony \n7 \n \nwhat it looked like, but it didn't sound like a cough. It was more like... like… you \nknow in a nature documentary, w-when the lion’s caught something and it’s, \nit’s ripping it apart? That noise of wet meat…? Yeah, it was, was like that. I saw \nsomething drop from the handkerchief onto the floor. It was about an inch \nlong, silver, and it wriggled as it fell. I screamed. I’m not ashamed to admit it, \nthough looking back I really wish I hadn’t. \nHer head snapped towards me and she locked eyes with me. Her pupils \nseemed ragged and collapsed, and when she smiled her teeth were chipped \nand blackened. I started to stagger backwards, expecting at any moment for \nher to lunge at me, but instead she slowly reached up and… let the overcoat \nfall to the floor. Her skin was pale, almost grey, and full of… sorry, it still makes \nme sick to think about it. It was full of holes. Deep, black holes just \nhoneycombing every bit of flesh like a… wasps’ nest. I could see those… thin, \nsilver worms crawling in and out, and their black tips twitching as they \nsquirmed through that… pitted… meat. I mean, it wasn’t human. It can’t have \nbeen. \nSh-She… It took a step towards me and as it did so the worms began to writhe \nout of every hole and cavity, falling to the floor in a cascading… wave and \nstarting to crawl towards me with… with alarming speed. I had the oddest \nthought, then, and even as I backed away towards the stairs, I started to get \nmy phone out. The daft thing is I wasn’t even going to call anyone for help, I \njust wanted to take a picture of the thing. To prove to you that it happened – \nyou’re always so quick to dismiss these statements and I wanted proof for you. \nExcept, well, I managed to drop it, of course. Just as I was bringing up the \ncamera app, one of the worm-things reached at me and leapt at my face. That \nthing jumped literally 6 feet through the air at my face. It missed me, but I was \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG022 – Colony \n8 \n \nso taken aback that I fell onto the stairs behind me, and dropped my phone to \nthe ground. \nI-I didn’t stop to pick it up, I just fled up the stairs as fast as I could. Obviously \nthe door at the top wasn’t locked. If it had been… I’m sure I’d be dead. Or… \nworse. I ran faster than I ever have in my life – I’ve never been good at running \n– and every moment expected to feel something wriggling up my leg. I didn’t \nstop running until I was sat in the Underground and had checked every inch of \nmy seat for worms. \nI live in Stockwell, right at the other end of the Northern Line, so by the time I \ngot home I was… starting to feel a bit safer… though utterly exhausted. I knew \nthat there was no way I was going to be able to work the next day, but without \nmy phone I couldn’t let you know. I mean I don’t have a landline – who does \nanymore – but couldn’t bring myself to stay awake long enough to send an \nemail, so I just collapsed, fully clothed onto the bed. I don’t know how long I \nslept for, but it was still dark when the knocking woke me up. I don’t know if it \nwas the same night, or if I’d slept right through the day. Either way, I dragged \nmyself up and, as I sat there, it all came back to me, what I’d seen, and I \nshuddered. \nI tried to tell myself I’d imagined it. Maybe I’d overreacted to finding a \nhomeless woman sleeping in the basement. Maybe she was sick and needed \nan ambulance. Oh god, maybe I’d left her to die. There was more knocking and \nI reached up to flick the light on. But when I did so nothing happened. I tried \nthe lamp next to my bed, but again, nothing. Looking around I saw that none of \nmy electronics seemed to be on. There must have been some sort of power \ncut. Again, someone knocked at the door. Maybe it was one of my \nneighbour", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 4, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 4499}}
