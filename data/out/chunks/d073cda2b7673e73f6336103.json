This was a \nparticularly bad squeeze. Near the end it got so bad that, if Alena hadn’t gone \nin first, I would have told her to go back and forget Lost John’s Cave. \nAbout half way through I realised that it was far tighter than I had imagined. I \ncalled ahead, to make sure Alena had made it out okay. She called back, told \nme it was a hard one, but she was fine. I wanted to answer her, but by that \npoint the rock was so close around me it was stopping me from doing anything \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG015 – Lost John’s Cave \n6 \n \nbut holding my breath and willing myself forward. A hand grasped me firmly \non the shoulder and pulled me through. Just like that, I was out. Alena gave me \na smirk, as if to comment on the fact that she had made it through unassisted \nand I, the true cave aficionado, had need a hand. I wanted to shoot back some \npointed comment about her being more slender than me, but by the time I had \ngot my breathing under control again, the anger had died down and I managed \na weak smile. \nWe made our way through the cave until we came to the Cathedral. It’s a \nlarge, arching cave – quite breathtaking, though it requires a couple of sheer \ndrops to access, one of about 40 feet. We had experience and equipment \nenough to make quite light work of it though, and soon we were beneath the \nCathedral in what is imaginatively called the Crypt. We stopped here for a rest \nand a bite to eat, and Alena told me an interesting thing about Lost John’s \nCave. While I had been concerned with finding maps and as much information \nas I could on getting through, she told me she had been looking into a history \nof the place. \nShe said everyone puts the apostrophe in the wrong place when talking about \nLost John’s Cave, as the stories goes it was two men, both named John, who \nwere the first to delve deep into the cave. They went too far, though, and their \ncandles had gone out. They lost their way together in the sprawling labyrinth \nof tunnels and never emerged. Alena said she thought it was quite sweet, in a \nstrange sort of way, and joked that if she ever got trapped underground, she’d \nwant it to be with me. I smiled and nodded, though secretly the thought \nappalled me. It wasn’t at the thought of being entombed down there – at the \ntime it didn’t seem like such an awful fate – but the thought of having to spend \nmy last days with Alena was a bit too much. I’m sorry, that’s a horrible thing to \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG015 – Lost John’s Cave \n7 \n \nsay about the dead. I loved my sister, and I loved spending time with her, but \nto be lost beneath the earth is such an intensely private thing. Maybe she \nrealised that, at the end. \nAfter our brief stop we made our way down through the Dome. It was \nbeautiful, and this was the part that I had been dreading, as all the experienced \ncavers I had talked to had said that this was the hardest descent. It went easily. \nVery easily, actually, and at the time I remember getting a weird feeling, like I \nwas being swallowed. Finally, we made it through the shale cavern and into the \nmaster cave. As we stood there, I felt anticipation and trepidation in equal \nmeasure. Before us lay the passage, filled with the still water of the sump. We \nwere about to have our first cave dive. \nI had always been told by experienced cave divers that you never judge the \ndistance correctly. The first few times you try to surface, you will always hit \nyour head on the stone above, so it’s best to try and not be too alarmed by it. I \nreminded Alena of this as we got our equipment ready, and she told me she \nremembered, and then surprised me by asking to be the first one to go \nthrough, saying something or other about conquering fears. I said yes, why \nnot, and let her go through. As I stood there alone, waiting, I began to feel \nsomething I had never before felt this far underground. I began to feel uneasy. \nIt was as silent as it had ever been, but there was something else there, \nbeneath the silence. Almost like a whisper. \nI shook the feeling off when it came time to follow Alena, and dived into the \npool. It wasn’t far to the junction which would lead us on to the Gavel Pot. I \npressed myself through the narrow space, half swimming, half climbing, until I \nthought I had gone far e", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 3, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 4498}}
