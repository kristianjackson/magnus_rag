If you’re so keen to take everything, undo the work of centuries, \nit’s just through that door. \n[Footsteps] \nBASIRA \nJohn? \nARCHIVIST \n(Compelling) How dangerous is it? \nMANUELA \nOnly myself, Maxwell and Natalie could even look upon it.

I just need to see it. \nBASIRA \nSee, as in … \nARCHIVIST \nAs in, actually see it. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 143 – Heart of Darkness \n \n15 \n \nMANUELA \nGo ahead. Just try. \nBASIRA \nLook, it’s alright, John. No-one else knows it’s here, and if we just leave it, no-\none will know. \nARCHIVIST \nNo, I’m doing this.

I thought you might like a way home. \nARCHIVIST \nAnother door? \nHELEN \nIf you want it. \n… \nHow was it, looking upon The Dark? \nARCHIVIST \nI thought I was going to die. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 143 – Heart of Darkness \n \n18 \n \nHELEN \nYou seem to think that a lot.
