There was no \nsign of the thing I’d seen climb in, but as the police pressed the buzzer outside \nhis building, I saw someone walking towards the door to let them in. It wasn’t \nGraham. \nI can’t stress enough how much this was not Graham. He looked completely \ndifferent. He was maybe a few inches shorter and had a long, square face \ntopped with curly blond hair, where Graham’s had been dark and cut short. He \nwas dressed in Graham’s clothes, though; I recognised the shirt from my \nmonths of watching, but he was not Graham. I watched as Not Graham walked \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG003 – Across The Street \n11 \n \nto the door and let the two police officers in. They talked for a while, and Not \nGraham looked concerned and together they started to search the flat. I \nwatched, waiting for the thing to emerge, or for them to find the real Graham, \nbut they didn’t. At one point I saw one of the police pick up a dark red shape \nthat I recognised as a passport. My heart beat faster as a saw her open it and \nlook at Not-Graham, clearly comparing, waiting for the moment when she \ndetected the impostor. But instead she just laughed, shook Not Graham’s \nhand, and they left. I watched the police car drive away, feeling a sense of \nhelplessness, and when I looked up, he was standing at Graham’s window, \nlooking back at me. I stood there frozen as his wide, staring eyes met mine and \na cold, toothy smile spread across his face. Then in one swift motion he drew \nthe curtains, and was gone. \nI didn’t sleep that night, and I never saw Graham again. I saw this new person, \nthough, all the time. For the next week I’d see him taking out large, heavy-\nlooking rubbish bags several times a day. It took me a while to realise he was \ndisposing of Graham’s old notebooks, but soon enough the flat was empty of \nthem. I think he did other redecorating, but I never got a good look, as the only \ntime he had his curtains open was when he was staring intently at my flat, \nwhich he now did every night. I tried to find evidence of the old Graham, but \nanything I could find online with a picture – it was always a picture of this new \nperson. I even asked some of my old classmates, but none of them seemed to \nremember him at all. \nEventually I moved. I really liked my old place in Clapham, but yeah, it just got \ntoo much. The last straw was when I was leaving for work one morning, and \ndidn’t realise until too late that Not Graham had left his building at the same \ntime. He greeted me by name, and his voice was nothing like it should have \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG003 – Across The Street \n12 \n \nbeen. I started to make my excuses and hurry away, but he just stared at me, \nand smiled. \n“Isn’t it funny, Amy, how you can live so near and never notice. I’ll need to \nreturn the visit someday.” \nI moved out a week later, and I never saw him again. \nJONATHAN SIMS \nStatement ends. \nI’d be tempted to dismiss this as hallucination resulting from long-term head \ntrauma complications, but Tim came through with this one and managed to \nget hold of Ms. Patel’s medical records. God knows how he got them, but he’d \nbetter not be using Institute funds to woo filing clerks again. The records just \ndon’t support the idea she was suffering those sort of problems. Not to \nmention I usually trust co-worker testimony as far as I can burn it, but her job \nreally doesn’t seem like the sort you could do with a compromised sense of \nreality. Ms. Patel has refused our request for a follow-up interview and seems \nto be trying to distance herself from these events. \n \nGraham Folger definitely existed, and appears to match up with her story. \nAccording to coroner’s records, Desmond and Samantha Folger, his parents, \ndied on the M1 near Sheffield on August 4th 2001, and Graham Folger’s name \nappears on the register of several colleges and universities in and around \nLondon over the next few years. The flat she mentioned did belong to \nMr Folger, but was sold through an agency in early 2007. All the photographs \nwe’ve been able to source seem to match the description of this “Not-Graham” \nthat Ms. Patel described, except for a few Polaroids, enclosed, which appear", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 7, "chunk_count": 9, "chars": 4309}}
