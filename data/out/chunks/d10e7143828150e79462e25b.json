What happened, Jared? I thought you only \nworked on the willing. \nJARED \nWhat? (small laugh) Says who? \nOhhh, the gym! Ha! I mean, yeah, they wanted to change, but they were still \nscared. First at what I'd do to ‘em, then at what would happen if the world \ncouldn't handle their beautiful new bodies. Not like I was doing it out of the \ngoodness of my heart. (snort laugh) Hearts. Anyway. Willing. Unwilling. Don't \nwork like that anymore, does it? You made sure of that. \nMARTIN \nThat's, not fair. \nJARED \nAnd what? \nMARTIN \nI, I-Mm, uh… \nJARED \n‘sides. Don't really matter now, does it? \nARCHIVIST \nNo. No, it doesn't. \n(Jared growls) \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 171 – The Gardener \n7 \n[Bones and muscle crack as he limbers up for a fight] \nMARTIN \n(Timid) Okay. \nJARED \nRight. So we doing this or what? I reckon I can get a few good hits in before I \ngo down. Leave you a little something to remember me by. \nARCHIVIST \n(Serious) No you won't. \n(Jared huffs a laugh) \nJARED \nNo, maybe not. But you gotta try, haven't you? \nMARTIN \nPlease don't. \nJARED \nWhat? \nMARTIN \nYou've already made your mark. \n(Jared considers, then chuckles) \nJARED \nFine. Consider it a favour. But I want something in return. Before he does it. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 171 – The Gardener \n8 \nMARTIN \nUm. \nARCHIVIST \nAlright. Let's hear it. \nJARED \nYou still do that talk-y thing? You know, drink up all the fear and spit it back \nout? \nARCHIVIST \nSort of, yes. \nJARED \nRight. Well, I'd like to hear about my garden. \n(Beat) \nARCHIVIST \nOkay. \nMARTIN \nLook, if this is some kind of trick— \nARCHIVIST \nIt isn't. \nJARED \nDon't fret yourself, little man. Just thought it might be nice, is all. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 171 – The Gardener \n9 \n[Hissing static starts] \n[Background garden sounds continue, with clear flesh and bone \nnoises throughout; there are no groans or screams] \nARCHIVIST \nCultivation notes for Fortisium Reece. Commonly known as the Gristlebloom \nOrchid. \nA popular feature in any mortal garden— \n[Hissing static ends] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \n—the striking petals that spring from the stems of the Gristlebloom are \ncertainly dramatic, stretched and straining as they are in a kaleidoscope of reds \nand pinks and browns around the pale cream of bony stalk. While proper \nconditions for development can be tricky to get precisely right, caution should \nbe exercised as — should an ideal environment be created — this plant can \ngrow and grow and grow. \nThe soil should be prepared first, a rich and earthy cocktail of insecurity and \nself-hatred that allows the roots to twist and contort freely. The temperature \nshould be kept the steady, humid warmth of air conditioners struggling to cope \nwith the perspiration of a dozen bodies pushing themselves too hard, while the \nlights must be kept at a harsh, fluorescent glare. Counterintuitively, growth is \nmost effective when the orchid is suffering from aggressive dehydration, and it \nis vitally important that the air roots be rarely praised, and only for the flowers' \nappearance and growth.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 1, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 3106}}
