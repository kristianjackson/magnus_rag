We dropped her off in Sydenham and I \nnever saw her again. \nIn the end it was actually Toni that asked we not work with Sarah Baldwin \nagain. Apparently she’d gotten “weird vibes” and didn’t feel comfortable \naround her. I agreed, though I didn’t share my reasons. The episode came out \nokay, in the end though, um, though I didn’t include anything about what I saw \nthat night. \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nInteresting. You say you recorded video of the event? \n \nMELANIE \nYeah, I’ve given your guys a copy, but watching it back the recording is so \ndistorted that you can’t really make anything out. \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG028 – Skin Tight \n13 \n \nHmm. And you’re sure you weren’t… dreaming? \n \nMELANIE \nAre you serious? \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nI just have to check every possibility. Obviously working in your field, you must \nhave quite a powerful imagination. \n \nMELANIE \nGreat! Great! I should have known this was a complete waste of my time. \nJONATHAN SIMS Probably. The only corroborating evidence you have is so \nbadly corrupted as to become almost unusable. But, we will do what \ninvestigation we can. \n \nMELANIE \n(Coarsely) Well, thank you so much. \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nWe’ll be in touch if we need anything else. Statement ends. \n \n[CLICK] \n \nAs I mentioned to Ms. King, there is little in this statement by way of \ninformation we can follow up. Cambridge Military Hospital is currently in the \nprocess of being turned into a housing development, so there is not much to \nbe done in that regard. There are records of a ‘grey lady’ ghost appearing in \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG028 – Skin Tight \n14 \n \nthe past, specifically in the form of a nurse, though none of them come even \nclose to matching this statement in terms of manifestation. \nWe were unable to track down Sarah Baldwin. The address Ms. King provided \nin Sydenham has not been occupied for the last six month, and does not list \nher as a previous tenant. We contacted Georgina Barker, who confirmed that \nshe had worked with Sarah Baldwin on two episodes of her “What the Ghost?” \npodcast, having previously met her at a networking event. She knew nothing \nabout her personal life and has not seen her since the last episode they \nworked on. Neither the phone number or email address received any answer \nor reply. Still, where do I know the name Sarah Baldwin from? If I have the \ntime I might go back over some earlier files, see what I can find. \nThe footage Ms. King provided was just as a corrupted as she said, being \nvirtually unwatchable. Just static and distortion. There’s only one or two \nframes where the quality is sufficient that anything can be made out. It \nappears to be an empty hospital room, as described. The only point where it \ndiffers from Ms. King’s story, is that there appear to be two figures in the shot, \nrather than just the one. The first seems to be kneeling, and matches the \ndescription of Sarah Baldwin. The other figure is much taller, and appears to be \npointing, though no features can be made out, it does not appear to be \ntouching the ground. \nRecording Ends. \n[The Magnus Archives Theme - Outro] \n \nThe Magnus Archives is a podcast distributed by Rusty Quill and licensed under \na creative commons attribution, non-commercial share alike 4.0 international \nlicense.
