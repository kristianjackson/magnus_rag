I don’t… I don’t speak French. I-I don’t \nread… I’ve never… \n(Sigh) I wish I could find it in myself to be surprised. \n[More pages turning] \nEr, statement, it seems, given directly to Gertrude. Though not apparently \nrecorded. Did she perhaps leave her tape recorder at home when she took this \nlittle ‘field trip’ with Gerard? June 2014. Barely a year before her murder, and \nless than half that before Gerard Keay’s brain tumour would lead to his own \ndeath. Did he know already? That his life was ending? Was he trying to \naccomplish one last good deed before the end? Were they both? “Étranger ou \nla saleté?” Foreigner or dirt. Stranger or Filth. I can see why with limited \n\ninformation Mr. Deschamps’ account could lend itself to either interpretation: \nsudden appearance of a vague and previously unknown figure inserting itself \ninto someone’s life on the one hand, and on the other... bugs and bad smells. \nLet it never be said the Hive and its ilk are subtle. Still, closer examination \npoints pretty conclusively in that direction. It must have been a \ndisappointment, especially if, as I suspect, Gertrude and Gerard were searching \nfor information on the Unknowing. \nBasira did some cursory follow-up on the statement itself. Benoît Maçon \ndefinitely died in late June 2014, but the Toulouse police records regarding the \nmatter are firmly sealed. François Deschamps has refused our request for a \nfollow-up interview. He did forward us one item, however. (Snorts) I can’t read \nthe French on this one, but it appears to be a crudely printed wedding \ninvitation. Benoît Maçon is the only name legible on it, as most of the details \nare obscured by a wide variety of dried stains. \nMost helpful of all, though, is the simple fact that Gertrude was in Toulouse in \nJune 2014. The information I found from her laptop doesn’t give a complete \npicture of her travels, but now I know when to look, and it appears that when \nshe left Toulouse she did not return to London. \nInstead, it looks like she took several connecting flights, eventually ending up \nin Wellington International Airport in New Zealand. I can’t find any other \ndetails on the computer, but I’m going to ask the others to see if they can hunt \ndown any statements referencing New Zealand in or around mid-2014. It might \nbe a wild goose chase, but it’s the best lead I have. \n\nIn the meantime I... I have a new flat. I should try to get comfortable, change \nthe locks. Even if I might need to be leaving it for a while. Oh, and… I suppose \nI… I did tell Georgie I’d try to talk to Martin. \n(The Archivist sighs.) \n[Tape clicks off. Tape clicks on.] \nARCHIVIST \nYou’re, er, sure you don’t mind? \nMARTIN \nNo, no, no, it’s fine, I’ve… I’ve kind of stop noticing if I’m honest. They just sort \nof… turn themselves on these days. (Pause. He becomes agitated and upset) \nLook I’m, I’m so sorry, John, I— Elias didn’t even tell any of us that you’d been \nkidnapped. I didn’t know— No-one else was telling me— And there wasn’t \nany— \nARCHIVIST \n(Overlapping) Oh. Hey. Hey, hey, hey... It’s alright, it’s alright. Elias didn’t tell \nanyone, there was, there was no way you could have known. I-I mean, I wasn’t \nexactly here before. \nMARTIN \n(Terse) No, you weren’t. (Pause) But I’m sure that if you could have been, you \nwould have. (Pause) Are you alright? They didn’t hurt you? \nARCHIVIST \n\nNo. No, no, I’m… I’m okay. Just— I mean my skin’s in better condition than... \never. Is that a weird thing to say? \nMARTIN \nA bit? \nARCHIVIST \nIt was basically all she talked about. Orsinov. I-It was— How’s everyone been? \nMARTIN \nOh, well, we’ve, we’ve been fine. I mean... Well, not great. Tim’s still... not \ndoing well. Melanie seems okay, but I get the feeling she’s... I don’t know, \nplanning something? \nARCHIVIST \nI- I got that feeling too. \nMARTIN \nBasira’s the only one doing— well, she seems weirdly calm about the whole \nthing. Like it’s… like she’s on a vacation or something. \nARCHIVIST \nMaybe she just suits the academic life. What about Daisy? \nMARTIN \nDon’t see her much. Which is fine by me. \n(There’s a tense pause.)", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 6, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 4117}}
