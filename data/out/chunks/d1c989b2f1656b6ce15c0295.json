The Magnus Archives. Episode one hundred and \nseventy-seven: \"Wonderland.\" \n[Theme finishes] \n[Tape clicks on] \n[Footsteps echo in a linoleum corridor; a tannoy mumbles words \nindistinctly; tinny upbeat muzak plays on constant repeat; in the \nmiddle distance comes the sporadic sound of trolleys rolling, \nreception phones and elevator bells ringing, and swing-doors in \nuse] \nMARTIN \nLook, this is ridiculous Basira. Can we please just talk? \nBASIRA \nNo. \nMARTIN \nWhy not? \nARCHIVIST \nMartin... \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 177 – Wonderland \n3 \nMARTIN \n(Exasperated) No, John. Enough is enough. It has been hours and not a bloody \nword! We have been slogging our way through literal nightmares to find you, \nBasira. There’s been p-plagues and wars and monsters and I– we’ve been \nworried sick. It has been awful and the least that— \nBASIRA \nCan’t have been that bad. \nMARTIN \nI– what? \nBASIRA \nYou look fine to me. \nMARTIN \n(Indignant) Excuse me? \nBASIRA \nWhole and healthy with a shoulder to lean on every step of the way. \nMARTIN \nBasira... \nARCHIVIST \n(Softly) Martin leave it. \nTrust me. She’s been through a lot more than we have. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 177 – Wonderland \n4 \nMARTIN \nI-It’s not a competition! Christ! I just wanted to talk. That’s all. \nBASIRA \nSo talk. \nMARTIN \nI mean stop and talk. \n[They stop walking] \nBASIRA \nI’d love that Martin. I really would. Unfortunately, you two cost me my only \nlead on Daisy. And I need to find her before she moves on. So unless you have \nsomething useful to say… \nARCHIVIST \nDaisy’s not here. She’s already moved on. \nBASIRA \nWhat? \nMARTIN \nSee, this is exactly the kind of thing that comes up when we talk— \nBASIRA \nMartin! \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 177 – Wonderland \n5 \nARCHIVIST \nI told you, I know everything now, more or less. I can see her. With my, uh... \nBASIRA \n…Magic horror-vision? \nARCHIVIST \nSure. \nMARTIN \nIt’s actually been amazingly useful so far. \nBASIRA \nSo you can control it now? \nARCHIVIST \nYes. \nBASIRA \nHmm. \n(Beat) \nMARTIN \nSo... \nWe know she’s not here, and John can find her wherever she goes... it sounds \nto me like we actually do have a moment to talk. Hm? \n(Beat) \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 177 – Wonderland \n6 \nYou might not care but it is good to see you Basira. It has been a long time \nsince we saw a friendly face. \nBASIRA \nFriendly wasn't what I was going for. \nMARTIN \nAll I’m saying is, it’s nice to find someone we can trust again. Ever since \neverything went to hell, it’s just been— \nBASIRA \nYeah, about that. \n(Turning to the Archivist) You caused this didn’t you? \n(The Archivist gives a heavy breath) \nDon't give me that look, you know what I mean. Did you mess up the world? \nYes or no. \n(Beat) \nARCHIVIST \nYes. \nBASIRA \nGoddamn it! I knew it was you! I knew it! \nMARTIN \nBasira... \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 177 – Wonderland \n7 \nARCHIVIST \nI didn’t mean to. Elias was... \nWe were all playing out this big ritual for him. With me as the lynchpin, the \ngate. \nBASIRA \nOh you didn’t mean to! Oh that’s all right then. Christ! I should’ve known... I… I \nshould’ve just let Daisy take you out at the start. \nMARTIN \nYou don’t mean that. \nBASIRA \nNo? \n(Exhales) I don’t know. Maybe. If I had... it would have stopped all this, \nwouldn’t it? \nARCHIVIST \nPerhaps. \nPerhaps not. \nBASIRA \n(Sarcastically) I thought you knew everything? \nMARTIN \nHe can’t do hypotheticals.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 0, "chunk_count": 10, "chars": 4207}}
