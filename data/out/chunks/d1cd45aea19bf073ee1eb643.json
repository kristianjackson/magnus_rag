Should I speak of its costume, the rich \nOttoman colours lined with fine fur? Or the dreadful stillness of its dark, \nshining face? The unmoving, painted eyes that met mine and could not see me \nrecoil? The torso simply ended as it disappeared below the table, and when I \nheld my nerve enough to climb into the tiny chamber below it, some small part \nof my soul cried out that I was devoured within the belly of the cruel device. \n \nDespite this, our exhibition to the Empress was a triumph, and I retreated from \nit both elated and utterly unsuspected. Indeed, such was the breadth of my \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG116 – The Show Must Go On \n \n7 \n \nsuccess, it carried me through another year travelling with Wolfgang and \noperating the Turk. I will not pretend that there was no joy to be had in my \nposition, both displaying the marvellous engineering and using my own \nprowess at the game of chess to fool great crowds of onlookers. Yet even then \nnothing could fully quiet that odd anxiety I felt when I looked upon the Turk, \nnor the strange and intricate dreams I had of it. \n \nBut eventually my business in London required my return, and Wolfgang had \nother projects to which he wished to devote his attentions, most notably a \ngrotesque “speaking machine” that he insisted would someday be capable of \nmastering human speech. I saw many of his designs: the bellows that aped the \nwork of lungs, the wooden box of valves and pipes, and that most grotesque \n‘mouth’ he had constructed of some awful undulating substance he claimed \nwas derived from an Indian tree. To dissuade him from his conviction that it \nwould someday be capable of rendering intelligible speech was impossible, but \nhearing the mournful wail that came from the spasmodic thing he called a \nmouth, I fervently prayed I would never have to be there when it did so. A \nprayer that went unanswered. \n \nWolfgang von Kempelen and his automata were far from my mind when I \nreceived the invitation from him, some fifteen or sixteen years having passed \nsince we had any cause to foregather. I was once again in Austria, through \ncoincidence, and received his letter in the dying days of summer, imploring me \nto attend a “grand performance” at the newly completed Court Theatre of \nBuda, many miles east in Budapest. It was not an insignificant journey from \nVienna, but Wolfgang’s letter pleaded that I be there. I was, so it would have \nme believe, indispensable in my attendance as “the oldest friend of the Turk”. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG116 – The Show Must Go On \n \n8 \n \nThis line, I will confess, filled me with an apprehension that bordered almost \non bone-deep fear, though at the time I had no cause to heed such a feeling. \nMy reason told me there was nothing to this but an oddly insistent invitation \nfrom an old friend, and I resolved to attend, if only to conquer the \nunaccountable terror that had taken residence within my heart. A terror I now \nknow I should have heeded in every respect. \n \nI shall waste no time detailing my journey to Budapest, nor my numerous \nfailures to locate Wolfgang once I arrived. I did make some small enquiries \nabout the Court Theatre, and learned something of its history, namely that it \nhad formerly been a Carmelite monastery, until Joseph II had had it dissolved \nthree years prior and commissioned Kempelen to convert it into the city’s first \ntheatre. The cells had now been taken for the actors’ dressing and the crypt \nremade into a trap room beneath the stage, which had itself been placed \nwhere the high altar of the chapel once stood. Perhaps this should have stirred \nsome further apprehension within me, but the changing fortunes of eastern \nchurches seemed so far away from Wolfgang and his strange machines that I \npaid it hardly any mind. \n \nThe date came at last, and it was with no small trepidation that I made my way \nto the Court Theatre of Buda. No tickets had been issued to me, nor had I seen \nany way in which they might have been acquired, but upon my approach, I \nnoted several other figures, finely garbed, making their way towards the \ntheatre with expressions that mirrored my own. The doors of the theatre were \nopen and standing either side of each entrance were things that on first \nappraisal appeared to be men. As I approached however, I recognised the stiff \nmotions and lifeless faces I had marked so sharply on the Turk. Dre", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 2, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 4500}}
