The shaking has gotten better over the \nlast few months, but it’s… still quite hard to read. Also my therapist has \nrecently changed up my medication, so if I get a bit muddled, that’s why. Just \nto be clear, my medication and treatment have been in response to the events \nI’m describing here. I was not taking any drugs before or during the event I’m \nsetting down. I only started my treatment course after Neil’s death. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG045 – Blood Bag \n2 \n \nI’ve been working as a research assistant for about six years now. Anyone who \ntries to sell you the career with promises of money, fulfilment or grand \ndiscoveries is a liar. The work is long and repetitive, the discoveries will be \ncredited to the fellows, at least until they’re disproved or irrelevant five years \ndown the line, and the money is… uh, well… the money is actually not too bad, \nat least not until the grant dries up halfway through the project. \nI guess what I mean to say is that, when I finally managed to get on a project \ndoing something I really believed in, I was prepared to overlook a lot. It was \nmalaria research at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. I was \nworking under Dr. Neil Thompson. I’m pretty sure he hired me just because of \nhow similar our names are: Thomas Neill and Neil Thompson. There was \nalways a little moment of confusion whenever anyone asked for ‘Neil’. I think \nhe got a kick out of it. That’s the sort of person he was, not mean-spirited or \nnasty, he just liked a bit of harmless chaos now and again. Balanced out his \nprecision in the lab, I suppose, because in there he was the sort of rigorous, \nmeticulous scientist I didn’t think existed outside of fictional medical dramas. \nPut it like this, he wore a white lab coat, and it was always immaculate. I don’t \nknow if you realise how genuinely impressive that is working in a lab, especially \ngiven as our work was messy. Very messy. \nWe weren’t working on malaria directly, you understand. Our work was on the \nanopheline mosquitoes themselves, transmission capable but… not infected, \nthough you’d hardly know by the reaction if one got loose. We’re talking \npanicked fleeing, lockdown, and trained staff coming in to kill the thing. I \nalways used to think that level of caution was ridiculous, given our mozzies \ndidn’t actually have malaria. Not so much anymore. \nWe were trying to synthesise a sort of ‘blood substitute’, a combination of the \nsugars and proteins that the mozzies need to survive, but one that was more \nenticing than a human full of blood. The idea was to create a, a lure of sorts, \nwhich would keep the mosquitoes concentrated away from people, and could \npotentially be used to poison them, though that bit was some ways in the \nfuture. At this point most of the research was spent trying to perfect the ‘taste’ \nof the thing, for lack of a better term.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 0, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 3640}}
