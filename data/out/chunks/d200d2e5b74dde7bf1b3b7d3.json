Then he turned and walked away. I \nlooked down, and saw a thick brown lump of mud. Nobody looked over, and I \ndidn’t follow him. \nI actually tried to take his advice. I had other things to be worried about, and \nfundamentally there was no reason for me to be so obsessed with a hole in the \nground. It wasn’t even like I needed to travel that road. I was only regularly \ntravelling to Olympia to apply for jobs, and from Tommy’s house the pit was in \nentirely the other direction. But I started to dream about it. \n\nDream about walking into the pit, the ground turning to thick, sucking mud \nunderneath me. I’d dream about it filling my mouth, my lungs. I couldn’t \nbreathe. \nThere was one, I can’t honestly say if it was a dream, but I also can’t bring \nmyself to call it a memory. It was sunny, the middle of the day. I could hear the \nsound of laughter from somewhere in town, soft voices chatting to each other. \nA peaceful day. I walked as far as the pit, and for the first time, I crossed the \nedge and began to climb down into it. It was dry, dusty, and the air felt \ndifferent from the rest of the town. Slowly, carefully, I walked to the hole in \nthe centre. This bit looked more like a sinkhole, disappearing down into the \npitch darkness. It was less than a foot across, and I felt a gentle rush of cool, \nwet air. I sat there in silence, listening, convinced I could hear something, but \nthere was only silence. I leaned closer, my head directly over the hole, and I \nheard it. And then I did what it told me to. \nI took my hand, and I reached down into the darkness. Down and down, until \nmy whole arm was inside, up to the shoulder. It was damp and cold, with the \nrough stone sides scraping my skin, but my hand was stretched as far as I \ncould, and it still gripped nothing but empty air. Then the hole began to close, \nand all at once the spell was broken. I tried to pull my arm out, to get free, but \nit held me tight. Not quite crushing me, but holding me in place. I screamed \nand cried for help, looking around for anyone who might be able to hear me, \nbut the only people walking by seemed utterly oblivious to what was \nhappening. Then I felt it, something brushing against my hand from below it in \nthe hole. Teeth. Wet, blunt teeth, which quickly gave way to a rough, slender \ntongue that wrapped itself around my hand and snaked up my arm, as though \ntasting me. \nThen, without warning I felt it snap back into the darkness, taking some of the \nskin with it, and my arm was abruptly released. \nThe next thing I remember I was lying in bed. I want to say I had just woken up \nand it was all a dream, but I was fully dressed, dusty, and with long, thin \nscratches that snaked around my arm. \nThat was when I started desperately looking for a way to leave Bucoda. I’d \nbeen there for just over a month by this point, and had managed to find a part-", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 4, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 3058}}
