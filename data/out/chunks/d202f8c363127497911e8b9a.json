I don’t know \nexactly how tall she had been before but now she loomed over me by almost a \nfull foot. \nHer eyes locked on mine and I began to feel something. It was like a hundred \ntiny, scurrying legs inside my skull, moving and scampering through my mind. I \nfelt my hands, which had dropped to the side of my body, begin to raise. They \ngripped my legs and then, apparently of their own accord, they began to crawl \nup me, climbing slowly over my stomach, my chest, my shoulders, until, finally, \nthey came to rest upon my throat. I’ve never been a strong man but that didn’t \nseem to matter as my own fingers began to close around my neck like a vice. \n\nPanic was making me breathe fast and shallow, but within seconds I couldn’t \neven do that. I don’t know if you’ve ever been strangled, but it takes a lot \nlonger than you think it does. I’ve no idea exactly how long it was before the \nedges of my vision began to go dark, but it felt like forever. \nThen, out of the corner of my eye I saw Mark, the researcher, move. I don’t \nknow how he’d broken whatever spell Annabelle had put him under but he’d \napparently managed to. With a sudden, unexpected motion, he charged at her \nand slammed his full weight into her side. The attack took her completely off \nguard and she fell hard against the edge of the broken window, the side of her \nhead making a god-awful crunching sound as it hit. \nAll at once the others collapsed onto the floor, like their strings had been cut. \nMy hands dropped as well, and I took a long, painful gasp of air. I collapsed, \ntaking a few moments to try and regain myself. Mark already had his phone \nout and was trying to call the police. I was groggy and my brain felt like \nsomeone had taken a belt-sander to it, but I managed to struggle to my feet. I \nlooked at the crumpled form of Annabelle Cane just as it started to get back \nup. I could see the side of her skull had been caved in, and beneath the wet \nmess of blood and bone, I saw a mass of dull white cobweb. \nI ran. I’m not proud of it. I ran out of that building, back to my car and I just \ndrove away. I drove for almost an hour before I finally pulled into a side road \nand started crying. I never saw any of them again. \nThe University administration contacted me before the police did. They told \nme in no uncertain terms that if I valued my job, I had officially not been in the \nbuilding that night. I didn’t really know what I’d have told tell the cops anyway, \nand I needed that job, so when I was questioned I told them I’d been home sick \n\nwith a stomach bug. I think the fact that I looked like death helped convince \nthem, and I wore a high-necked shirt to the interview. \nOfficial line was that Annabelle had suffered a psychotic break and broken the \nwindow, injuring a lot of people with broken glass before beating Mark half to \ndeath and fleeing the building. \nThe others in that room don’t seem to remember anything, and I don’t know if \nMark ever mentioned me in his testimony. He and Liz still haven’t returned to \nthe University, and I’ve not made any efforts to contact them. \nAs far as I know, Annabelle Cane is still out there. I’m keeping my distance from \nanything even remotely spider-related, though. I somehow managed to live \nthrough one horror movie. I have no intention of going looking for another. \nARCHIVIST \nStatement ends. \nMore spiders. \nMr Harlow’s testimony does at least have the decency to be widely \ncorroborated. The story of the psychology student who went mad during an \nESP study is still widely discussed in certain quarters of Surrey University, and \nthere are multiple newspaper articles covering the events in depth, though \nnone of them mention the, uh, arachnid angle, or indeed Mr Harlow’s \ninvolvement. Both Mark Voight and Dr Elizabeth Bates left the University \nalmost immediately following the incident under something of a cloud. \nDr Bates has refused our request for an interview point-blank, while Martin \ninforms me that Mr Voight’s testimony was disjointed and borderline \nincomprehensible.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 4, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 4094}}
