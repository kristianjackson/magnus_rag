You may \nsatisfy yourself I am content with the position you have found for me, and spare \nno concern for my well-being or the receipt of your charity. \nYour humble servant, \nHezekiah Wakely \nFebruary, 1838 \nNathaniel, something has happened to me. And I felt it only right to send a letter \nand let you know of it, being as your last letter expressed such a kind curiosity \ntowards my sleeplessness, and – what I mentioned to you in my earlier letters. \nMy nights have indeed been easier of late, something I may partially ascribe to \nthe recent outbreak of fever in the town – taking more of my time for the grim \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 152 – A Gravedigger’s Envy \n4 \n \nbusiness of grave digging – and the rest to my gradual settling into my position as \nsexton. \nThere is such peace in the churchyard, you see: to walk atop the soil knowing \nthat, deep below my feet, those blessed souls wait happy and silent in the cool, \ndamp earth, counting the days until the Resurrection. It gives me such warmth to \nthink of that I have taken to spending much of my unoccupied time wandering the \ngraves, and, where the mood allows me, taking my sleep there. \nI hope such talk does not upset you, and you may rest assured I am no suicide. It \nis simply the serenity of the dead I envy, not their lifelessness. I seek no escape \nfrom the hardships of life, for since you gave me this position I can call little of my \nlife any true hardship, and I am as free of suffering as I have ever been. \nBut I do long for that rest. I tell myself I wake each day renewed, but I am never as \ntruly satisfied as when I’m in my slumber, and insensible to the world. Perhaps \nthat’s what I hoped to find in my drinking, that gentle oblivion, but it seems like a \nworld ago. I know what it truly is now, walking the churchyard – though you may \nrest assured I shall wait my turn like a dutiful servant until our Lord sees fit to call \nme. \nI do find, however, that when I dig my graves, I have been going deeper. And at \ntimes, I worry I might dig so far as I can no longer get out with my meager ladder. \nNow, those moments – you must not cast judgment on me for this, Nathaniel, for \nit is simply a passing fancy – but I will often lie myself down on that soft earth, \nand I will sleep. And I swear to you that the sleep I find there is more blissful than \nany I have ever found. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 152 – A Gravedigger’s Envy \n5 \n \nIt was there, not a week ago, that it happened. I was digging a grave for the \nsquire’s father – a cruel and venal man, who I rather doubt has easy found himself \nin the kingdom of Heaven, but a pure soul is not what buys you a well-appointed \ncemetery plot, and he had plenty of money to do exactly that. I saw his body, you \nknow, as it was being prepared, and I tell you truly that for all the wickedness that \nman had done, his body knew gentle repose. Though not as gentle, perhaps, as it \nmight be with six feet of earth atop it. \nSo that was my task, and sure enough, I went about it with my usual fervent duty, \nsuch that the work of the day was done by the time the sun were at its height. It \nwas cold that day, and bitter windy, and cracking the ground had been as hard as \nice. At least until a few feet down. But by the end of it… oh, I tell you there was \nwarmth in that grave. Whether by my own body or the heat of the soil, I couldn’t \nsay, but it was as comfortable as the fireplace of a public house, and the wind \ncould not reach me in the hole that I had made. \nSo, as is my late habit, I lay down. And I had no sooner done this than a powerful \nsleep overtook me. \nI had a dream, then. I dreamt a rain had come. A terrible bitter rain that chilled \nmy bones and turned the soil around me dark and sodden. The walls grew damp \nand slippery, their firm shape lost as they began to slip and crumble. And then all \nat once they collapsed, the grave filling in a moment with a wave of mud and wet \ndirt. In a single terrible moment of utter terror, it was atop and around me, \ncovering my face and filling my lungs with its awful choking sod.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 1, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 4159}}
