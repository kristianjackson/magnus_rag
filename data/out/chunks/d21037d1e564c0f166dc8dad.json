This brightly-dressed man said there \nwas no reason to be alarmed, that he would ask his people to be on the \nlookout, and that Ivan would no doubt return when the show was about to \nstart. There was much to explore in the circus, he told my father patiently, and \nchildren often let their excitement get the better of them in this strange new \nplace, but they had never lost one yet. This last part he said with a smile that I \nthink was supposed to be reassuring, but reminded me too much of the tiger \nwith its shiny, unmoving teeth. \nI left them arguing there and went off to find Ivan. In my ten-year-old’s mind I \nwas sure that I would be able to figure out where my younger brother had \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG044 – Tightrope \n6 \n \nwandered to. I would return triumphant, and my father would tell all the \nvillage of how well I had done. As I walked, I became fascinated by the \nflickering gaslights, some clear and bright, others behind coloured glass, and \ndecided that Ivan would also have been drawn to them. So I followed them \nround the tent, and through the wagons and trucks, until I found myself \nstanding before a smaller tent, set off to the side of the big top. There was \nanother wooden sign across the top. This one appeared to be written in \nEnglish; I did not then understand what it said. Knowing what I know now, I \nbelieve it said, “Freak Show”. \nNow you must understand that the freak show was not part of a Soviet circus. \nIndeed, I believe even in America the practice has been out of fashion for \nmany, many years, so I did not have any idea what to expect when I went in \nlooking for Ivan. What I saw inside is one of the main reasons that I am so sure \nthat my experience deserves to be in your library. It’s the reason I went to \nMoscow to study medicine, for the people, if such they can be called, that I \nsaw in there were of such grotesque proportion and bodily forms that I \nbecame obsessed with learning how it was they might still live. \nIt was only when I was many years into my medical training that I finally \naccepted that, scientifically, such things were not possible. A mouth cannot \nfunction if it’s located anywhere other than the face. Limbs cannot bend like \nrubber. A man cannot walk and talk and stare without a head. You will, I hope, \nforgive my lack of precise descriptions. It has been 27 years since that night, \nand I can no longer clearly distinguish between what is memory and what is \nnightmare. \nI walked along the row of cages. Those few other patrons who had found their \nway to this tent turned around quickly, leaving with pale faces and shaking \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG044 – Tightrope \n7 \n \nlegs, but I was determined to find Ivan. I closed my eyes as I walked, opening \nthem only momentarily every few steps to check if he was there. I called out, \nbut there was no reply, either from my brother, or from the silent things in \ntheir cages. Finally, I reached the end of the tent. The last cage was empty, \nsave for a large hessian sack. It was tied by thick rope, wrapped around so \ntightly that it bulged through the gaps in its binding. I took momentary comfort \nin the fact that it was far too big to be Ivan. Still, I found myself approaching it, \ncuriosity momentarily overcoming my growing sense of dread. Then, in the \ndistance, the steam organ began to play, announcing the start of the show, and \nthe bag began to move. \nIt contorted itself, pulsing and throbbing like a wounded animal’s stomach, and \nfell heavily forward. I screamed and fled out into the frozen night. It was only \nwhen I was about to pass back out through the wooden gates that I stopped, \nremembering that, even if Ivan had fled like me, my father was still in this \nterrible place. I resolved to rescue him, and turned back towards the main \ntent. Light spilled out of the open entrance, as the steam organ kept playing. \nI entered to see two clowns fighting. Not the slapstick routines of the clowns \nI’d been used to, rife with wordplay and satire, but a crunching violence I had \nnever seen before. One of them, huge and scowling in white and purple polka-\ndots, pinned down its smaller companion, whose bright yellow shirt was now \nstreaked with red. With each blow from the big clown, the crowd, among \nwhom I could clearly see my father, howled with laughter and cheers. The \nlaughter didn’t sound right. None of it was right. It was as though I was looking \nat a tent full of vicious strangers, every one of whom wore a face I had", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 3, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 4500}}
