Either of you. \n[A distant thunderous boom from “Junior”] \nMARTIN \nLike hell it isn't. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 174 – The Great Beast \n19 \nARCHIVIST \nMartin. \nMARTIN \nDon't ‘Martin’ me! Sure, he looks like a harmless old man, but if— \nARCHIVIST \nI know, Martin; I know all the things he's done. \nHELEN \nFantastic! So, rip him up! Pop him! Oh, oh, but, um, just give me a bit of a \nheads-start so I can find a good spot. \nMARTIN \nEnough, Helen. \nHELEN \nI won't be in the way! He won't even know I'm there. Again. \nMARTIN \nWhat is it, John? What's wrong? \nARCHIVIST \nI just— This whole... avenging angel thing, I, I'm not… \nIt doesn't feel right. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 174 – The Great Beast \n20 \nMARTIN \n(With a humourless laugh) It seemed to feel right when we were avenging all \nthe wrongs done against you. \nARCHIVIST \nI-I know. I, I, I know, alright? But well ah— \nThat's kind of the problem; I-I have all this power, and, and I, I want to use it to \ntry to help, but I — (under breath) I don't know — (normal) I mean, I do. \n(emotional) I-I've done so much damage, and- and anything that might help to \nbalance that is— (composed) But killing other avatars is, is not— I, I don't think \nit makes anything better. I think it just makes me worse. \nMARTIN \nYou're removing evil from the world. \nARCHIVIST \nI, I'm not though, am I? The tenement fire is still burning. The mortal garden is \ngrowing wild. The carousel— \nHELEN \nAah! \nARCHIVIST \n(Annoyed) What. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 174 – The Great Beast \n21 \nHELEN \nHow are we still having this intensely boring conversation? I honestly thought \nthat actually ending the world would be enough to stop you whining, but no! \nYou're the most powerful person in a world where the worst consequences \nimaginable have already happened! Absolute power, with zero responsibility! \nWhat more can you possibly need to just enjoy yourself a tiny bit? \n [A distant thunderous boom from “Junior”] \n(Beat) \nHELEN (CONT'D) \nFine! Guess I'll just leave then! Hang out inside myself until you get angry again \nand accidentally have some fun. \nARCHIVIST \nIt's not. Fun. \n(Helen laughs) \nHELEN \nAnd here I thought you'd forgotten how to make jokes. \n[Her door creaks as she leaves, then shuts] \n[The faint hissing static and high-pitched tone ends] \n(The Archivist sighs) \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 174 – The Great Beast \n22 \nARCHIVIST \nI, I-I, I'm sorry, Martin. After meeting the child, I thought, I'd been— (sudden \nburst) I really hoped things would be simpler, you know? A nice \nstraightforward apocalypse. \nMARTIN \n(Sighing) No, I'm sorry; cheerleading you when you're on a magical murder \nspree probably wasn't a great idea. \nARCHIVIST \nI started it. \n(Beat) \nMARTIN \nGood point! (small laugh) I'll keep my apology, then. \n[Fabric rustles] \n(Martin makes a happy hmm and exhales) \nMARTIN \nI do kinda wish you'd waited until after Fairchild to have your crisis, though. \nARCHIVIST \nYou really want that old man dead. \nMARTIN \nI mean, sure-yeah, sure, when you say it like that it sounds bad. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 174 – The Great Beast \n23 \nARCHIVIST \nWhat did he do to you? \nMARTIN \nHe threatened to throw me off a rollercoaster. \nARCHIVIST \n(Amused) Ah. \nMARTIN \nOkay, I, I know it sounds like a joke, but— \nARCHIVIST \n(Straight-faced) No, obviously, he's an avatar of the Vast, I understand, it's a \nscary threat coming from him. \nMARTIN \n(Surprised) Yeah! \nARCHIVIST \nIt just… doesn't, sound like a scary threat. \nMARTIN \nThanks for that. \nHang on, you're still down to kill Elias, right? Uh-uh Jonah. Whatever. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 174 – The Great Beast \n24 \nARCHIVIST \nI'm still going to confront him. I don't know if killing him is something I'm \neven… capable of, but if I can and I have to, I will. \nMARTIN \nYeah? \nARCHIVIST \nDon't worry. I won't hesitate. \nMARTIN \nRight. \n[A distant thunderous boom from “Junior”] \nMARTIN (CONT’D) \nRight, alright then. Good. \n[He takes a step] \nMARTIN (CONT’D) \nLet's go, then.
