Tasting fear, more wire slithers through the churned earth towards him, \nstretching and gripping him tight, rough needles puncturing his legs and chest \nand throat, pulling him down and holding him steady as the drone lingers, its \nblankness giving no hint of the thoughts behind its trigger. \nThere is a rumbling in the earth around him as a tank speeds along its \nunstoppable path, and Charlie is immediately pulled under its tread. He has a \nmoment of shocked horror, before being reduced to a smear in the mud. \nInside the tank, Ishaan screams. \nIshaan remembers the recruiters. He was promised valour, and camaraderie, \nand the chance to be part of something meaningful. He knew that part had \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 163 – In the Trenches \n14 \nbeen a lie, but then, so was the choice. His alternative was stagnant poverty, \nand that was really no choice at all. The money would help his family, and he \ncould spend some years in hell, if he needed to. For them. But he didn’t know \nabout this war, that had always been raging and would never stop. How could \nhe have known what the trench would be? \nThey had taken him, dragged him from the flooded foxhole where he had \nsheltered for a moment’s brief respite, and taken him to the tanks, those \nmonstrous beasts of iron that rolled forever forward, guns firing and treads \nleaving the earth scarred in their wake. They pass above the trench again and \nagain and they never turn around, pushing onward, ever onwards, the bones \nthat stick in their gears not slowing them for a moment. Ishaan had been \nafraid. Terrified that they were going to strap him to it, pin him to the Goliath’s \nhull like all the other flayed flags of war, striking fear into the hearts of the \nenemy. But instead they fed him to it, tossed him into its burning innards and \nsealed the hatch behind him. Now, his body has contorted itself to fit, his \nfingers clutched around the firing lever; pulling it frantically is the only thing \nthat will reduce the impossible heat even for a moment. From the tiny slit in \nthe metal, he can see other soldiers: baby-faced friends and the monstrous, \npig-faced enemy, both falling underneath his iron coffin’s advance. He tries to \ncry, but his tears turn to steam. \nHe waits, craving and dreading the final kiss of the bombs, the terrible \nthundering guns so far away that none have ever seen them, raining their \narbitrary ruin upon the endless fields of the dead and dying. They are perhaps \nthe only thing that can fell the tanks, splitting them like rotten fruit beneath \nthe force of their rounds. Ishaan begs, pleading with whatever god of hatred \nand pain he hears piping gently on the breeze to let the bombs rain down on", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 3, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 2707}}
