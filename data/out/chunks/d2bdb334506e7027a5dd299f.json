Then it split. And out came spiders. Dozens, \nhundreds of spiders erupting from this apple that was rotting right before my \neyes. I shrieked and dropped it before any of them could touch my arm. The \napple fell to the ground and burst in a cloud of dust. I backed away and waited \nuntil I was sure all the spiders had left before retrieving the box. I smashed it \nwith a crowbar and threw the remains into a skip. \nFather Burroughs returned shortly afterwards. He told me he’d done his \nprayers and hoped that it would be some help. If he noticed the felled tree, he \ndidn’t ask any questions about it, instead he just handed me his business card \nand told me to give him a call if there were any further problems. The house \ndidn’t feel any different, but there was no smell of burned hair, no heat or \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG008 – Burned Out \n12 \n \nghosts or any weirdness I could see. I worked on that house for another week, \nand I don’t know if it was the father’s prayers or my uprooting the tree but I \ndidn’t encounter anything else unusual during my time there. After that, my \npart of the job was finished, and I haven’t been back to Hill Top Road since. \nJONATHAN SIMS \nStatement ends. \nAh, head trauma and latent schizophrenia – the ghost’s best friends. Aside \nfrom excessive indulgence in psychoactive drugs, it seems to me that there is \nsimply no better way to make contact with the spirit world. Still, glibness aside, \nthe history of 105 Hill Top Road does bear investigation. And while I trust Mr \nLensik’s testimony of his own experiences about as far as I can throw a \nbleeding tree, there is a note in the file mentioning that Father Edwin \nBurroughs put down his own version of these events in Statement 0218011. \nWhile I have yet to locate that particular file in the chaos that passed for \nGertrude Robinson’s archive, the suggestion that there may be external \ncorroboration does lend some potential credence to Mr Lensik’s wild tale. No \nother workers on the building site at the time reported any disturbances like \nthe ones reported by Mr Lensik. \nMartin was unable to find the exact date the original house was built but the \nearliest records he could find list it as being bought by Walter Fielding in 1891. \nIt was inherited by his son Alfred Fielding in 1923 and then by his grandson, \nRaymond Fielding, in 1957. There was no record of it being used as a halfway \nhouse, certainly not one connected to the local Catholic diocese although the \nChurch of England records for the area that Sasha got access to were \nunfortunately incomplete.
