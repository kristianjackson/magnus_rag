And believe me \nwhen I say that’s… not somewhere you want to be. \nMARTIN \nYeah. I guess. \nGod, I hate all of these… loose ends. \nARCHIVIST \nI’m sorry. \nMARTIN \nIts-it’s fine. We’ll just have to tie them all up in one go. \nARCHIVIST \nHm? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 178 – The Processing Line \n6 \nMARTIN \nAround Elias’ neck. \nARCHIVIST \nAh. \nBASIRA \n(Impatiently) Which way? \nARCHIVIST \nLeft. Just up ahead. Although… uh, um, actually, you might want to head \nthrough that door and wait. \nBASIRA \nAgain? Already? \nARCHIVIST \nThere’s a lot of fear in this place. \n(Annoyed sigh from Basira) \nMARTIN \nWhat’s in there? \nARCHIVIST \nTool cupboard. Safe enough place to wait. \nBASIRA \nFine. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 178 – The Processing Line \n7 \n[Door opens and metallic jangling is heard] \nMARTIN \n(Emphatically) Nope. \nBASIRA \nWhat the hell sort of tools are those? \nARCHIVIST \nFlesh factory, remember? \nMARTIN \nNew plan. We wait in the corridor. You go in the spike cupboard and tell your \nstory to all the hooks and stuff. \nARCHIVIST \nFine. Just don’t wander off. \n[More metallic jangles as the Archivist enters and closes door] \nARCHIVIST \nHm. It could be worse. At least they’re clean. \n(Deep breath) \n[Hissing static starts] \n[The sounds of industrial processing become sharper, and the \nmultitude of synchronized footsteps clearer and are heard \nthroughout the entire statement] \n[Hissing static ends] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 178 – The Processing Line \n8 \nARCHIVIST \nTime has no meaning in this place, but that does nothing to lessen the \ncertainty that Tyler has been in this line for years. A steady stream of sweat \nflows down his neck, staining his rough-weaved jumpsuit, and sticking the itchy \nmaterial to the skin of his back. The heat of this place is intense, but more than \nthat, it is the apprehension, the waiting, the inching step by step towards his \nown consumption. He wants to turn and run, to push past the endless row of \ndesperate, weeping people and flee this place. But where would he go? There \nis nowhere else, only the processing plant, and he’s heard the stories of what \nhappens if you don’t get processed through the official channels. It’s messy \nand, more than that, they just throw the remains away. Nothing is used. And \ndeep-down Tyler knows that’s what he’s for. He’s there to be useful, and the \nthought of running from that scares him as much as whatever is waiting for \nhim at the end of the line. \nAnother person processed, another step forward on the snaking line of bodies. \nTyler tries for a moment to remember how he got here, where he was before \nthis room of noise and heat and patient, waiting figures. It’s faded now. He \nremembers aches and worries and, sometimes, something that might have \nbeen joy, but it’s far away now, like something seen projected on a distant \nwall. \nAnother step forward, and he’s standing at a desk. The person behind it – is \nthat a person? – wears a loose hood of coarse black leather. Below it they wear \na featureless mask of the same material without a gap for eyes or mouth or \neven the shape of a nose. They wordlessly slide a form across to Tyler. \n[Distorted grunts and sounds of paper sliding]", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 1, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 3201}}
