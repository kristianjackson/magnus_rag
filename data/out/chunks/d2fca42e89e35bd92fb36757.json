And if Peter had won, none of this would have happened. Also, not to \nmake excuses, but they weren't exactly lies. Just… oversimplifications of \ncomplicated truths. And guesses. \nA lot of guesses. \nAlmost all guesses, really, now I come to think about it. \nMARTIN \nShut up! I don't care. \nSIMON \nGoodness! We're rather tetchy, aren't we? \nARCHIVIST \nWe've... (slight laugh) not been having an easy journey. \nMARTIN \nJohn. \nARCHIVIST \nWhat, it's true; we haven't. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 174 – The Great Beast \n14 \nSIMON \nWell, in that case, thank you for swinging by to my, huge corner of the \napocalypse. We don't get many visitors these days, and, well, you might be the \nclosest thing the universe has ever had to an important person. \nARCHIVIST \nOh, I… um… \nSIMON \nI mean, obviously you're still ultimately finite and all that, but altering the very \nfabric of reality, that's... (‘phew’ whistle) That's pretty good going, all things \nconsidered. \n[Martin turns to the Archivist] \nMARTIN \nThat's enough. John? \nARCHIVIST \nUh... yes? \nMARTIN \nDo it. \n[A distant thunderous boom from “Junior”] \nARCHIVIST \nUhh… \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 174 – The Great Beast \n15 \nSIMON \nDo what? \nMARTIN \nKill him. \n(The Archivist splutters, exhales) \nSIMON \nHa-hang on. Can he do that? \nMARTIN \n(Firm) He can, and he's going to! \nSIMON \n(Crosstalk) Oh! Right! Um. Seems a bit rude, to be honest. Uh… \nARCHIVIST \n(Crosstalk) erm o-okay, just... \nMARTIN \nJohn? \nARCHIVIST \n(Crosstalk) J-Just give me a moment! I— \nSIMON \n(Crosstalk) I-In fact, yes! Y-you know what? I'll, I'll probably just be going, then- \nI, I- I'd prefer to keep existing, if it's all the same to you, uhm— \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 174 – The Great Beast \n16 \nMARTIN \nJ-John! \nARCHIVIST \nI… \nSIMON \n(fast) Been lovely chatting to you! Good to see you both. Feel free to pop by \nagain when you're feeling less, um… murdery. \n(Martin splutters while he speaks) \nMARTIN \n(yelling) John! \nSIMON \nByeee! \n[With a whoosh and the sound of debris scattering, Simon leaves] \n(The Archivist sighs) \nMARTIN \nYou let him go. \nARCHIVIST \n(Quiet) Yeah. \nMARTIN \nWhy? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 174 – The Great Beast \n17 \nARCHIVIST \nBecause, uh... uh— \nMARTIN \n(Interrupting) Why did you let him go, John? \nARCHIVIST \n(Sharp) I don't know, I just… (sigh) I didn't want to kill him. \nMARTIN \n(Calm, becoming sarcastic) Why not? Because he was nice to you? Because he \nwas charming, ‘cause he was fun? \nARCHIVIST \nNo, I, I, I just— (sighs) \n[A door creaks open] \n [Faint hissing static and a high-pitched tone start] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nNot now, Helen! \nHELEN \nI just wanted to add my vote to the disappointed side. \nMARTIN \nWait, really? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 174 – The Great Beast \n18 \nHELEN \nI was rather looking forward to watching an old man metaphysically explode. \nHonestly, I feel a little bit cheated. The others were exceptional fun. \n(The Archivist sighs as she speaks) \nARCHIVIST \nWait, y-you were watching? \nHELEN \n(Amused) Of course. As much fun as the new world is, I am not about to miss a \nreal, honest-to-godless demigod murder spree! \n(She laughs) \n(Martin sighs) \nMARTIN \nYou're really not helping. \nHELEN \n(Cheerful) I'm not trying to! \nARCHIVIST \nLook, it's none of your business. Either of you. \n[A distant thunderous boom from “Junior”] \nMARTIN \nLike hell it isn't. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 174 – The Great Beast \n19 \nARCHIVIST \nMartin. \nMARTIN \nDon't ‘Martin’ me! Sure, he looks like a harmless old man, but if— \nARCHIVIST \nI know, Martin; I know all the things he's done. \nHELEN \nFantastic! So, rip him up! Pop him! Oh, oh, but, um, just give me a bit of a \nheads-start so I can find a good spot. \nMARTIN \nEnough, Helen. \nHELEN \nI won't be in the way! He won't even know I'm there. Again. \nMARTIN \nWhat is it, John? What's wrong? \nARCHIVIST \nI just— This whole... avenging angel thing, I, I'm not… \nIt doesn't feel right.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 4, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 4140}}
