God knows what she was planning to do; I \ndon’t think even she was completely sure. Something about catching the \nprotesters sleeping and bothering them the way she thought they’d been \nbothering her. She’d found her way to the rooms they’d taken over, and was \nabout to go in, when she’d glanced through the small window on the swinging \ndouble doors. \nThey were lying on the floor, she told me. All of them. Not like they were \nsleeping, but like they’d just… collapsed, motionless, where they had been \nstanding. There were no placards, no signs, just a couple dozen normal-looking \nstudents fallen to the floor. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG094 – Dead Woman Walking \n6 \n \nTheir chests moved up and down slowly, so Alex was sure they’d been alive, \nbut… their eyes stared vacantly into the space in front of them, and everything \nelse about them seemed lifeless and empty. Some of them were lying with \ntheir heads or legs at odd, uncomfortable-looking angles, but they either didn’t \nnotice or didn’t care. They all seemed to have fallen away from a single, central \npoint in the room. Kneeling there was the only figure who hadn’t collapsed. \nShe was an older woman, Alex said, and was almost completely naked. Her \nskin was pale and her head was shaved. Like the others, she was still, with only \nthe movement of her chest showing she was still alive, but unlike those on the \nfloor, her eyes moved. They gently swept from one side of the room to the \nother, like she was searching for something. \nThen those eyes settled on Alex, staring in through the door. The eyes didn’t \nlight up, they didn’t narrow, or show any sign they’d registered her existence. \nThey just stopped moving and looked at Alex, as though waiting for her next \nmove. And it was at that point Alex had recognised the woman, and run. \nObviously, I wanted to know who the woman was, and I demanded Alex tell \nme, but she just told me to… Well, she said she didn’t want to say, and pushed \nher now-cold lunch away from her. I wasn’t letting her get away that easily, \nand I pressed the point. Who was this woman with the shaved head? Where \nhad she seen her before? \nFinally, Alex admitted she’d seen the woman during classes at the Medical \nBuilding. Was she a tutor? What was her name? Alex looked me right in the \neyes. “They weren’t allowed to tell us their names.” \nIt took a few moments to work out what she meant, and when I did I felt dizzy. \nAlex had such absolute certainty in her voice, but she had to be wrong. It was \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG094 – Dead Woman Walking \n7 \n \nimpossible. I had no idea what to say, and all I could manage to do was blurt \nout, “Tuna?” She stared at me for a few seconds, then shrugged, and looked to \nthe floor. \nWe sat there in silence for a long time, trying to understand what had just \nbeen said. I mean, there was no way that there could be something in a \nuniversity building causing students to collapse, and nobody was taking any \nsteps to deal with it. \nEspecially if it involved one of the cadavers, it just wasn’t possible. But the only \nother explanation I could come up with was that Alex was lying, and I just \nneeded to look at her to know that was even less likely. So I did what I felt was \nthe only thing I could do in that situation. I told her I’d go with her if she \nwanted to take a second look. She didn’t, but we went anyway. \nIt was Saturday, and the place was eerily quiet. Even without classes or labs, \nthere were always a few students hovering about, going to and from places, \neager to get some work done when everywhere wasn’t so crowded. But all we \npassed heading into the building was a single police car, sat empty, just slightly \nmounting the kerb. The door to the Medical Science building stood open; it \nwas a bright day, but the hall stood dark. Alex looked at me, just once, as if \nasking whether I was sure about doing this. I wasn’t, but… I still nodded. \nWe stepped inside. The building was cool and quiet, with just the faint drone \nof the air conditioning in the background. I’d never actually been inside before, \nbut Alex’s steps were confident in their direction, even if she wasn’t confident \nin her purpose. Finally, she pushed open a pair of doors to one of the teaching \nrooms, and… I saw the scene she had described.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 2, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 4371}}
