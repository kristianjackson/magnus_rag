And so they fall to frantic tearing \nconflict just as vicious as it was when it was bearing down on you. \n \nYou lie there in the fugue of vivid pain and feel that gentle rain from violence \noverhead as some fall dead (or close as this place lets you lie for truly thus to \ndie would be too eager an escape) and listen to the ebb and swell of slow, \nmelodic wail that well you know conducts the flowing rhythm laced into this \nendless faceless dance. \n \nAt last a victor breaks away in clinging heartfelt terror of his former comrades, \nsprinting bold and holding to his skull the severed face that was once yours. \nWilling it to stick as those who notice try to pick themselves back up and give \npursuit to close the gap. \n \nPerhaps you should arise and follow on the things that once you would \ndespise but now have joined. You are, of course, a faceless thing as well and so \nshould \nquickly march the pace of those who chase the self-same prey. But now it is \ntoo late they've gone. Their chase will not abate until their former friend is \nripped apart in turn. And you have learned to wait. \n \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 165 – Revolutions \n14 \nFor there are many faces out upon the carousel, and many names that you \nmight be. \nSo bide your time a while and wait the coming of another one whose fate and \nface \nmight sit upon your grinning carmine skull. \n \nSo turn with the turn of the merry-go-round and dance to its jolly old song. \nWho will you be, with a name or three, and a stranger's face worn wrong? \n[Hissing static starts] \n[The music, metal and screams fade into the distance; the \nwasteland wind returns] \n[Hissing static ends] \nARCHIVIST \nEnd recording. \n[Tape clicks off] \n[Tape clicks on] \n[The ‘Unknowing’ music, metal gears and groans, and screams of \npeople are much closer and clearer] \n[Footsteps, as Martin and the Archivist walk] \nMARTIN \nYou're joking! \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 165 – Revolutions \n15 \nARCHIVIST \n(Amused) I'm not. \nMARTIN \n…So was it any good? \nARCHIVIST \nUh, what do you mean? \nMARTIN \nWas it a good poem? \nARCHIVIST \nI don't know! No? You're the poetry expert, Martin, not me. \nMARTIN \nWell did it stir any feeling in you? \nARCHIVIST \nYes, nausea! Because of the horrible things in it. \nMARTIN \nThat's not quite what I meant. \nARCHIVIST \nThen I don't know what you mean, Martin; I'm not a poetry person, I don't… \nget it. I never have. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 165 – Revolutions \n16 \nMARTIN \nThat's-That's fine; I understand. \nARCHIVIST \nLook, I'm better than I was. I used to think all poetry was bad. \nMARTIN \nSorry, what? \nARCHIVIST \nI mean, I just thought of— I sort of thought it was pointless. Just—write some \nprose and stop wasting everyone's time. \nMARTIN \nHm. What changed? \nARCHIVIST \nI don't know, I just… mellowed on it, I suppose. \nMARTIN \nThat's, kind of weird. \nARCHIVIST \nIn my defence, there is a lot of bad poetry out there. \nMARTIN \nI guess? \n(Beat)", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 3, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 3940}}
