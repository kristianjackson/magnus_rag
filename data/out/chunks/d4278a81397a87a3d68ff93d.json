She was still standing upright, but from the open mouth, I could \nsee that her body was completely hollow, save for a few cobwebs that I could \njust make out under the streetlights. I ran the hell away. \nAnd that’s the last creature I encountered. That’s my whole story. You’re \nwelcome to it. When I thought it was just vampires about, I might have given \nyou people a miss as a bunch of kooks. But if there’s other stuff around out \nthere, well maybe you know about it than me. And maybe you could use a bit \nmore information on vampires. It’s a shame I’m on the way out. I will miss the \nhunt. \n\nThe Magnus Archives –056 – Children of the Night \n14 \n \nARCHIVIST \nStatement ends. \nWell, this is... certainly a surprise. Martin informed me that Mr Herbert passed \naway after making his initial statement, so it is rather a shock to find this \nmisfiled addition to his original, even if it is partially incomplete. What’s more, \nactually checking the hospital and death records for both London and \nManchester, I can’t find any record of Mr Herbert’s death. Then again, I can \nfind no record of him alive either after the date of the statement. The idea that \nhe could survive six years with untreated late stage lung cancer is implausible, \nto say the least, and yet... \nAlard Dupont’s death appears to match the statement in most of the \nparticulars. He had a half dozen convictions against him for various drug \ncharges or violent misdemeanours, but nothing exceptional. I can’t find any \nindication of muteness, but aside from that, everything checks out. As for the \nspider person, the only proof of its existence seems to be that I am far too \nunlucky for it to simply be an old tramp’s hallucination. I need to have some \nwords with Martin. \nEnd recording. \n[Tape clicks off. Tape clicks on.] \n\nThe Magnus Archives –056 – Children of the Night \n15 \n \nARCHIVIST \nSit down. \nMARTIN \nWhat is... \nARCHIVIST \nSit. \n[Martin sits] \nARCHIVIST \nWhy did you lie to me about Trevor? \nMARTIN \nWhat? \nARCHIVIST \nWhy did you tell me he was dead? \nMARTIN \nSorry, who’s, who’s Trevor? \n\nThe Magnus Archives –056 – Children of the Night \n16 \n \nARCHIVIST \nTrevor Herbert! The tramp, the ‘vampire hunter’. You told me he died! \nMARTIN \nBut I mean, he did. D-didn’t he? \nARCHIVIST \nApparently not. \nMARTIN \nOh. Sorry. \nARCHIVIST \nSorry? \nMARTIN \nI mean I, I didn’t ever actually meet him. I just heard some of the other \nresearchers mentioning it. \nARCHIVIST \nWhat? \n \n\nThe Magnus Archives –056 – Children of the Night \n17 \n \nMARTIN \nYeah, well, I could have sworn they had said he died. I mean, maybe they just \nsaid he looks like death or something, but I really thought they said he was \ndead. \nARCHIVIST \nSo that’s it? Just a misunderstanding? \nMARTIN \nYes. You seem to be taking this kind of personally. \nARCHIVIST \nBecause you keep lying to me, Martin! \nMARTIN \nAbout what? \nARCHIVIST \nI don’t know, but you are. \n[The sounds of rustling paper.] \n \n\nThe Magnus Archives –056 – Children of the Night \n18 \n \nMARTIN \nWhere did you get that? Have you been going through the bins? \nARCHIVIST \nIt was in the old document room, just next to where you used to sleep. Your \nhandwriting, “If the others find out I’ve been lying”. Lying about what, Martin? \nMARTIN \nLook, just forget about it, okay, please? \nARCHIVIST \nI can’t forget it! Everyone in this place has so many goddamn secrets and I \ncan’t trust a word you say! Not about this and not about Trevor! \nMARTIN \nJohn, just– \nARCHIVIST \n(Shouting) Martin! \nMARTIN \nOkay, okay, okay, just, just promise you won’t fire me. \n\nThe Magnus Archives –056 – Children of the Night \n19 \n \nARCHIVIST \nFire you? Fine. \nMARTIN \nI... I lied on my CV. \nARCHIVIST \nWhat? \nMARTIN \nI don’t have a masters in parapsychology. I don’t even have a degree. When I \nwas 17, my mum, she had… Look, she had some problems and I ended up \ndropping out of school, trying to support us. I tried everything, but nowhere \nwas hiring. So, I just kind of started to lie on my applications. Sending them out \nto just about anywhere. For some reason, my lie about my parapsychology got \nme an interview with Elias and then a, a job here. M-most of my employment \ndetails are made up. I’m only 29. \nARCHIVIST \nRight. I... uh... I believe you. \nMARTIN", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 6, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 4356}}
