Used to just be me, firing my music \nthoughts onto a blog, but a few years back my then-friend, now-boss Tommy \nMoncreef said he was starting up a music site, and would I write for it? I said of \ncourse I would, and now here I am running video content for it. Earful.com’s \nonly been around three years or so, but to be honest in the world of music \nsites, that gives us a pretty decent pedigree. Tommy’s from the old school – \nused to write for dozens of music magazines, back in the dead tree days, \nbefore print became an embarrassing older relative that just wouldn’t die. \nPoint is, he knew a lot of older contacts and writers, most of which he brought \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG042 – Grifter’s Bone \n3 \n \non board for Earful. That means I was quickly brought up to speed on decades \nworth of London music scene gossip by middle-aged white men who only ever \nwore T-shirts for bands that ended tragically. And that's when I started to hear \nabout Grifter's Bone. \nWhenever someone was listening to some sub-par submission, or even just \nsome music of their own that wasn't well regarded, one of the old timers, \nusually Mike Baker, would shout over, “I see you got the new Grifter's Bone \nalbum!” or “I didn't know Grifter's Bone reformed!” or something like that. It \nwas annoying as hell, but I never really brought it up. And after hearing every \npossible variation of the story from a half-dozen drunken writers at our \nChristmas do, I just kind of decided to let it go. \nI didn't think much more about it until earlier this year. There's a guy who \nworks for Earful by the name of Lee Kipple. His official title is ‘Submissions \nEditor’, though we call it something a little more vulgar, and it’s his job to listen \nthrough all the music we're sent unsolicited. CDs, mp3s; recently there's even \nbeen a weird fad for sending in music on novelty USB drives. He listens to all of \nit. As you can imagine, most of it’s awful. Still, Lee is pretty much the nicest guy \nI've ever met, and I don't think I've ever once heard him complain. He's tall, a \nbit lanky, with long blond hair that covers his ears. And his eyes if he's not \ncareful. \nBecause of his job, Lee obviously gets a lot of comments about listening to \ncrappy music, and if it's one of the older folk you can bet they'll mention \nGrifter's Bone. It took me a while to notice how weird his reaction was when \nthis happened. Whereas most of the staff would fake laugh, sigh or maybe \nswear a little, Lee would go very still. He'd nod gently, and reach up to scratch \nhis ears, still mostly covered by hair. No-one seemed to notice. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG042 – Grifter’s Bone \n4 \n \nI kept watching him, and the pattern repeated whenever the band was \nmentioned. I don't know when I decided that he must have seen Grifter's Bone \nperform live, but I did. And more than that, I decided he must have fake ears, \nhaving torn his own off when he saw the show, and that's why he wore his hair \nso long to cover them. I didn't really believe it, obviously. It was just a fun little \ntheory I liked to play around with. But the more I watched Lee, the more it \nseemed that he did deliberately try to keep his ears covered. \nFinally, about a month ago, I decided to just ask him. We'd all gone out for \ndrinks, and I'll admit I may have had a few more vodka tonics than would have \nbeen wise, but when the others had headed home and it was just Lee left, I \ndecided now was the time. I asked him if they were as bad as everyone said. \nHe looked puzzled, and I leaned in closer. “Grifter's Bone”, I said. He froze, \ncompletely still. I waited for him to touch his ears, but instead he just stared at \nme, unmoving. He began to stutter something about not knowing what I was \ntalking about, but I cut him off. It was written all over his panicked face; he had \nseen them. \nI watched as he decided whether or not to try and run. There was a moment I \nwas sure he was going to literally bolt for the door, but instead he sighed and \nnodded his head. It was four years ago, he told me, at The Good Ship in \nKilburn. Lee had been watching an up-and-coming metal band whose name he \ncould no longer recall – they'd been fine, a bit disappointing, so he was in a \nmood to finish his drink and leave. The rest of the audience seemed to be of a \nsimilar mind, so nobody noticed when a man climbed onto the stage, and set \nup a small keyboard. \nThe man was short, so Lee said, and painfully thin, wearing", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 1, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 4500}}
