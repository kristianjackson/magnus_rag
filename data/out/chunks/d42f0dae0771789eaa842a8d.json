I do not believe there was a sober person on the \nDorian when the night was over, and we slept easily. Well, the others slept \neasily, but they had not seen what I had seen. \nI didn’t hear the explosion myself. Dantez told me about it, as it had apparently \nwoken him and a few others of the crew. A big explosion, they said, further \ninto the port. We staggered onto the deck and, sure enough, smoke could be \nseen a little way off, its source hidden behind a wall of shipping containers. \nThere was no reason at that point to suspect it had anything to do with us, but \nI think somehow we all knew what it meant. That something had gone terribly \nwrong. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 141 – Doomed Voyage \nNobody could find Salesa or the captain. \nWe were still stood there, arguing amongst ourselves about what to do, when \nCaptain Gaultier made his dramatic reappearance. His clothes were torn and \nhis hair matted with blood. Before any of us could speak he commanded us to \nleave, to take up anchor and get out there. We did as we were ordered, and \nleft immediately. Some tried to ask the captain about Salesa, but he just shook \nhis head. He wasn’t making much sense. We managed to gather the two of \nthem had left early to deliver the artefact, but something had gone wrong. \nThere had been an argument. They had been betrayed. Salesa was dead. \nThe captain died soon after; the shrapnel trapped in his skull finally getting the \nbetter of him. \nWho they had been meeting, how exactly they had been betrayed, were \nsecrets he took with him to the grave. The crew fragmented after that. I think a \nfew of them managed to retain ownership of the Dorian, but they weren’t \npeople I was close to. So I jumped ship the next chance I got. \nAnd I have tried ever since then to leave those memories behind me. \nARCHIVIST \nThank you. \nFLOYD \n(Dazed) What... what…? \nARCHIVIST \n(Soothingly) You can go. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 141 – Doomed Voyage \nFLOYD \nErm… I, I don’t... \nARCHIVIST \nThank you Floyd. You’ve been… very helpful. \nFLOYD \nC— \nARCHIVIST \nIt’s alright, Floyd. You just… need a break. \nFLOYD \nYeah… Sure. \n[Ringing footsteps depart] \nBASIRA \nWhat the hell was that? \nARCHIVIST \nHe had information about Salesa. I thought it would help. \nBASIRA \nIs that why you were so keen on this ship? \nARCHIVIST \nI wasn’t sure. Just had a hunch there was something here. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 141 – Doomed Voyage \nBASIRA \nAnd what, you thought the best way to find it was by… slurping it out of his \nbrain? \nARCHIVIST \nHe didn’t exactly seem inclined to volunteer the information. Besides, you said \nI needed to be ready for Ny-Alesund. “Full power” I believe were your words. \nThe statement helped. \nBASIRA \nAnd now he’s going to see you in his dreams as he relives that for the rest of \nhis life. Because… because a tape recorder told you to do it? \nARCHIVIST \nYes, Basira, he is. And I am sorry about that. But we needed it. \nAnyway you’re the one who wants to be like Gertrude. You think she’d give a \ndamn about a few bad dreams? \nBASIRA \nNo. \nARCHIVIST \nNo. She got the job done, and didn’t care about the cost. \nBASIRA \nBut I thought you did.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 4, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 3187}}
