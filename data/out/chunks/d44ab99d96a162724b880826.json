The Magnus Archives. Episode one hundred and sixty-\nfive: \"Revolutions.\" \n[Theme finishes] \n[Tape clicks on] \n[A wasteland wind blows; in the distance the ‘Unknowing’ music \nplays and large metal gears creak; faint screams are peppered \nthroughout] \nMARTIN \nWow. \nARCHIVIST \nI told you. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 165 – Revolutions \n2 \nMARTIN \nI mean, yeah, but when you said big— \nARCHIVIST \nI meant big. \nMARTIN \nYeah, but, I mean, how big is it, actually? \nARCHIVIST \nI-it doesn't really work like that. \nMARTIN \nYeah, figures. \nARCHIVIST \nIf you tried to measure the diameter, I, uh, probably only be a half mile or so. \nBut the curve doesn't work quite right, and if you stayed at the same spot, just, \nhopped on a horse or let it carry you round, it… might be days before you \npassed the same spot, or, uh… \nMARTIN \nOr you might never see the same spot again? \nARCHIVIST \nExactly. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 165 – Revolutions \n3 \nMARTIN \nMm. Yeah. I think I'm starting to get it. \nARCHIVIST \nGood. \nMARTIN \nBut — you said we needed to go through these places. Is that even gonna work \nhere? \nARCHIVIST \n(Squeaky breath) Uh- We need to go through them… metaphorically. \n(Small confused sound from Martin) \nPsychologically we need to experience them. \nMARTIN \nHm. (slowly) Y-you think we could… get… that experience just, walking along \nthe edge? Because, uh, I really don't like the look of those riders. \nARCHIVIST \nWould you believe me if I said they were the victims? \nMARTIN \nAt this point, I'm not even surprised. \nARCHIVIST \nEither way, best not to actually climb onto the thing if we could help it. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 165 – Revolutions \n4 \nMARTIN \nFine by me. (small laugh) Never really liked merry-go-rounds anyway. \nARCHIVIST \nNo? You gone on any recently? \nMARTIN \nWhat? Ah, no I don't think so, not since I was a kid. \nARCHIVIST \nHeh, I actually, uh… There's one at London Zoo, uh, was one at London Zoo. Big \nold thing. Went quite fast, actually. Su-surprisingly thrilling. \n(Martin lets out a laugh) \nARCHIVIST \nWhat? \nMARTIN \nSeriously?! \nARCHIVIST \nIt was years back, before the Institute. I… I was in a weird place. Had a good \ntime, though! \n(Martin laughs in surprise) \nMARTIN \nWell. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 165 – Revolutions \n5 \nARCHIVIST \nI mean, obviously I wouldn't want to ride this one; we've got quite enough \nthrills already. \nMARTIN \n(Teasing) You-you sure? I could speak to an attendant— \nARCHIVIST \n(Serious) I would advise against doing that. \nMARTIN \nSo you said the riders were the victims... where's the monster? \nARCHIVIST \nI'm hoping if we're quick we can avoid her notice. \nMARTIN \nHer? \nJ-John please don't tell me there's an evil clown doll down there, because— \nARCHIVIST \nNo. N-No, Nikola died with the Unknowing; it's, uh... (shaky inhale) an old \nfriend. \nMARTIN \n...Oh. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 165 – Revolutions \n6 \nARCHIVIST \nYeah. I'd really rather not deal with her if we can avoid it. \nMARTIN \nYeah, good call, um, in that case, do you want to… do your thing now then, \nbefore we start moving? But are we, close enough? \nARCHIVIST \nYes. Yes, I-I think so. Good idea. \nMARTIN \nThanks. \nARCHIVIST \nYou, uh. You might want to take a bit of a walk. This feels like a strange one. \nMARTIN \nWhat does… strange mean, with something like this? \nARCHIVIST \nDon't think you want to know. \nMARTIN \nGood point! Um, okay, well, uh, good luck; I'll be, uh, o-over there. \n[Martin walks away] \nARCHIVIST \nRight.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 0, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 3735}}
