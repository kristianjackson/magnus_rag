My lungs spasmed painfully, desperately trying to wring air out of \nthe warm, rancid water that filled them, and as I felt the water embrace me \nfully, pressing in on all sides, I gripped the last connection I had to the world I \nknew. The last thing I was conscience of was the water getting colder. \nI don’t remember them fishing me out of Regents Canal, or most of my \ntreatment, to be honest. At a certain point it all blurs together. I’m alive, that’s \nwhat matters, and I’ve been living with my sister and her husband for a month \nor two. She doesn’t believe me, of course, and is keen to put the whole thing \nbehind us, though I catch her staring at me sometimes. I suspect she thinks I \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 129 – Submerged \n15 \n \nmight have done it on purpose. But she doesn’t know. She doesn’t know what \nit’s like to really hear the rain. \nARCHIVIST \nStatement ends. \nOne thing that always strikes me when I read statements like this is the bias of \nsurvivorship. With one or two notable exceptions, the only statements the \nInstitute receives are those where the witness has successfully escaped \nwhatever terrible place or being has marked them for a victim. I wonder how \nmany don’t make it out? How many of those shapes in the water were once \njust like Mr. Shakya? Hm. Or perhaps I shouldn’t wonder. Even as I say it, I can \nfeel the knowledge pushing at my mind, eager to find a way in. But I don’t \nwant it. I don’t want to know. I don’t want to see. \nNo more than I wanted to see how Gertrude stopped The Buried and their \nritual, but that came to me as well. They called it the Sunken Sky, and she \ncalculated, correctly, that casting a void-touched body down the pit at the right \ntime would be enough to disrupt it... something she found in Jan Kilbride. But \nGertrude also realised that the body need not be alive. Or in one piece. She \nthought it was a mercy. It wasn’t. \nI don’t like this. I don’t like not being sure what’s going to be in my mind, what \nthoughts are mine and what are from... elsewhere, why I just know some \nstatements are what I should be reading. I assume this one is related to the \ncoffin, to Daisy. I haven’t heard from Basira since she left on whatever secret \nerrand, and I feel like I’m no closer to understanding any of this. I suppose if \nthis one managed to free himself from The Buried, to find a way out of \nwhatever part of Choke embraces drowning ... \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 129 – Submerged \n16 \n \nI need an anchor. I, I could go in myself... I could find her. Then I just need to \nget out. I need something out here, something I can know the way back to. I \ndon’t know what, but... it’s a start. \nEnd recording. \n[Tape clicks off] \n[The Magnus Archives Theme – Outro] \nThe Magnus Archives is a podcast distributed by Rusty Quill and licensed under \na Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Sharealike 4.0 International \nlicence. \nToday’s episode was written by Jonathan Sims and directed by Alexander J \nNewall. \nIt featured: Jonathan Sims as the Archivist and Alexander J Newall as Martin \nBlackwood.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 6, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 3074}}
