I \nlooked up to see Michael, reaching into my shoulder. Its fingers were long and \ndistorted as they reached through my skin, cutting it like paper. I screamed. \nAfter a few seconds, it withdrew its hand. Held there was a single silver worm, \nwriggling pathetically in its grip. I hadn’t even felt the thing burrowing into my \narm. \nAfter that it’s all a bit of blur. I remember I was going to phone the police, but \nTimothy Hodge’s corpse was gone, and I was worried about trespassing, so I \njust sort of wandered away. Michael, or whatever it was, had gone as well. \nEventually I found my way back to the Institute, where I must have woken up \nMartin and, well, here we are. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG026 – A Distortion \n13 \n \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nYes, I suppose we are. \n \nSASHA \nSo what do you think? \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nI, uh... I don’t really know. We can look into it more later. \n \nSASHA \nI should really quit, you know. We, we all should. I don’t think this a normal \njob. I, I don’t think this is a safe job. \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nYou’re probably right. Do you want to quit? SASHA No. I’m just… I’m just too \ndamned curious, I suppose. You? \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nNo. Whatever’s going on, I need to know. Get some rest. \n \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG026 – A Distortion \n14 \n \n[CLICK] \nStatement ends. \nObviously there is little we can really do to follow up Sasha’s experience. If it \nwas any of the others I might have cause to doubt, but she has always been \nthe most level-headed of the team, and if she says that this is what happened, \nthen I believe her. \nThis does at least explain what happened to Timothy Hodge, whose \ndisappearance shortly after making his statement in late 2014 has been \nsomething of a concern since I discovered it. It seems odd how different the \neffect of Prentiss’... infestation was on him and Harriet Lee, but without more \ninformation I don’t have a working theory on why that might have been. \nThe thing that most disquiets me about Sasha’s statement is this ‘Michael’. She \nseems pretty convinced that he was not human, at least not in the \nconventional sense. Almost every statement I’ve catalogued has engaged with \nthe paranormal in some form of antagonistic relationship. The idea that there \nare things out there like that that want to help us... For some reason, that \nmakes me more uncomfortable than the worm-infested creature stalking the \nInstitute. \nSasha has taken a few days off to recuperate, and I’m having a word with Elias \nabout getting some extra CO2 fire extinguishers for the Archive. \nRecording ends. \n[The Magnus Archives Theme - Outro] \n \nThe Magnus Archives is a podcast distributed by Rusty Quill and licensed under \na creative commons attribution, non-commercial share alike 4.0 international", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 6, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 2774}}
