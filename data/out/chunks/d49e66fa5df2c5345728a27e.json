I never had much to begin with, and after I \nwas let go at the cafe, I couldn’t afford to keep my home. They didn’t even try \nto pretend it wasn’t because my burned face would scare away customers. I’ve \nended up living with my father again, who has been understanding about the \nsituation, though even he can’t bring himself to meet my eye most days. The \nworst part is, looking back, I’m still not sure what I would have done \ndifferently, were I to do it all again. Even after everything the police told me \nabout her death and the hand, I don’t know if I would have had it in me to \nresist. I just couldn’t avoid being drawn in, like a moth to the flame. \n \nARCHIVIST \nStatement ends. \n \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG067 – Burning Desire \n \n10 \n \nA rather different perspective on the woman known as Agnes Montague, or \nAgnes Fielding, depending on who you ask, although hardly a reliable account, \nsteeped as it is in messy obsessions and confusion. Still, if the bald man with \nthe lantern is, as I suspect, Diego Molina, it would indicate a link between his \nnotable obsession with burning and Agnes, who apparently had not \ninconsiderable abilities in that area. I can’t help but wonder if Arthur Nolan, \nthe Hive’s landlord, was one of the other members of that little group. I do not \nknow if they have a name as such, but given the evidence of organisation and \nthe indications of worship, I have started to refer to them in my notes as ‘The \nCult of the Lightless Flame’, and I believe they may also be connected to the \nritual circle found in Scotland by Jason North. I’ve been, as yet, unable to find \nany other details on them with the information I have. \n \nMost of the information here has already been covered following the account \nof Agnes’ time in Hill Top Road, but Martin has been able to make contact with \nMr Barnabas by email. He’s apparently been doing much better in the years \nsince his statement, having received some reasonably successful plastic \nsurgery. He was unable to provide much more information than the above, but \nupon Martin’s asking if Agnes had mentioned her childhood at all, he did recall \nher briefly alluding to being adopted. \n \nTim also got in contact with Dalia Okonjo, who confirmed what we had \nsuspected, that the woman known as Agnes Montague had visited The Canyon \nCafe for a decade and a half, apparently without ageing a day. I am now \nconvinced that this is the same Agnes who grew up in Hill Top Road, though \nexactly what she is or why she seemed to retain her youth remains a mystery. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG067 – Burning Desire \n \n11 \n \nLike everything else around here. Still, she is dead, as is Diego Molina. I can \nonly hope that prevents them from causing further problems. \n \nEnd recording. \n \n[Tape clicks off. Tape clicks on.] \n \nELIAS \nJohn, there’s nothing down there. \n \nARCHIVIST \nYou know that’s not true. I told you what happened. \n \nELIAS \nYou told me you wandered around in the dark for hours at a time, shortly after \nsuffering an incredibly traumatic experience. \n \nARCHIVIST \nSo, you’re saying I imagined it? \n \nELIAS \nIt’s a possibility. The other possibility is that there’s something very dangerous \ndown there. Neither makes me particularly inclined to unlock it. \n \nARCHIVIST \nSo what do you plan to do about it? Send someone else? \n \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG067 – Burning Desire \n \n12 \n \nELIAS \nWe really don’t have the budget for that. \n \nARCHIVIST \nSo nothing. You’re just going to leave it. \n \nELIAS \nFor now, I think that’s for the best. \n \nARCHIVIST \nPlease Elias, I need to know. \n \nELIAS \n(Sighs) You really think that this will help? \n \nARCHIVIST \nYes. Yes, it’s getting harder and harder to work down there without being sure \nof... what’s underneath me. So either give me the key or find a new Archivist. \n \nELIAS \nOh good Lord, don’t be so dramatic, John. You know how hard it would be to \nreplace you. \n \nARCHIVIST \nI... I don’t, actually. But thank you, I suppose. \n \nELIAS", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 5, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 3987}}
