And I’d long \nsince decided with this class, that if I couldn’t see or hear it, I didn’t care. \nThen Erika Mustermann held up her heart and looked at me. I began to get \nthat sinking feeling in the pit of my stomach as she asked me “How does the \nheart pump blood?” I started to explain the biological mechanisms of the heart \npumping, when she shook her head slowly and said, “What does it look like?” \nAnd then, when I didn’t answer, “Is it like this?” \nThe heart in her hand began to spasm. Not like the regular, rhythmic pulse of a \nheartbeat, but like a balloon being rapidly squeezed at one end. Bits of it \nswelled and stretched and distorted seemingly at random, and blood began to \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG034 – Anatomy Class \n11 \n \nflow haphazardly from the ventricles, dripping down Erika’s forearm and \ndribbling onto the floor. \nI stood there speechless, staring at this horrible miracle, from when behind her \nI see Fulan raise his heart, saying, “That’s not what it’s like.” And blood starts \nto gush from all over his heart in tiny geysers, shooting in every direction. Soon \neach of them is holding a heart up, each pumping and throbbing differently, \nblood leaking, spurting out of them in a different way, a different nightmare. \nThey wanted me to tell them which was right. \n(Nervous laugh) \n I don’t know how long I stared before I finally raised my hand to point at Jan \nNovak, who seemed to have the closest to an accurate impression of a regular \nhuman heartbeat. Then I turned and walked out of the lab. \nI spent the rest of the day sat in the staffroom, waiting for someone to come \nrunning in, screaming about the lab being full of blood. I expected questions I \ncouldn’t answer and immediate termination. But nothing happened. No-one \ncame. When I returned to the lab several hours later, there was no sign of any \nblood, except for the tiniest speck, dried into a tile crack in the corner. Unless \nthat, that had been there before? I don’t know. My shoes were still speckled \nwith blood, though, so I know I wasn’t hallucinating it. I checked with Dr. Gill, \nwho confirmed that she could see the spots, though I neglected to tell her it \nwas blood. I had no intention of inviting further questions. \nI missed the next three tutorials. I just stayed at home. But something wouldn’t \nlet me just simply let it go. Finally, I made a decision. I wanted to see where \nthey lived. I felt like I needed to, for some reason. Needed to see if they existed \noutside of my class, outside of my mind. I asked Elena and, irregular as it was, \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG034 – Anatomy Class \n12 \n \nshe gave me the address. It didn’t surprise me to find out they all lived in the \nsame place. A semi-detached house on Kingsland Road in Newham. I’m afraid I \ndon’t remember the number, and the details have disappeared from the \ncollege systems. \nThe house itself was run down, as might have been expected, and I must have \nspent a good fifteen minutes just stood in front of it, waiting for the courage to \napproach. Finally, I knocked on the door. The wood was old and dry, and some \nflaked off under my knuckles. It opened immediately, and there stood Jan \nNovak. When she saw me, her mouth twisted into something I think was \nmeant to be a smile. \n“Hello,” she said, “have you come to give us more lessons? We would like to \nlearn about the liver.” Her eyes locked onto my abdomen. I was about to reply \nwhen a muffled scream of pain came from somewhere deep inside the house. \nIt sounded ragged, like whoever was crying out had been gagged. I looked to \nJan Novak, who showed no indication she had heard it, still staring at where I \nhad taught her my liver would be. I ran, and she watched me go without \nmoving. \nI did call the police, but they just told me that the house was currently \nunoccupied, and they’d found no evidence that there had been anyone \npresent. I took great pains never to see the class again. I avoided all tutorials, \nand simply waited until the end of term. I haven’t seen them since. \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nThat’s it?", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 5, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 4067}}
