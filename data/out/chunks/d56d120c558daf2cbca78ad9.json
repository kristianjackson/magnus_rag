I’ve \nbeen meaning to come in ever since that callout. \nARCHIVIST \nMm. Yes. S-So um… so no-one is helping you with Gertrude’s case? No \noversight? \n \nBASIRA \nNot really. I tried making the argument that the murder didn’t seem to connect \nto any of your ‘paranormal business’, at least not directly, but nope. I’ve got a \nshot corpse, three boxes of cassettes, and Daisy, who’s CID now, which I \nsuppose means it’s technically her problem, but she’s now the only detective \nwho’s already sectioned so she’s always way too busy. As far as I know, neither \nof us have even had a chance to actually start listening to the tapes. \n \nARCHIVIST \nInteresting. Uh, listen— \n[CLICK] \n \n[CLICK] \n \nARCHIVIST \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG043 – Section 31 \n12 \n \nObviously further investigation of the police cases to which Ms Hussain refers \nis out of the question. Ensuring that the breach of non-disclosure and \nspreading of confidential information remains hidden is our top priority in this \ninstance. Further investigation, however subtle, could put that in significant \ndanger. Beyond that, Ms Hussain did not appear to expect any such \ninvestigation. I can’t say I blame her. Much as I value the deductive powers of \nmy team, they are not trained detectives with the force of the Metropolitan \nPolice behind them, so I imagine there would be little more they could \nunearth. Certainly nothing worth the risk. \n \nIf nothing else, it appears we now have a name for our mystery burn victim \nfrom Case #0121102. Diego Molina. And I have a suspicion I know where he \ngot that book. It’s a shame he’s dead, of course, but a piece of the puzzle is \nnot something to be ignored. \nEnd recording. \n[CLICK] \n[CLICK] \nSupplemental. \nI have convinced Basira to give me access to the tapes. It won’t be many or \noften, as they are currently police evidence and thus hard to subtly remove, \nand she can’t necessarily guarantee the ones I get will be the most pertinent to \nthe case, but it is still a significant victory. I only ever spoke to Gertrude once \nor twice during her time as archivist. I-I was very new. I don’t remember what \nher voice sounded like. Part of me worries about what I might find on these \ntapes, but a bigger part of me worries I will find nothing. This uncertainty is \nwearing on me, and I don’t know how much more I can take. \nEnd supplemental. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG043 – Section 31 \n13 \n \n[CLICK] \n[The Magnus Archives Theme - Outro] \n \nThe Magnus Archives is a podcast distributed by Rusty Quill and licensed under \na creative commons attribution, non-commercial share alike 4.0 international \nlicense.
