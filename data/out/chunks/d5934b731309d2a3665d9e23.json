Right. \n(Sounds of Jonathan clearing their throat) \nMy name is Jonathan Sims. I work for the Magnus Institute, London, an \norganisation dedicated to academic research into the esoteric and the \nparanormal. \nThe head of the Institute, Mr Elias Bouchard, has employed me to replace the \nprevious Head Archivist, one Gertrude Robinson, who has recently passed \naway. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG001 – Anglerfish \n2 \n \nI have been working as a researcher at the Institute for four years now and am \nfamiliar with most of our more significant contracts and projects. Most reach \ndead ends, predictably enough, as incidents of the supernatural, such as they \nare - and I always emphasise there are very few genuine cases - tend to resist \neasy conclusions. \nWhen an investigation has gone as far as it can, it is transferred to the \nArchives. \nNow, the Institute was founded in 1818, which means that the Archive \ncontains almost 200 years of case files at this point. \nCombine that with the fact that most of the Institute prefers the ivory tower of \npure academia to the complicated work of dealing with statements or recent \nexperiences and you have the recipe for an impeccably organised library and \nan absolute mess of an archive. \nThis isn’t necessarily a problem – modern filing and indexing systems are a real \nwonder, and all it would need is a half-decent archivist to keep it in order. \nGertrude Robinson was apparently not that archivist. \nFrom where I am sitting, I can see thousands of files. Many spread loosely \naround the place, others crushed into unmarked boxes. A few have dates on \nthem or helpful labels such as 86-91 G/H. Not only that, but most of these \nappear to be handwritten or produced on a typewriter with no accompanying \ndigital or audio versions of any sort. In fact, I believe the first computer to ever \nenter this room is the laptop that I brought in today. \nMore importantly, it seems as though little of the actual investigations have \nbeen stored in the Archives, so the only thing in most of the files are the \nstatements themselves. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG001 – Anglerfish \n3 \n \nIt is going to take me a long, long time to organise this mess. I’ve managed to \nsecure the services of two researchers to assist me. Well, technically three, but \nI don’t count Martin as he’s unlikely to contribute anything but delays. \nI plan to digitise the files as much as possible and record audio versions, \nthough some will have to be on tape recorder as my attempts to get them on \nmy laptop have met with... significant audio distortions. Alongside this Tim, \nSasha and, yes, I suppose, Martin will be doing some supplementary \ninvestigation to see what details may be missing from what we have. I’ll try to \npresent these in as succinct a fashion as I can at the end of each statement. I \ncan, unfortunately, promise no order in regards to date or theme of the \nstatements that are recorded, and can only apologise to any future researcher \nattempting to use these files for their own investigations. \nThat’s probably enough time spent making my excuses for the state of this \nplace, and I suppose we have to begin somewhere. \nStatement of Nathan Watts, regarding an encounter on Old Fishmarket Close, \nEdinburgh. Original statement given April 22nd 2012. Audio recording by \nJonathan Sims, Head Archivist of the Magnus Institute, London. \nStatement begins. \nJONATHAN SIMS \n(Read a loud from the archived witness statement of Nathan Watts) \nThis all happened a couple of years ago, so I apologise if some of the details are \na bit off. I mean, I feel like I remember it clearly but sometimes things are so \nweird that you start to doubt yourself. Still, I suppose weird is kind of what you \nguys do, right?", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 0, "chunk_count": 5, "chars": 4251}}
