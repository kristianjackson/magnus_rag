The deaths were about a \nfortnight apart, and when the third came in with the same symptoms, Bianca, \nthe coroner, called me in. For the last few years we’ve had an… arrangement. I \nslip her a bit of cash to feed a nasty habit she has, and if she’s called to any \ninquest which looks strange, I’m the first to know. \nDespite her weakness, Bianca is still a damn good coroner, and filled me in on \nthe details quickly. \nThe deaths had been carbon monoxide, she said, and by way of example \nshowed me a plastic cup full of blood. It was bright red. “Cherry red”, Bianca \ntold me, a good sign of CO poisoning. \n\nBut apparently, they hadn’t found any trace of the gas in the homes of the \ndeceased. Current theory was that someone was deliberately gassing people \nwhile they slept, but Bianca was adamant that, as far as she could tell, it \nseemed to have bypassed the lungs completely, appearing right into their \nblood as carbo-haemoglobin or whatever. From the look on their faces I could \ntell two things. It had hurt. And they had never woken up. \nYou see why I thought this might be related? Well, hoped more than thought, \nmaybe. The manmade nature of it seemed like a potential link, but it had few \nof the other hallmarks. Still, I thought it was worth following up on. Finding \nwho was… killing these people in their sleep. \nIt’s odd, isn’t it? Sleep. That you can never remember or fully pin down the \nexact moment you lose consciousness. Just lying there, waiting to find yourself \nin a dream without the first clue or interest in how or when you got there. Or \nto find your eyes closed and force them open to sunlight and morning, only \nrealising that sleep has happened in retrospect. I wonder if… death is the same \nway? No clear dividing line, just… gone, only to realise after it’s happened, \nexcept for the fact that there isn’t an after. Is that a comforting thought or a \nterrifying one? Depends on who you are, I suppose. It bothered me when I was \nyoung. If I thought too hard about the concept of sleep, of exactly what it was, \nI would worry myself, and end up having to turn the light on, and read for an \nhour or two. Everyone always talks about how they want to die in there sleep, \nbut honestly, I think that’s the death that scares me the most. \nBut that’s a meditation for another day. As far as these deaths were \nconcerned, I was confident there was something turning up in people’s houses \nand doing this to them. My first thought was a direct manifestation, but the \nmore I looked into it, the more I suspected maybe it was some poor soul who \n\ngot in too deep. I don’t know if my little ‘theoretical’ is strong enough yet to \nstart taking avatars, but this one, as you’ve no doubt guessed, turned out to be \nTerminus. \nJustin Gough, his name was. He was admitted to Accident and Emergency at \nWhipps Cross Hospital about two months ago, suffering from – I’m sure it will \ncome as no surprise – acute carbon monoxide poisoning. He had been \ncamping, and taken a small barbeque into his tent to keep warm. And it… \nwarmed his lungs all the way to the hospital. He was terrified and \nunintelligible, and then he died. For fifty-two seconds. According to the duty \nnurse, that is how long Justin Gough was clinically dead, before they managed \nto restart his heart and get him on a breather machine. \nIt’s hard to scream with a breathing tube in you, but apparently he gave it a \nnoble attempt when he woke up. The nurse I talked to hadn’t been there, but \nhe had apparently had some sort of near-death experience, and had been \ndescribing awful visions to those attending him, muttering obliquely about \n“terrible things” he’d had to do to return, and prices that would need to be \npaid. \nNone of the staff who were present would willingly say much more about it, \nbut it had clearly shaken them. \nJustin Gough was discharged shortly after, and in rapid succession quit his job, \ndisappeared from social media, and cut off effectively all human contact. He \nbecame, to all intents and purposes, a recluse who hasn’t left the house since. \nOr so the neighbours would say. I had a suspicion that he was leaving, but by \nnight, and for a single, very specific purpose. To pay a debt. While many fall to", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 2, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 4319}}
