The dark lines of them bent away from me at \nharsh angles, but if I tried to approach them then, rather than becoming \nclearer, the trees would disappear back into the hazy night and I would lose \nthem. Kneeling down, I was surprised to realise that the ground I was now \nstanding on was not wet. The hard-packed earth was damp from the creeping \nmist but it did not appear to have been rained on. The despair I felt was quickly \nturning into fear, and I kept moving forward, further into the fog. \nI realised afterwards that the night should have been far too dark to see the \nfog. There were no lights there to show it, and the moon had been shrouded in \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG013 – Alone \n11 \n \nstorm clouds all night, but despite this I could clearly see it. Shifting, slate-grey \nand smelling of nothing at all. As I walked I saw more shapes nearby. Dark slabs \nof stone, sticking out of the ground, leaning and broken. Gravestones. They \nspread out in all directions, and the gentle blurring of the mist did nothing to \nsoften the hard weight of their presence. I did not stop to read them. \nI kept moving until I reached the centre of what I can only assume was a small \ncemetery, and there I found a chapel. The top of its steeple was lost in the \ngloom and the windows were dark. I started to feel relief, as though I might \nhave found some sign of life at last. I began to circle it, moving around to \nwhere I assumed the front doors were. As I went I noticed that there was \nstained glass in the windows but, without any light from inside, I couldn’t make \nout the design. Finally, I came to front of the building, and I almost lost hope. \nWrapped around the handles of the entrance was a sturdy iron chain. I would \nfind no sanctuary here. \nI came very close to making a rash decision at that point. I started to shout, to \nscream for help, but the sound seemed muffled and disappeared almost as \nsoon as it left my throat. No-one heard me, but I continued shouting for some \ntime, just to hear the noise, even if it did seem to die as soon as it touched the \nfog. It was useless, though, and as I finished I felt the prickling damp flow in \nand out of my lungs. It was cloying and heavy and I decided I had to do \nsomething. I started to look around the ground for the heaviest rock I could \nfind. I was going to get inside that church, even if I had to break a window to \ndo it. Anything to get out of the fog. I was sure that eventually someone would \nfind me. \nI noticed that one of the graves had been slightly broken by age, and a small \nchunk of it could be seen on the ground. It had an engraving of a cross on it, \nand the weighty lump of stone now lay embedded in the graveyard soil. I bent \ndown to lift it, but as I did so I saw something that froze me in place. The grave \nwas open. And it was empty. \nIt wasn’t dug up, exactly. The hole was neat, square and deep, as though ready \nfor a burial. At the bottom there was a coffin. It was open, and there was \nnothing inside. I backed away, and almost fell into another open grave behind \nme. I started to look around the cemetery with increasing panic. Every grave \nwas open and they were all empty. Even here among the dead, I was alone.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 6, "chunk_count": 9, "chars": 3259}}
