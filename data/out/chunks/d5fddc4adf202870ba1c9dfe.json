Audio recording by Jonathan Sims, Head Archivist of the Magnus \nInstitute, London. \nStatement begins. \nARCHIVIST (STATEMENT) \nI should have come in to tell you people about this before really. I heard about \nyour institute back in the ‘80s and I thought, “Should I tell them”? But I didn’t. \nThought you’d be all about old castles and ancient cairns, not have any time \nfor weird goings-on in a suburban house in Oxford. And you’re academics as \nwell, so probably have more rigorous standards than one crackpot’s horror \nstory. Still, I saw last week that they were planning to build on that land again, \nanother house where the old Fielding place used to be. I don’t know, it’s not \nlike you’d have any power to stop the construction, but I just... I needed to tell \nsomeone about it, and you were less likely to throw me out on my ear than the \nplanning department of Oxford City Council. You see, I lived with Raymond \nFielding for almost three years, and believe me when I say that there is nothing \ngood that can come from disturbing that dreadful place. \nI was a bad kid. I’ve cleaned up my act in the 40-odd years since, but back then \nI was a little thug. Wasn’t entirely my fault; I came from a bad family. My \nfather left before I was born, and I’m not sure how much you know about \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 059 – Recluse \n3 \n \nsingle motherhood in the late ‘40s, but it was clearly hard enough that my \nmother ended up with a serious alcohol problem. I won’t go into the gory \ndetails of my childhood, but let’s just say it’s no surprise I was out of school \nand in the system before my 13th birthday. \nThey tried a few places to set me straight. Back then, these sorts of places \nweren’t quite as enlightened and the only life lesson I learned worth a damn \nwas how to take a beating. Finally, when I was 15, after the justice system was \nfinished with me for the third time, I was given the chance to re-enter society \nand offered a place at a halfway house on Hill Top Road. It’s weird, I’ve tried to \nget information on it so many times in the years since, but there’s nothing \nthere. It’s like it never existed. I mean, this was a long way pre-digital and files \ngot lost plenty, but it still bothers me. The most traumatic thing that ever \nhappened to me and, as far as any official record is concerned, I couldn’t have \neven been there. \nRaymond Fielding was younger than I expected. Every other place the people \nin charge had been old, leathery moralists with scowls on their faces and \ncallouses on their knuckles. A lot of ex-military types who would lecture for \nhours on how their wasted life had been saved by the discipline of the army \nand did their best to impose it on us. Ray, as he insisted we call him, was \ndifferent. He couldn’t have been much older than 30 and he let his brown hair", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 0, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 3542}}
