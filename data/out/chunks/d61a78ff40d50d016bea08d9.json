As I mentioned, \nafter a while the hunt became an addiction of its own. Of the two, I have \nalways found heroin the easier one to quit. Heroin is calm. It’s a small chunk of \npeace in a world that’s full of nothing but hard edges. It’s hard to put that \ndown permanently. But the hunt? The hunt is a purpose. It’s not just a way to \nget through the day; it’s a reason for there to be a day at all. I tried to give it up \nfor a while after Dupont, but it burned in me far deeper than any itch I got \nwhen I was clucking. \n\nThe Magnus Archives –056 – Children of the Night \n4 \n \nBack in ‘82 though, those addictions were running pretty much unchecked. It \nhad been several years since I had last found a vampire and every waking \nmoment I wasn’t high was spent in keen look-out for anything suspicious. I was \nin bad shape physically. I’d acquired an infection from injecting between my \ntoes which would eventually hospitalise me and lead to my losing two of them, \nthough I luckily kept the foot. At that point though, it just slowed me to a limp \nand caused me a reasonable amount of pain. Perhaps if I’d been faster, able to \nkeep up with Dupont more easily, I would have realised my mistake. Perhaps if \nmy mind hadn’t been so fogged with brown, I might have figured it out. Or \nperhaps if I hadn’t been so dead eager to kill another vampire. Any of these \nmight have saved him. Maybe even if he’d had a name that didn’t make me \nthink of Dracula. But none of those things were the case, so dwelling on them \nis pointless. \nI don’t know if Dupont was technically a mute or not. I’ve had no real \nexperience with the condition and he didn’t seem to have any problems with \nhis hearing. Either way, I never saw him speak, which by now I’m sure you \nknow is what I would consider a significant warning sign for vampirism. A \nfriend of mine I had shared a shelter with some weeks before, and who shared \na similar weakness for narcotics, had mentioned how amazing it was that his \ndealer was always able to know exactly what he was after without either of \n\nThe Magnus Archives –056 – Children of the Night \n5 \n \nthem saying a word. In retrospect, I should have realised that this didn’t \nexactly match the vampires I’d met before, who’d never displayed any sort of \nmind reading. But I was aching for a kill. \nThe kid who told me this was a weird one, must have been about 19 years old. \nTold everyone his name Stanley Kubrick. He was always making references to \nhis film career and I was never able to figure out if it was actually his real name \nthat he happened to share with the director, or if it was just some weird joke \nhe was really committed to. What struck me about him more than that though \nwere the scars on his neck. I later discovered they were from a dog attack \nwhen he was younger, but at the time, I was convinced they were connected \nto Dupont. \nSo, I found where Alard Dupont made his handovers in Piccadilly Gardens and I \nstarted to watch. He was surprisingly brazen about it, sat there on a park \nbench for hours, smoking or reading some magazine or other. I’d never seen a \nvampire read a magazine before, but I had seen them pantomime watching \ntelevision or reading a book to better blend in, so it didn’t raise any suspicions \nfor me. Then came the moment that fully convinced me that I had to kill \nDupont.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 1, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 3517}}
