I was wrong. When I told her, she got angry. Not the \nchill, disapproving anger I was used to from, but a genuine shouting rage. She \naccused me of throwing my life away, told me I’d regret it, and that Laurence \nwas good-for-nothing scum who’d drag me down and stop me achieving \nanything. I answered her in kind, and the argument that we had that night was \nthe last time I saw her for almost ten years. I’d try to convince myself that our \ndifferences were just that: we were simply two very different people. But \nsometimes I worry that the reason we could never get on was that we were far \ntoo much alike. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG077 – The Kind Mother \n3 \n \nFor instance, we were both far too stubborn for our own good. Maybe that’s \nwhy I stayed with Laurence through two affairs, as if accepting that I’d made a \nmistake would be letting her win. In the end I only left him when he was jailed \nfor embezzlement, eight years into our marriage. Even then, I didn’t want to \nspeak to her. Didn’t want to tell her she’d been right. It wasn't until my father \nhad his accident that I finally decided to try and make amends. \nMy father is a gentle man. To this day I couldn’t really tell you anything about \nhis thoughts or opinions on anything, as they were invariably bulldozed by my \nmother. He was a benign, ineffectual presence, always in the shadow. For all \nthat, I did love him; so when he fell from a ladder and ended up in wheelchair, \nI made the decision to try and reconnect with my parents. \nIt wasn’t easy. Beyond the greying of her hair, my mother hadn’t changed, and \nthe reconciliation I’d hoped for never really came. I spent my visits biting my \ntongue, or getting into vicious fights whenever I wasn’t able to. But I could \nalways see on my father’s face how much he liked to see me, how happy he \nwas to have our small family together again, so I persevered. I think she saw it \ntoo, to be honest, and whenever he wheeled himself painfully into the room, \nshe would try her best not to antagonise me. \nAfter a while we came to an uneasy peace. \nThere were practical issues as well. They’d retired to the small village of \nDraycott in the Somerset countryside, and as I lived in London and didn’t have \na car, it was two trains and a long bus ride anytime I wanted to see them. But I \nmade the effort. I even conceived a reason to go more often – I’ve been doing \nsome freelance work this summer for the British Library, recording and \ncompiling oral histories on various topics, and it so happened that during her \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG077 – The Kind Mother \n4 \n \ntime as an academic my mother had been something of an authority on English \nand Welsh folklore. In fact, one of the reasons she always gave for retiring out \nthere was how many myths and legends made their home in the area. So I \nproposed that I make some recordings of her, telling and discussing them for \nthe project. She agreed, though not before telling me how pointless the whole \nthing sounded, and over the last few months I saw them several times. My \nfather was happy, the recordings I got were surprisingly usable, and everything \nseemed to be getting better. \nTwo weeks ago I went to see them, and someone else opened the door. \nSomeone I didn't recognise. \nShe wore my mother's clothes, but they shouldn't have fitted her. My mother \nis tall, rail thin and always keeps her hair cut short, but the woman who \nanswered my knocking was shorter, rounded about the middle and wore her \ncurly white hair down almost to her shoulders. I had definitely never seen her \nbefore. I asked if my parents were home, and she laughed. It was a soft, joyful \nsound that was so unlike anything I expected to hear in that house that I had to \ntake a step back to collect my thoughts. My father wheeled round the corner \nand shouted a greeting as though everything was perfectly normal. He moved \nup beside the plump old woman standing in the doorway and looked at me, \nsmiling. The image made me feel queasy. I’m not even sure why, at this point I \nhad no reason to think this person was anything other than a friend of my \nparents, but something wasn’t right. \nI asked where my mother was, and they both got very quiet. I repeated the \nquestion with more force, and my father looked up to this strange woman in \nconfusion. She smiled sadly and stepped towards me, opening her arms as if to \nhug me, but I yelled at her t", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 1, "chunk_count": 5, "chars": 4500}}
