I couldn’t \nsee him or hear him or speak to him. Because… there was nobody there. The \nstaircase was empty, as he stretched his arm to gesture me closer. \nMy memory is not what it was. Some days it seems that damn poem is all I can \nremember. I know I had a family. I know I had a house. Was it in Antigonish? \nNo, that’s absurd. The man I didn’t meet had nothing to do with the poem, just \na, a coincidence. But I’m not sure… what else I know now; I’m not sure where \nelse I know now. And I’m unsure where I’ve ever been. I had a home. A house. \nI know it had at least two floors, because there were stairs. The stairs were \nreal. He wasn’t there, but the stairs were. At least to begin with. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG085 – Upon the Stair \n4 \n \nIt was dark when I didn’t see him, and I was about to walk up to bed. I \nremember being cold, damp. Had it been raining? No, the water was still. I \nwanted to be dry, to be warm in my bed. And I couldn’t, because in spite of his \nown absence, this man blocked the stairs. I think I would have asked others to \ntell me what or who they might or might not have seen, if that had been an \noption, and I didn’t, so I must have lived alone. I don’t know why the lights \nwere off, but the moon was bright and cast stark shadows upon the empty \nfloor where this figure stood. \nFor obvious reasons I can’t describe him. I can barely describe his absence. I \ncould try to say that his… hypothesis was tall and wide. Conceptually, he could \nhave had arms that stretched away from a soft-looking torso, with stubby \nfingers that did not grip the banisters tight enough to splinter. If he had had a \nface, it would have been unremarkable, with a small, plump mouth that failed \nto quite turn into a smile. \nHe didn’t speak, so I couldn’t hear his offer to join him on the staircase. But I \naccepted. I don’t know if I was just desperate to try and get up and into my \nbed, or if I was… generally curious as to what this man had to offer me, when \nhe didn’t even have enough wherewithal to exist. So, I placed my foot on the \nfirst step and I began to walk. If he’d been there it might have been hard to get \npast his bulk, but as it was I continued up without any problems. \nThe staircase in my house was not long, and it wasn’t steep, and it went \nstraight up to the landing with only a single right-angle turn. It was not a spiral \nstaircase, so after walking down that corkscrew for almost a half hour, I knew it \ncouldn’t be mine. The man hadn’t come with me, of course, so I wasn’t able to \nask how it was he could always stay three steps in front of me without once \nmoving his legs. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG085 – Upon the Stair \n5 \n \nI walked and I walked. And then I didn’t walk, and that got me moving much \nfaster. The walls didn’t look like my house, because there weren’t any, so it \nwas hard to tell what they did look like. Eventually I must have reached the \nend, because I woke up the next morning in my bed, and my bed was at the \nend of the staircase that was there, so I assume it was also at the end of the \none that wasn’t. \nThe next few days are hard for me to remember, because they happened, and \ngenuine recollections slip through my mind like rippling glass. But the man \ndidn’t come back. He didn’t come back every night. He didn’t come back until I \nmade… a horrid mistake. I called to him. I stood on the landing and shouted at \nhim to go away. I asked him if he was there. I demanded he show himself. All \nutterly impossible, of course. I was shouting at nobody but myself, and so it \nwas into my own mind that my curses and pleas burrowed and nested. As he \nwasn’t there, I have no way of telling how many teeth were on show when he \nsmiled at me. \nAfter that, it became hard to tell where he failed to begin, and easier to tell \nwhere I ended. People would forget me, but that was alright, because only real \npeople care about who remembers them. And I was no longer among their \nnumber. I would have whole days where I failed to exist, a feeling so entirely \nalien that I am glad I had no stomach from which to throw up. And as I existed \nless and less, the man ceased to exist less and less… until… I remember the first \ntime he was really in my house, and I wished for nothing more than that I had \nhands with which to strangle him. \nMy parents were the worst. They came for dinner once, shortly after I had \ncalled to him. They looked so confused when I served them their meal, and the \nconversations would die after on", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 1, "chunk_count": 5, "chars": 4500}}
