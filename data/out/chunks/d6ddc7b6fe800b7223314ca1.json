Maybe she’s with him. Or he killed her, too. Either \nway, quicker I find him, the better for her, so if there is anything you’re not \ntelling me… \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG082 – The Eyewitnesses \n6 \n \nMARTIN \nNo. I just… Bring her back safe, okay? (Pause) I’ll send Tim in. \n[Martin leaves, the door opening and closing.] \nDAISY \nTim Stoker. (Pause) That your name? \nTIM \nYeah. \nDAISY \nYou want me to leave this running? \nTIM \nNo. You can turn it off. \n[Tape clicks off. Tape clicks on.] \nDAISY \nHm. \nTIM \nHuh. Seems about right. Look, just… just leave it on, or do you want to do this \nsomewhere else? \nDAISY \nIt’s fine. \nTIM \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG082 – The Eyewitnesses \n7 \n \nSuppose you want my statement? \nDAISY \nI just need anything you know on the possible whereabouts of Jonathan Sims. \nAnywhere he feels safe, any friends or associates he might turn to? \nTIM \nNo. \nDAISY \nYou’re sure? Nothing that might help me find him? If you’re hiding something \nout of some sort of loyalty… \nTIM \n(Laughs) Look, if I knew, I’d tell you. We haven’t talked too much lately. \nDAISY \nAnd you haven’t seen Sasha James either? \nTIM \nNo. You think she’s dead? \nDAISY \nCan’t say yet. But looking at it, yeah, I think Sims killed her, too. \nTIM \nSounds right. More bodies for the archive. \nDAISY \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG082 – The Eyewitnesses \n8 \n \nYou’ve got quite a turnover. Anything you want to tell me about it? \nTIM \nYeah, don’t take a job here. \nDAISY \nOh… You’re done, Mr. Stoker. Send in Bouchard. \n[Tim leaves, the door opening and closing.] \nDAISY \nElias Bouchard? \nELIAS \nCorrect. \nDAISY \nSit. \n[The chair moves as Elias sits.] \nELIAS \nSo, what can I do to help? You want my account? My sworn testimony? My \nstatement? \nDAISY \nWhat is…? No. Just a couple of questions. \nELIAS \nOf course. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG082 – The Eyewitnesses \n9 \n \nDAISY \nI don’t suppose you know how to turn this off? \nELIAS \nOh, leave it running. I’m sure John will want to review the tapes when he gets \nback. \nDAISY \nSo you don’t think he did it? \nELIAS \nKilled a man in cold blood? Certainly not. He doesn’t have the stomach for it. \nDAISY \nPeople can surprise you. \nELIAS \nIn John’s case, I rather hope so. \nDAISY \nYou want him to be a murderer? \nELIAS \nHave you had any luck identifying the body yet? (Pause) Well? \nDAISY \nI’m the one asking the questions. \nELIAS \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG082 – The Eyewitnesses \n10 \n \nVery well, then I suppose this interview is over. Unless you care to arrest me? \nDAISY \n(Pause) The victim isn’t someone we have on file. Doesn’t match any missing \npersons. Still a John Doe. \n(Elias laughs) \nI say something funny? \nELIAS \nNothing. Just remembering an old joke. \nDAISY \nRight. So. Do you know anything about the current whereabouts of Jonathan \nSims? Anywhere he might be staying? Any friends he might have contacted? \nELIAS \nI do. \nDAISY \n(Pause) Well? \nELIAS \nI was wondering. Is it worth it? Operating the way that you do? \nDAISY \nJust answer the question. \nELIAS \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG082 – The Eyewitnesses \n11 \n \nDoes the lack of oversight make up for the lack of support? \nDAISY \nWhat do you know about the current whereabouts of Jonathan Sims? \nELIAS \nEverything. I know exactly where he is and who is with him. But I don’t think \nI’m going to tell you. \nDAISY \nI can drag this down to the station if you want, you weird little freak. Maybe \nSims didn’t do this alone. \nELIAS \nPlease, Detective Tonner. You don’t want this to happen in the police station \nany more than I do. Your superiors, exactly how aware are they of what you’re \ndoing right now? \nDAISY \nThey know enough. They got a call and sent me down here. That’s how it \nworks. \nELIAS \nAnd then they don’t ask any questions, as long as you keep it far away from \nofficial police channels. \nExcept your partner leaving has made you sloppy.
