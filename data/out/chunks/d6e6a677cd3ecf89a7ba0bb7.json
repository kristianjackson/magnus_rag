No-one had heard the sound of work being \ndone in there, and the rumour was that Dexter had finally lost it and the \nworkshop was empty. We had run through all the scenes that could be done \nwithout it, and everyone was getting really impatient. \n \nFinally, Dexter announced it was time for the unveiling, for the spider, for \nKumo to make its appearance. We were all excited as we assembled outside \nthe workshop, but there was a nervous energy in the air that day. It was about \nas cold as it ever gets in LA, but the shiver that passed through us when he told \nus it was time was something else entirely. \n \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG110 – Creature Feature \n \n11 \n \nDexter told us the actors would see it first. He gave no reasoning for this, and \nsilenced the outcry from a couple of the crew with a vicious glare. He then \ngathered up the cast and, with Brandon leading them, took them through a \nsmall door in the side of the workshop, and they disappeared inside. \n \nI’ve thought back over those minutes so many times, trying to decide if I’d \nheard or seen anything that might have explained what happened inside that \nbuilding, but in the end, I have to admit that I didn’t. Minutes passed, then half \nan hour, as we waited impatiently for Dexter or the others to return. \n \nIt seems like a sick cosmic joke that that was the day the press broke the news \nof Neil Lagorio’s death. Half an hour after the cast walked into that building, \none of the grips stumbled across the news story whilst idly checking his phone. \nLagorio had been privately suffering from Parkinson’s for almost a decade and \nhad been bedridden in his Connecticut home for the last year. We knew then \nthat whatever was going on inside that building, it was not Neil Lagorio \ndebuting a new animatronic creation. Once again, all eyes turned to me. \n \nI’m still not entirely sure what I saw on the other side of that door. I probably \nsaw nothing, like the cops who arrived shortly afterwards. The place was \nentirely empty, after all, just as the rumours had always said. But I wouldn’t be \nhere, talking to you, if I thought that was true, now would I? Because I \nremember that first moment, that instant of looking up when I first entered. I \nsaw it, perfectly interwoven, with a hundred cocoons writhing and dangling, \nstretching out far above me. And in its centre, those black and shining eyes \nthat focused on my entrance, the legs that worked so fast as to be a blur, the \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG110 – Creature Feature \n \n12 \n \nfangs that dripped their poison onto Dexter Banks. Then in a moment it was all \ngone, scuttling up and into nowhere, pulling its impossible web behind it. \n \nI never knew how to describe my relationship with Dexter, and I still don’t. \nHow he was complicit, and how much he was simply caught in his own \nneuroses and fears, I don’t know. I know he didn’t deserve what happened to \nhim. \n \nI found the book, by the way, and I burned it. If I ever track down the man who \nused to own it, I might just burn him too. \n \nStatement ends. \n \nMARTIN \nI think Alexia might be a bit too late for that. I mean, I think it sounds like a \nJurgen Leitner book. About spiders. Huh. Glad John didn’t have to read this one \nanyway; I know he’s not a fan. Although this one wasn’t too bad, actually, I— \nAh, anyway. \n \nThis is, I suppose, one explanation for the disappearance of Dexter Banks, \nalong with almost a hundred cast members, back in 2012. There’s not a lot I \ncan really add that hasn’t already been dissected by a hundred different \ntabloids, magazines and mystery shows. Even the, um, arachnid angle has been \ncovered, as it seems that when we weren’t a lot of help, Alexia Crawley told \nher full story to the press. She was not treated kindly and refuses to discuss the \nevents any further. Poor thing.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 5, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 3907}}
