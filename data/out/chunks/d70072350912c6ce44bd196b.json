The only body they found was that of Raymond Fielding. \nAll that was left was a badly-charred skeleton, missing its right hand. \nThat was the history of the place, as the nurse told it to me. Once the rubble \nhad been cleared away, the land had become tied up in legal complications \nrelating to the ownership and had remained so until earlier last year. She asked \nme not to let anyone else know she’d been talking about it, as she didn’t want \npeople to think she had been spreading stories. I told her I’d keep quiet and \nshe left. I didn’t see her again and was discharged soon afterwards. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG008 – Burned Out \n9 \n \nI rested at home for a couple of days but I find forced inactivity very boring and \nmy head was feeling fine so I decided to go back to work. By all rights I should \nprobably have avoided returning to Hill Top Road, but I found myself resenting \nhow the house made me feel. I didn’t believe in ghosts, to be honest I’m still \nnot sure I do, and had been assured by the doctor that I wasn’t displaying any \nother symptoms of schizophrenia, so there was no reason for me to feel this \ngnawing apprehension. I convinced myself that the only way to banish the \nfeeling was to return and finish the job that I started. So that’s what I did, \nalthough I was careful to work only in daylight now and tried to avoid being \nalone. \nEven so, there were occasional moments when I would find myself the only \none working in a room, or when silence fell across the building. And then I \nwould smell it again, that whiff of burnt hair, or catch a glimpse of brown \npigtails disappearing around a corner. As the job drew towards a close, it \nbecame harder to avoid working there after dark, until I lost track of time \ncompletely one afternoon and looked up to see that not only had night fallen \nbut I was the only one left in the building. Almost as soon as I realised this I \nbegan to sweat. At first I thought it was nerves or even a panic attack at finding \nmyself alone, but it was the heat; this warmth that seemed to start in my \nbones and radiate out through me. I took off my hat and jacket, but I just got \nhotter and hotter until it felt like I was cooking from the inside. I tried to \nscream but I couldn’t find my breath, I couldn’t move. I was burning up. \nThere was a knock at the door and the feeling abruptly vanished. I was cold \nagain, lying on the bare floor. I struggled to my feet as the knock came again. \nMy hand shook as I opened it. By now I didn’t know what to expect. Would it \nbe Raymond again? Agnes?
