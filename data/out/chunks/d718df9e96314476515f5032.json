It just had a normal, wooden fire door, but \nmy hand still hesitated as I reached to open it. I knew it was empty, by now I \nwas sure she wasn’t home. Still, I was starting to feel that fear that Kathy had \ndescribed, and I saw that my hand was shaking. I tried to ignore it, grit my \nteeth, and I opened the door. \nThe room inside was empty, as I had thought. But it wasn’t just that Natalie \nwas out; it was completely bare. No furniture, no possessions, nothing. The \ncarpet had been torn up, leaving the bare floorboards exposed and the \nwallpaper had been stripped from the wall. All of it had been stuffed and \nnailed up against the room’s only window, leaving it completely covered. No \nlight from outside got through, and the torch was the only reason I could see at \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG025 – Growing Dark \n8 \n \nall. I started to look around for any clue to what Natalie had been doing, or \nwhere she had been. \nIn the corner, half-slipped between the boards, I spotted a piece of paper. It \nwas small and thick, and seemed to have something written on it. Picking it up, \nI saw it had three words on it: Hither Green Dissenters. The other side had a \nsymbol of some kind, written in thick marker pen: a curved line, with four \nstraight lines coming off one side of it. Like a closed eye. I kept the paper, and \nyour Institute can have it if you want. It’s not like the police were interested in \nit. \n \n \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG025 – Growing Dark \n9 \n \nI called Kathy to tell her what I’d found. She was worried about me, but also \nabout Natalie. Whatever this weird church was that she’d joined, I think we \nboth reckoned it might be bad for her. Really bad. Kathy wanted to phone the \npolice, but I told her there just wasn’t enough for it to be a crime. Not yet. I \ntold her I’d keep looking. I might have lied, to be honest, and said I was just \ngoing to look around the house more, but… well, I did a search for Hither \nGreen Dissenters and it looked like there was an old abandoned chapel, the \nHither Green Dissenters Chapel, in a graveyard near Lewisham. I had decided \nthat I needed to check it out. No idea what I was hoping to find. Enough to call \nthe police in, I guess. \nBy now it was just past midnight; the drive down wasn’t too difficult. There \nwas still that thickness to the night, a heavy gloom that deadened all light. Like \nsomeone had turned the brightness down on London. I found a parking spot \nnot too far away from Hither Green Cemetery, and started to walk towards it. \nThe iron gates stood wide open, so I went in. \nThe graveyard itself wasn’t as bad as I’d feared. If anything it felt quite \npeaceful. The darkness seemed right for it, and the stones stood silent and \nfirm. I walked along the path, until my light fell across a small building. The \nchapel. It was tiny, surrounded by temporary fencing that looked like it had \nbeen there long enough to become permanent. It had a single, pointed bell \ntower, and the windows were covered with old boards that looked like they’d \nseen the worst of the rain. There was only a single entrance, a pair of double \ndoors set at the front. To my surprise, they stood open. I called out Natalie’s \nname, shouted and asked if anyone was in there, but there was only silence.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 4, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 3287}}
