Time you went for a walk. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 168 – Roots \n2 \nMARTIN \nYeah, about that... You sure you'll be okay on your own? \nARCHIVIST \nUm, I always have been. \nMARTIN \nOkay. I mean, well, I don't like this place. \nARCHIVIST \nOnce again Martin, that's… sort of the point! (small laugh) \nMARTIN \nYeah, yeah, I know, alright; I get it; it's just— it's more than that. This place, \nwhat did you call it, the… (fumbling) the Rotten Core? \nARCHIVIST \nThe Corpse Roots. \nMARTIN \nYeah, yeah, that. Well, it, it feels… I don't know, it feels like it's— \nARCHIVIST \nWaiting. \nMARTIN \nYeah! Waiting. \n[A pointed wood creak] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 168 – Roots \n3 \n(Beat) \nMARTIN (CONT'D) \nThis is the one with the, um, the death guy, isn't it? \nARCHIVIST \nThis is Oliver Banks' domain, yes. \nMARTIN \n…So it's him that's waiting. \nARCHIVIST \nNot just him, but… Yes. \nMARTIN \nSo, are you gonna smite him, then? \nARCHIVIST \n...Um.... \nMARTIN \nJohn? \n(The Archivist sighs softly) \nMARTIN (CONT'D) \nJohn, I said are you going to s— \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 168 – Roots \n4 \nARCHIVIST \nI heard you the first time. \nMARTIN \nAnd? \nARCHIVIST \nI, I don't know. \nMARTIN \nWhy not? Can't you just do what you did with that Sasha-thing, make the Eye \nsee him and all that? \nARCHIVIST \nI... could, I think. \nMARTIN \nCool, so what's the problem, then? Take another monster off the hit list, job \ndone. \nARCHIVIST \nIt's not, that simple? \nMARTIN \nWell, what does that mean. \n(Insistent) What does that mean, John? What, what happened to Kill Bill? \nJohn? John, you said— \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 168 – Roots \n5 \nARCHIVIST \nI know what I said, and I don't… (sigh) I don't know, Martin. I just, I don't think \nhe's— I don't know; I don't think he's evil. \nMARTIN \n(Sarcastic) Oh, yeah, sure; he's probably a really kind, benevolent ruler of a \nhellish fear prison. \nARCHIVIST \nIt's just— he helped me. Wh-when I was… \nHe woke me up. \nMARTIN \n(Flat, derisive) Wow. What a hero. \nARCHIVIST \nMartin? \nMARTIN \nWhat. \n(The Archivist makes an amused breath) \nWhat. \n(Beat) \nYeah, alright; I know; I'm sorry. \nARCHIVIST \n(Amused) Is there something you want to talk about? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 168 – Roots \n6 \nMARTIN \nNo, I'm, fine; it's fine; everything's fine! I'm sorry. \nARCHIVIST \n(Smug) …Martin… \nMARTIN \nI said it's fine. \nARCHIVIST \n(Smug) Are you jealous? \nMARTIN \nI told you not to know things about me! \nARCHIVIST \n(Laughing) I really didn't have to. \nMARTIN \nI, Y-you— good. 'Cause I'm definitely not. \nARCHIVIST \nAlright! \nMARTIN \nLook, I'm fine, alright? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 168 – Roots \n7 \nARCHIVIST \nYou said. \nMARTIN \n(Defensive) Yes, I did! And e- and even if I was jealous, I would be perfectly \njustified anyway, so! \nARCHIVIST \nBut you're not. \nMARTIN \nNo! I'm fine. \nARCHIVIST \nAlright! \nMARTIN \nGood! \nARCHIVIST \nGood! \nMARTIN \nGreat. \n(Beat) \nAlright, fine, yes, yes, I am jealous, alright? Yes, if you absolutely must know. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 168 – Roots \n8 \nARCHIVIST \nBecause, he woke me up. \n(Martin makes a couple of sounds of disbelief) \nMARTIN \nI was there weeks, and nothing. He talks to you for five minutes and suddenly \nyou're back on your feet and, bouncing around like a, like a spring chicken! \nARCHIVIST \n(Laughing) I mean, that's really not— \nMARTIN \nI mean, what's so special about him, that you wake up for him and not me, \nhm? Enlighten me. \nARCHIVIST \nI mean, that's… that's not really how it worked. It-It wasn't— \nLook. Martin, I'm sorry you feel that way, but I'm not going to kill a man just \nbecause you're jealous. \nMARTIN \nWhy not?! \n(Beat) \nYeah. Yeah, I know, I know, I know.
