So, I’ve decided to \nlet the tapes run. They’ve proved useful before, so... \nI did do a small bit of follow-up on Deborah Madaki, just for my own curiosity. \nShe didn’t go to Sannikov Land in the end. I don’t know, however, whether that \nwas because she decided not to, or because shortly after this statement was \ngiven they found the body of one Mary Roundall in her basement, and she has \nspent the last nine years in Eastwood Park Prison, where she remains to this \nday. I can’t find any evidence relating to the condition of the body, but I can \nimagine what a sculptor's apprentice might be capable of, even an unwilling \none. \nEnd recording. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 126 – Sculptor’s Tool \n10 \n \n[Tape clicks off. Tape clicks on. Martin types at a computer accompanied by \nthe occasional soft sigh.] \nMARTIN \nOh, hello. Haven’t seen you in a while. \n[Continues working] \nReally? I mean, it’s just admin. It’s not exactly thrilling listening. \n… \nRight, fine, whatever. You do you. Spool away, I guess. Just, you know, let me \nknow if you need some more batteries or something. \nIt’s because he’s back, isn’t it? \n(Deep sigh) He’s back so now you’re going to be... around again. Listening in. \nHmm, you missed him, didn’t you? \n… \nYeah. Yeah, me too. \n[Static squeal] \nPETER \nWhich isn’t a great sign, if I’m being completely honest. \n(Martin inhales in shock.) \nYou talked to him? \nMARTIN \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 126 – Sculptor’s Tool \n11 \n \nI-I-I tried not to... I-I-I didn’t mean to— \nPETER \nYou talked to him. And that’s understandable, Martin, of course it is. Please \ndon’t think I’m upset. It’s just… not ideal. Shows how much work we still have \nahead of us. \nMARTIN \nIf I keep avoiding him, people will get suspicious. \nPETER \nThey’re already suspicious, Martin, that’s not the problem. I had hoped that all \nthis time apart would have given you the space you needed, but… \nMARTIN \nYou said he’d probably never wake up. \nPETER \nAnd he beat the odds. Which is good. But it does make things more \ncomplicated. It doesn’t actually change anything. \nMARTIN \nA-A simple hello isn’t going to make any difference to— \nPETER \nWe’ve been over this. The sort of power you’re going to need relies on your— \nMARTIN \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 126 – Sculptor’s Tool \n12 \n \nObedience. \nPETER \n—isolation. It needs to be you, Martin. You’re the only one who could possibly \nbalance between the two. \nMARTIN \nBut if I could just explain— \nPETER \nAnd how do you think John’s going to react to that explanation? Hmm? Do you \nthink he’ll accept it calmly? Come through with a well-considered, rational \nresponse? \nMARTIN \nThat’s not fair. \nPETER \nOr would he assume he knows better than you and do something rash? \nMARTIN \nI don’t like being manipulated. \nPETER \nThat’s fair. But I’m not wrong. \nMARTIN \nNo. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 126 – Sculptor’s Tool \n13 \n \nPETER \nMartin, this isn’t how any of us wanted it to go, but here we are. And if we \ndon’t pull this off, it’s over for everyone. John included. \nMARTIN \nYeah, you said. \nBut if things are really so urgent, then why didn’t Elias say anything? \nPETER \n(Chuckles) Because behind all his bluster, Elias is just like all the rest. He’s so \npreoccupied playing the game, he doesn’t pay attention to the big picture. He \nmanaged to convince himself that he could get his ritual off first, which would \nhave made all of this a bit moot, but that’s not really an option anymore. So it’s \ndown to us, you and me, the dynamic duo. \nMARTIN \nAnd, so, what, that means I have to trust you? \nPETER \nIt would make things a lot simpler. \nMARTIN \n(Annoyed) Yeah, well, things would also be a lot simpler if you weren’t so \ncryptic about everything! \nPETER \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 126 – Sculptor’s Tool \n14 \n \nWell, if your archives were a bit better organised, it wouldn’t have taken me \nalmost three months to find the evidence you needed. \nMARTIN \nWhat? \nPETER \nI’m just saying, that we’d all be a lot better off if your Archivists actually knew \nhow to archive. \nMARTIN \n(Sharply) Peter. \nPETER \nYes, well, unless I’m mistaken, I believe I’ve unearthed a few of Dekker’s old \nstatements. Of course, I still need to do a bit of verification, but I’m confident \nthey should provide you with all the context you need. \nMARTIN \nGood. \nPETER \nGreat. \nMARTIN \n…", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 5, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 4344}}
