Original statement given May 15th 1996. Audio recording by \nJonathan Sims, Head Archivist of the Magnus Institute, London. \nStatement begins. \nARCHIVIST (STATEMENT) \nThree years. It was three years ago when they arrived. It wasn’t much, the little \ndelivery company I’d built up, poured my heart and soul into. I don’t know why \nthey wanted it. But they did. \n“Breekon and Sons”, I’d always wanted to call it, but I was always unlucky \nwhen it came to love, so in the end I called it “Breekon and Hope”. Just my \n\nown little joke. Backfired on me plenty; everyone always asking if I had to run \nthings by “my partner”, and often I was too awkward to correct them. I \nsometimes used to disappear into the back room, pretend I was making a call \nto “Hope”. It was harmless enough, though, and the company was growing \nwell. We had opened a few new depots, and had a few dozen drivers, making \ndeliveries anywhere from Aberdeen to Penzance. Life was pretty good, to be \nhonest. \nWhen they turned up at my office, I remember it was their shadows that I saw \nfirst. It was early evening, and the sun wasn’t shining in through the window, \nbut still their shadows fell across my desk, thick and dark as they loomed over \nme in the half-light. They wore featureless grey overalls, and even now I’m not \nsure I could easily describe what they look like, other than to say they seemed \nsolid. Somehow heavier than the world around them. They stared down at me, \ndark eyes sizing me up as I coughed gently, and asked if I could help them. \nThey traded a few words between them in another language, I think it was \nRussian, before turning back to look at me. At this point I was pretty sure these \nguys must be Mafia, probably trying to shake me down, so I waited until it was \nclear what they wanted from me. But the silence just stretched on and on and \non, and eventually I cracked; held out my hand: “Arthur Breekon at your \nservice. Who might you be?” \nThere was another pause, shorter this time, before the slightly taller of the two \n– at least, I think one was taller – turned to his companion and opened his \nmouth. “Breekon at your service. Who might you be?” Instead of the Russian \naccent I had expected, he spoke in a broad, cartoonish Cockney that I assumed \nmust be a mocking impression of my own voice. I began to stand up, to \n\ntell these jokers to get out of my office, but as I did, the shorter one turned to \nhis companion, and in a similar voice replied, “The name’s Hope. What can I do \nfor ya?” \nI don’t know why this shook me so much, but it stopped me right in my tracks. \nI just watched as they repeated these two phrases back and forth between \nthemselves, introductions made over and over again. Finally they stopped, and \nturned back to me. I had no idea what was going to happen or what I was \nmeant to do, but there was something profoundly unnatural about these two \nfigures, and I had no intention of pushing too far and finding out what it was. \nIt was a sunny day in June, and the window was open to a bright field behind \nthe building. I didn’t notice the butterfly until it had landed on the one who \nkept calling himself ‘Hope’. With a slow, languid motion he picked it up. He \nlooked at it for a couple of seconds, then looked at me. \nThen he ate the butterfly. Not slowly, or particularly fast. He just placed it \ncarefully in his mouth and began to chew. \nAs his partner did this, the one who seemed to have taken my name held out \nhis hand to me. \n“Keys,” he said, this time the word still lightly accented with Russian. I gave \nthem to him. I took the keys to the oldest of the vans, and just handed them \nover. Anything to get them out of my office. I’m not a small man, you \nunderstand, and I’m not used to feeling intimidated. I got into plenty of \nscrapes when I was young, and there was a small part of me screaming to \nteach these disrespectful punks a lesson. But when this other Breekon took the \nkey from me, what I felt beneath the skin of his hand convinced me I had made \nthe right choice. Then they turned and left.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 0, "chunk_count": 5, "chars": 4404}}
