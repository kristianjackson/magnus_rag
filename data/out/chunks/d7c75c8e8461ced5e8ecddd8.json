I was drinking a glass \nof orange juice at the time and absent-mindedly placed it on top of the lid, not \nreally realising exactly what I had done. At least not until I heard movement \nfrom underneath it. I froze, listening intently and staring, willing myself to have \nbeen imagining things. But then it came again – a soft but insistent scratching, \njust below where I had placed my glass. It was slow and deliberate and caused \ngently ripples to spread across the surface of my juice. Needless to say I was \nterrified. More than that, I was confused. The coffin had been lying in my living \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG002 – Do Not Open \n8 \n \nroom, chained and unmoving, for well over a week at this point. If there had \nbeen anything living in there when it was delivered, it seemed unlikely it would \nstill be alive. And why hadn’t it made any sound before if there was something \nin there capable of movement? I gently picked up my glass and immediately \nthe scratching stopped. I waited for some time, considering my options, before \nI placed it back down on the other end of the lid. It took about four seconds for \nthe scratching to start up again, now more insistently. When I took the glass \naway this time, it didn’t stop for another five minutes. I decided against doing \nany further experiments, and instead made the very deliberate decision to \nignore it. I felt at that point I either needed to use the heavy iron key to open it \nand see for myself what was in there, or follow the gouged instruction and \nresolve myself to never look inside. Some might call me a coward, but I \ndecided on the latter, that I would interact with it as little as possible while it \nlived in my house. Well, I guess lived may be the wrong term. I knew I’d made \nthe right decision the next time it rained, and I heard the box begin to moan. It \nwas a Saturday, and I was spending the day staying in and doing some light \nreading. I had few friends in Bournemouth, something about having a \nmysterious coffin lying in my living room made me reluctant to make the sort \nof connections that might lead to people coming round, and so I spent most of \nmy free time alone. I didn’t watch a lot of television even before my living \nroom was taken over with storing this thing, and so I now found myself sat in \nmy room reading quite a lot. I remember I had just started Michael Crichton’s \nThe Lost World at the time, and it started raining outside. It was a hard, heavy \nrain, the sort that falls straight down with no wind to disturb it, until \neverything is dark and wet. It was barely past midday, but I remember the sky \nwas so overcast and gloomy that I had to get up to turn on the light. And that \nwas when I heard it. It was a low, gentle sound.
