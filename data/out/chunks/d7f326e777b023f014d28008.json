He and Melanie’s dialogue often \noverlaps.) \nBRIAN \nOh, um, it’s, it’s, it’s… it’s Fin- Finlinson. \nMELANIE \nAh, right, sorry. That’s the… the handwriting here. So. Statement regarding… \nBRIAN \n\nSp-Spiders. B-B-But, I mean, lot, a lot of spiders! \nMELANIE \nAh. Good. A spider one. \nBRIAN \nWhat? \nMELANIE \nDate: May 26th. And, er, go on… ah, let’s, let’s get this over with. \nBRIAN \n(Confused) Is… Look, is everything okay? \nMELANIE \n \n(Sighs) Yes. Yes, it’s, it’s fine. Sorry, I just, I just don’t hold out a lot of hope \nfor… coherence. \nBRIAN \nWhat? \nMELANIE \nOur Archivist is on leave. \nBRIAN \nI don’t really. Look. I don’t really like staying in one place too long. \n\nMELANIE \nFine. Statement begins. \nBRIAN \nOh, um, I… \nMELANIE \nThat means get started. \nBRIAN \nOh, um, so… The spiders, they’re just, they’re all over my flat. Hundreds of \nspiders, and it’s freaky, like they just don’t act like spiders. And they’re leaving, \nlike, web all over, all over my stuff, like on the sofa, and on like, on like, the \nmicrowave. Like, that’s weird, right? It’s not how spiders normally are. \nMELANIE \n(Interjecting) So… let’s, let’s, let’s, er, take this from a bit earlier. When did this \nstart? When was the first “weird” spider? \nBRIAN \nA couple months? Nah, maybe a bit longer. Like, it, it started gradually, I guess. \nLike, y’know, I don’t like spiders, and sometimes, sure, there’s one in the \nbathroom, a little web or something, but that’s normal. And I just, y’know, \nasked a friend to deal with it or something. And, and then… Suddenly there \nwere more spiders! Like the corner of every room. And it’s freaky ‘cause \nthere’s, like, different types of spider. And different… \n\nMELANIE \nRight. \n(As Brian speaks, Melanie interjects with sounds of agreement.) \nBRIAN \nAnd they don’t normally, like, gather in groups of different species. It’s \ndifferent species of spider, isn’t it? \nMELANIE \n(Stuttering somewhat) I-I-I-I’m not familiar… \nBRIAN \nI feel like they’re watching me! \nMELANIE \nWhat do you mean? Are they looking… at you? \nBRIAN \nThey, they, they sort of move when I move. And, like, when I, when I go into a \ndifferent room, I feel like there’s a, there’s a flow of spiders to the same room, \nor— But they don’t me touch them, or, or, if I try and whack ‘em with a \nnewspaper, they don’t let me get near! \nMELANIE \nRight. \nBRIAN \n\nAnd then… and the weirdest thing was when I asked an exterminator to come \nand look at the problem. They all disappeared! It’s like the first time I’d been, \nthere’d been no spiders in weeks. And then suddenly, as soon as he leaves, \nthey all come back! It’s like suddenly they’re there again! \nMELANIE \n(Trying to interrupt) Was… was… was that maybe the first time there had been \nanother… person… looking at, at your flat? \nBRIAN \nUm. Well, I mean, I guess so? But no, ‘cause like— \nMELANIE \nTrying to pick this apart… \nBRIAN \n—I haven’t, haven’t invited someone to come over ‘cause there’s spiders and \nwebs everywhere. But like— but there’s— I mean— \nMELANIE \nAnd the webbing…? \nBRIAN \n—Just think it’s the other day, they webbed, they webbed my bedroom door \nshut. I mean, that’s weird, right? Like, enough spiders leave enough web to \nseal the door. And they trapped me in there with the, all those spiders. That’s \nnot normal, right?! That’s freaky! That’s supernatural! \n\nMELANIE \nBut— \nBRIAN \nThat’s what you guys do, isn’t it? \nMELANIE \nIt does sound unusual… \nBRIAN \nLike, the supernatural, right? \nMELANIE \nUm… I mean, we’re, we’re an investigative… unit, but we’re… \nBRIAN \nI just wanted some help! Like, I heard you guys like… I thought if you know \nabout the supernatural, maybe you could help me deal with this! \nMELANIE \nI… really wish that was the case. \nBRIAN \n(Distressed) Oh god! \n[Tape clicks off. Tape clicks on.] \nLYNNE \n\nYeah, and then… she… er, reached out to me. \nMARTIN \nOh, okay. Okay, right, so she reached out, um, and then… what, what \nhappened? She reached out to you, so what did you do? \nLYNNE \nEr… Well, not a lot. \nMARTIN \nRight. Um, and, and then she just… disappeared like normal? \nLYNNE \nI mean… she burned me a bit. \nMARTIN \nOh! Oh wow! Okay, er, like, are you okay? Did you— \nLYNNE \nOh. \nMARTIN \nWas there, was there a lot of damage? Are you— Is there…? \nLYNNE \nNo, no, no. It’s… er, just, just a few hairs. My right arm.
