It \nall hit me at once, like the tunnel was pushing the tidal wave of sound out just \nfor me. The shape was perfect for a terrible screaming oven. From behind me, I \nheard the shouts of Kelly and Vihaan, though I don’t know if it was because \nthey saw it too, or because they saw me fall to my knees in horror. I could hear \nthe tannoy again, now clearly speaking: “Will Inspector Sands please report. \nWill Inspector Sands please report.” Over and over again. \n \nHe smiles, and the tiny room gets hotter. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG107 – Third Degree \n \n8 \n \n \nWho is Inspector Sands? It’s a code, one of the codes we use to alert staff to \nsituations of disaster or... fire. It usually means there’s a fire. It’s to keep \npeople calm. It’s meant to not cause any panic, keep them safe even if there’s \nan emergency. \n \nHe laughs, and I wish I could go home. \n \nHow many people were on the train? I don’t know. \n \nWhat sort of train carriage was it? I don’t know. \n \nWhere did it come from? I don’t know. \n \nDid you scream? Yes. At least, I think so. The back of my throat was dry and hot \nand painful, so my mouth must have been open. I think I was screaming. \n \nWhat were your colleagues doing? Vihaan was gripping me by the shoulders, \nshaking me, yelling at me to wake up. But I was awake, I was wide awake, and I \nthink in some ways he was talking to himself. Kelly was walking past me, trying \nto battle through the choking, rancid smoke. I hope she was planning to try \nand rescue those trapped in the wreckage, but maybe she was simply trying to \njoin them. I couldn’t do anything to help either of them, and I knew that if I \ntouched them, I would burn them. \n \nHe inhales, as if in triumph. \n \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG107 – Third Degree \n \n9 \n \nAnd where are they now? They’re dead. At least that’s what I was told when \nthe officers brought me here. They found no wreckage, nothing in the tunnels, \nno corpses wailing through an underground inferno, just the dead and burnt \nbodies of Kelly Dwyer and Vihaan Prasad. \n \nWhat do you love most in the world? The question sends a shock through my \nwhole body. I know this is what he wants, all he truly cares about. I want to lie, \nto say that I love nothing and nobody, that I am alone in the world and he’ll \nhave to look elsewhere. My tongue burns in my mouth as I try to keep it still. \n \nWhat do you love most in the world? My father. I love my father more than \nanything. \n \nWho am I? I don’t answer, and he lets me leave. \n \nMy father is dead a week later. A heart attack. At the age of 63, everyone is \nsurprised and saddened, but not shocked. I try to tell myself it’s a coincidence, \nthat a heart attack is the most natural death in the world, but at the funeral, \ndespite arranging it myself, despite selecting the burial plot and the headstone, \nI watch as they take my father off for cremation. And nobody can tell me why. \nThey simply say how sorry they are for my loss and hand me my father’s ashes. \nI don’t want his ashes. \n \nI know he’ll be back, the policeman with three bright pips on his shoulder, and \nhe’ll ask me what else I love. And I’ll tell him. Then he’ll ask me who he is, and I \nwon’t say. I don’t want to cause any panic.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 3, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 3407}}
