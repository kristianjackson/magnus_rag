Now? \nARCHIVIST \nI’ll try to be quick. \nBASIRA \nWhat’s going on? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 177 – Wonderland \n19 \nMARTIN \nIt’s, it... he needs to make a statement. \nBASIRA \nIs that like a euphemism or…? \nMARTIN \nEw, no! It’s... um, he sort of describes the place he’s in to the recorder and… \nLook it’s, it’s magic Eye stuff. He can’t help it. He needs to do it and if he \ndoesn’t… \nBASIRA \nHe gets constipated? \nARCHIVIST \nHardly! \nMARTIN \nActually, yeah, basically. \nBASIRA \nRight. \nARCHIVIST \n(Annoyed) Look if you can both just give me some space, I’d appreciate it. \nMARTIN \nFine. I’ll keep lookout. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 177 – Wonderland \n20 \n[Martin moves away] \nBASIRA \nNo. If it’s information about this domain, I think I’d better hear it. \nARCHIVIST \n(Sighingly) If you say so... \n[Hissing static starts] \n[The hospital sounds subtly change; a room door opens and \nfootsteps approach then stop; a nearby reception phone becomes \nmuffled as the door closes] \n[A clock ticks quietly] \n[Hissing static ends] \nARCHIVIST \nHi. How are we doing? You can call me Doctor David. I’ll be here to help you \nout for the duration of your stay with us. \n[Pen click] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nDo you have a name? \n[Paper noises] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nHm. Hm. Well, I’m afraid I’ll have to disagree with you there. That’s not your \nname at all. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 177 – Wonderland \n21 \n[Creak and fabric movements from a bed] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nNow don’t get agitated, I’m sure we’ll get there. Names are… tricky. You know \nhow long it took me to realise I was Doctor David? I mean, neither do I, to be \nperfectly honest, but the point is names can take a while. And we’ll be here to \nsupport you every step of the way. \n[Creak and fabric movements from a bed] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nHm? Oh, didn’t they tell you when you were signed in? Not to worry, these \nthings slip my mind as well sometimes. You’re in Wonderland House. We’re a \nsmall residential mental health facility here to help people like you come to \ntheir senses. And to protect the world from all your self-indulgent nonsense in \nthe meantime. \n[Creak and fabric movements from a bed] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nI can, I assure you. I’m your doctor. Doctor David. I’m here to help you, to treat \nyou, to make it so you’re less of a… burden to everyone. And until I’m satisfied \nthat we’ve reached that point, well, there’s plenty here to keep you \ncomfortable. Because obviously, it wouldn’t be responsible of us to let you out \ninto general society. Not in your current state. \n[Short creak and fabric movements from a bed] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 177 – Wonderland \n22 \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nHm? No, of course it’s not just them. We’re here to help you. You’re the \nbiggest victim of... whatever little game you’re playing here. And we know just \nhow to help you. \n[Creak and fabric movements from a bed] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nPlease do try not to get so agitated. I understand, it’s a distressing time, but \nthere’s really nothing to be gained from... acting out. \n[Creak and fabric movements from a bed] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nThere are no windows to escape through, all the— \n[Wood furniture movement] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nYes, as I was saying, all the furniture is very firmly bolted down, and honestly \nyou’re only going to hurt yoursel— \n[A clipboard and pen hits the ground] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nHm. I see. Violence, then, is it? Oh, I assure you there is no way to hurt me. \nNothing you could say or do could cause me even a moment’s inconvenience. \nYour anger is… pointless.
