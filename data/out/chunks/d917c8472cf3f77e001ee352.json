Hmmm. \n[Wood creaks as the building rearranges herself] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 187 – Checking Out \n \n24 \nHELEN (CONT’D) \nBest not. \n(Crying from the Guest, then a last exhalation) \n[A door slams; both manifested Helen and the Guest have gone] \n[The high-pitched tone ends] \nARCHIVIST \nSending her away? I must have hit a nerve. \n[Helen’s voice returns to being part of the building] \nHELEN \nGot on my nerves. Not the same thing. \nARCHIVIST \nIf you say so. \n(Beat) \nHELEN \nSo, what happens now? \nARCHIVIST \nYou mean, did the sight of a poor, innocent wretch suffering by your hand \nconvince me that you need to be destroyed? \nHELEN \nPretty much. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 187 – Checking Out \n \n25 \nARCHIVIST \nNo. \nYou were right — it probably was something that would have convinced \nMartin it needed to be done. \nHELEN \nBut..? \nARCHIVIST \nBut I already knew what I would see in here. I already knew what I had to do. \nHELEN \nBecause you’ve grown so fond of your old pal Helen. Or because… you were \nalready going to destroy me. \n…I see. \nARCHIVIST \nI was hoping I was wrong about you. \nHELEN \nYou’ve always known what I am. \nARCHIVIST \nYes. But I’m only recently realising just how dangerous you are. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 187 – Checking Out \n \n26 \nHELEN \nOf course I’m dangerous, John. I’m a monster, just like you. and you can’t kill \nall of us. \nARCHIVIST \nNo. You’re dangerous because for all the torture and cruelty, you still \nsomehow got us to think you’re our friend. \nHELEN \nI am your friend. \nARCHIVIST \nNo. You’re not. That’s just what you distort. It’s why you spin but you never \nquite lie. The corridors, the warped body, it’s all just set dressing, isn’t it? It’s \nnot the reality of what you actually are. \nHELEN \nAnd what, actually, am I? \nARCHIVIST \nYou’re a question. \nHELEN \nWhat lurks behind the door? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 187 – Checking Out \n \n27 \nARCHIVIST \nTo some. But that would be The Stranger or The Dark — no, you are the \nquestion of what lurks behind a smile? Is a friendship true, or is it reaching out \nwith hands that cut you? \nHELEN \nOh I see, very good. \nARCHIVIST \nEven I didn’t see it properly, not at first. Not until the tunnels, when you \nwouldn’t help. When you laughed. \nHELEN \nOh, come on. That wasn’t a deception, that was barely a betrayal! \nARCHIVIST \nYou worked to hurt us and help us, all with the same smile, until we can barely \ntell one from the other. Keeping us off-balance, constantly second-guessing \nour own opinions of you. Never quite crossing a line we could never forgive, \nbut never putting yourself on the line either. And when one face finally \nstopped smiling, you just changed the face. \nHELEN \nFine. So if that’s all true… why? Why would I do any of that? What’s my actual \nmotive? \nARCHIVIST \nI don’t think you even have one. It’s just what you are. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 187 – Checking Out \n \n28 \nHELEN \nOh well done. Very poetic. \nARCHIVIST \nBut none of that actually matters. What matters is that you want the world to \nstay as it is. And I don’t know if we can change it back, but if there is any \npossibility, you will try and stop us. And when you do, I can’t think of anyone \nmore dangerous. \nHELEN \nOh give over! You’re the most powerful thing in the world. (Placatingly) What \ncould I possibly do? \nARCHIVIST \nIt’s not me I’m worried about. \n[Hissing static starts] \nHELEN \nEurgh, fine. I thought this might happen. \n[Static builds, alongside unpleasant electronic high tones and \nglitching — the ‘smite static’ from the Not-Sasha encounter] \nARCHIVIST \nCeaseless Watch—aargh! \n[Creaking as the corridors flex and constrict and doors slam \nand echo] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 187 – Checking Out \n \n29 \n[The Archivist is unbalanced] \nHELEN \nWant to try that again? \nARCHIVIST \nCeasel— \n[The smite statics waver as Helen flexes] \nHELEN \n(Darkly) You are inside my domain now, Archivist. \n(Unbalanced noise from Archivist) \nI can shift any part of myself to any corner of this wonderful hell you have built \nfor us. By the time the Eye focuses on me I’m already somewhere new— \n[A door creaks open with multiple echoes] \nHELEN (CONT’D) \n—something new. \nARCHIVIST \nCeaseless— ooh— \n[Another shift in the building happens; the smite statics are still \nstruggling to rise] \nHELEN \nWhoopsie!", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 5, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 4340}}
