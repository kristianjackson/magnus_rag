It had a high gate separating it from \nthe main road, which has the name “Moorland House” carved into the stone of \nthe gatepost. I drove there alone, my old, second-hand Vauxhall Astra \ncomplaining all the way. You remember that storm that hit at the end of last \nMarch? Well, I hardly noticed it. Thinking back, I really shouldn’t have been \ndriving at all, but at the time it barely registered. The trees were bending \nominously when I finally parked at Moorland House, and I immediately lost the \nonly respectful hat that I owned to the wind. Evan had once told me that his \nfamily had a lot of money, and looking at this place I realised why the funeral \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG013 – Alone \n8 \n \nwas being held there. I could see round the side what appeared to be a well-\nkept mausoleum. The last resting place of Evan’s ancestors, and soon, I \nguessed, of Evan himself. This thought set me crying again, and it was in that \nstate, weeping, windswept and soaked through from the rain, that I saw the \ndoor open. \nI don’t know what I expected from Evan’s father. I knew he couldn’t be \nanything like the easy, charming man I’d fallen in love with, but the hard-faced \nstranger that confronted me on the doorstep still came as a shock. It was like \nlooking at Evan, but as if age had drained all the joy and affection from him. I \nstarted to introduce myself, but he just shook his head and pointed inside, to a \ndoor down the corridor behind him, and spoke the only words he ever said to \nme. He said, “My son is in there. He is dead.” And then he turned and walked \naway, leaving me shaken, with no option but to follow him inside. \nThe house was full of people I didn’t know. None of the lovely, welcoming \nfaces I’d come to know from Evan’s friends could be seen among the dour \nfigures of his family. Each wore the same hard expression as his father, and I \nmight have been imagining it, but I could have sworn that when they looked at \nme, their eyes were full of something dark. Anger, maybe? Blame? God knows \nI felt guilty enough about his death, though I have no idea why. None of them \nspoke to me or to each other, and the house was so quiet and still that at times \nit seemed like I could hardly breathe under the weight of the silence. \nFinally, I came to the room where he was laid out. Evan, the man I was going to \nmarry, was lying there in a shining oak casket that seemed too big for him, \nsomehow. The coffin was open, and I could see him, dressed in a perfectly \ntailored black suit. I realised I had never seen him wear a suit before. Like \neverything else in his death, it seemed utterly alien to the life that had he had \ncreated for himself. I remember going to my father’s funeral when I was very \nyoung. I remember seeing him lying there, after the undertakers had done \ntheir business. My father had looked serene, peaceful, like he had calmly \naccepted the reality of his passing. It had comforted me, as a child, though it \nhad done little to blunt the acute sense of loss I felt. There was none of that on \nEvan’s face. In death he seemed to have that same hardness and reproach that \nI saw on every one of the silent family that claimed him for their own.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 3, "chunk_count": 9, "chars": 3234}}
