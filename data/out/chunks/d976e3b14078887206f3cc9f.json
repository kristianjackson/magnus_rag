He was quiet for a few seconds, and then asked \nme if I could send him a photo of the pot. His tone was different, and he \nsounded oddly wary when he made the request. I was very on edge by this \npoint, but could come up with no good reason not to agree, so I took a few \npictures with my phone and sent them through to him. \nIt was a long time before he spoke again, and when he did he sounded... \ndifferent. Almost scared, I thought. He told me that I could keep it. No charge. I \nbegan to protest again, but he ignored it. I remember his exact words: “I do \nnot remember having that thing, which means it belongs to you.” Then he \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG038 – Lost and Found \n6 \n \nhung up. This was all very strange, of course, but even then I wasn’t worried. \nNot like I should have been. \nIt was my book next. A signed copy of Catch-22, my favourite book. Vanished \nfrom its place on my bookshelf, leaving only an empty space behind. David just \ngave me another blank stare when I asked him about it. I admit I almost lost it \nat him then. Shoes were one thing, but that book meant a lot to me. I accused \nhim of playing some stupid joke, and tried to remind him what I’d gone \nthrough to get it, flying over to America for Joseph Heller’s last book tour, \nqueuing for hours and then that dreadful evening I thought that sudden \nrainstorm had ruined it all. By the end he was looking… very alarmed indeed \nand started to ask me how I was feeling. He wanted to know if I’d been under a \nlot of stress at work, if there was anything I wanted to talk about. I left. \nMaybe he was right. Maybe I am crazy. It makes a lot more sense, doesn’t it? It \nwould make it neat. Except no. No, I would need to have gone mad a long, long \ntime before this for the idea of it being in my head to hold up. My perceptions \nare the only ones I can trust. Maybe. I don’t know. This went on for months. \nThe tie I got for my last birthday, my grandfather’s teapot, the tunic I bought \nfrom Salesa, things just kept going missing, and every time David would tell me \nthat whatever it was didn’t exist. Or it wasn’t mine. Or I was misremembering. \nFor a while I thought he was actually trying to gaslight me, make me think I was \nlosing my mind, but when the tunic went missing I called Salesa again. This \ntime he laughed when he told me that he didn’t remember selling any World \nWar I items to me on my visit. I checked the invoice, and it was no longer listed \nthere. Just empty, accusing paper where the words had been. I know these \nthings were real. I know they existed. Why won’t anyone just believe me? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG038 – Lost and Found \n7 \n \nThis is where I started to come undone a bit. To be honest I don’t think anyone \nwould do much better in my situation. I hadn’t made any connection between \nthe old Chinese pot and the disappearances. I mean, why would I? But I also \nhadn’t been able to sell it. Whenever I tried, something would get in the way. \nThe other person would forget to send through a crucial email, or they’d stop \nresponding. Once I managed to get it as far as posting it out to a buyer, but it \nwas returned immediately with a note asking why it had been sent to her. \nGradually, I began to get suspicious of the thing. Sitting there, with its \ncascading, maddening patterns in that vile cobalt blue. Trying to tell me that I \nthings didn’t exist, that they hadn’t vanished when I know they have. \nI took to watching it. I wasn’t getting much sleep and David was worried sick \nabout me. I know he was talking to various doctors about getting me help. \nThere were certainly a couple of points I was worried about him having me \nsectioned. None of it helps in the end. It was about a month ago. I had placed \nthe vase in the centre of the table, and was sat staring at it. Keeping an eye on \nit. Checking for… god knows what. This had been my ritual for the previous \nweek, keeping my vigil into the small hours, but that night... that night I fell \nasleep in front of it. I don’t remember my dream. Running, maybe? I know I \nwoke with a start sometime around 2 in the morning \nAs I tried to rub the sleep from my eyes, I heard a sound from the table in front \nof me. It was the dull thump of a heavy book hitting the tabletop. I looked and, \nsure enough, there was my copy of Catch-22, just lying there in front of that \nstrange ceramic thing. And not just my book, there was a small pile of objects \nar", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 3, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 4500}}
