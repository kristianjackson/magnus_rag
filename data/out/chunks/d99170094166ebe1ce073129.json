It surprised me \nhow intact she seemed, until I saw the flames creeping up from the hatch. \nIt was then that the ringing in my ears faded enough for me to hear it: the \nscreaming from inside the tank. Dickie was still in there. I looked at my \ncompanions and saw in their faces that they heard it too. There was nothing \nthey could have done to save the poor fool, of course. If they had trapped him \nin there, then getting to him would have been impossible and trying would \nonly have got them killed. So I had to lie there and listen to Dickie roast to \ndeath. I don’t know how long it took, but it felt like hours. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 053 - Crusader \n7 \n \nAt some point there must have been a retreat ordered, as I saw the rest of the \nCrusaders pulling back. Frank managed to catch the attention of one of them \nand the commander agreed to take me back somewhere the medics could get \na look at my leg, although there wasn’t room for us all. So they literally \nstrapped me to the top of the tank and we drove off, leaving Ralph and Frank \nto make their own way back. It wasn’t until I tracked Ralph down almost ten \nyears later that I found they had been captured soon afterwards and had spent \nthe rest of the war in an Italian POW camp. Oh, the way they described it, they \nhad been quite comfortable, but as far as I knew at the time, we were leaving \nthem to their death. If I hadn’t been so delirious with heat and pain, I might \nhave cried. \nMy memory of the trip back is fragmented and I have only faint impressions of \nthe pain which every vibration of the tank’s engines sent through my injured \nleg, as I passed in and out of consciousness. Then there was stillness, \nshouting... I remember a faint prick in my arm and, and, and then a different \nsort of haze settled over my mind as numbness and sleep spread through my \nveins. \nThe next thing I recall with any clarity is my hospital bed. I’d been taken over \nthe border back to Egypt and had ended up in the British military hospital in \nAlexandria. When I awoke it, it was so quiet that, for a minute, I had the \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 053 - Crusader \n8 \n \nsudden panicked thought that I might be deaf. But it was just that after so \nmany days hearing the roar of one engine or another, th-the peace of an \nalmost empty hospital was so deep and serene that I couldn’t understand it. \nWhen she came round, the nurse was kind enough to inform me that I was one \nof the first wounded to have returned from Bir el Gubi, but they were \nexpecting more. \nSure enough, over the next few days, the ward filled up and my peace slipped \naway beneath the steady stream of injured soldiers. I didn’t mind too much, as \nit was still a damn sight better than rolling over the boiling desert in an iron \ncoffin, not to mention the fact that it turned out I wasn’t going to lose the leg, \nwhich is the sort of news to put you in a very good mood. The doctors told me \nI’d probably always have a limp, as I’m sure you’ve noticed, but it wasn’t \ninfected and there wasn’t the nerve damage they’d been afraid of. So, all told, \nit was a pretty good wound to get. \nAfter a few weeks, I was walking on without too much pain and the nurses \nadvised me to start taking the occasional walk around Alexandria. I did so, but \nbetween the locals and the army, it was a crowded, noisy place, even at night. I \ntook to taking my walks further and further from the hospital and the city \ncentre, and occasionally I’d find myself wandering some way beyond the city \nlimits, at least as far as my leg would allow.
