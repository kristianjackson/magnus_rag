He even showed me the \nstill he kept out back once, and I’m very thankful I was on duty at the time, or I \nmight have had to drink some out of politeness. \nSo, I’m driving, heading towards this break-in over in Dalnessie, when \nConstable Carla Ross, my partner, starts telling me to slow down. Now, Ross \nhad known Callum a lot longer than I had, being about ten years my senior on \nthe force, and had a good twenty years’ experience policing these \ncommunities. I dropped speed, and she stared out at one of the crofts next to \nus, making this little noise of uncertainty. I was just about to speed up again \nwhen she gasped and yelled to stop the car. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 125 – Civilian Casualties \n \n3 \n \nThere wasn’t really anywhere to park, but the road was wide enough to pass \non, and barely saw two cars in an hour, so I just stopped where we were and \ngot out. Staring out over the low stone wall, I could see a figure stood in the \nmiddle of the field. It took me a moment to recognise Callum McKenzie, \nholding out his pitchfork as he looked over his croft. But no, the angle was \nwrong. He wasn’t holding his pitchfork, he was just gripping the handle, and I \nrealised with a jolt that the sharp tines were buried in his stomach. From this \nangle, I could just about make out the ends of them protruding from his back, \nand suddenly everything seemed very still. \nRoss acted before I did. She vaulted over the wall and started running towards \nCallum, calling his name, and I followed a second after her. But then he turned, \nand we both stopped short. I can’t exactly say what it was in his turn that so \nunsettled me. Maybe it was too violent, too smooth; it seemed like the \npitchfork should have flown out of him, but it stayed wedged in place. Maybe \nit was something in his eyes, or that smile of his. Or maybe just the sheer \namount of blood on him that didn’t seem right for the neat punctures that \nwe’d seen. \nThen he turned and began to run towards us at a dead sprint, pushing the \nhandle that protruded from his torso towards us like a battering ram. I called \nat him to stay still, to wait there while we got help, but he just kept coming. \nThen Ross told him to stop, and I could hear in her voice that she was afraid of \nhim. I was too. As he got closer, I saw him let go of the bloody pitchfork and \ndrop his hands to his sides like claws. Broken glass was pressed into his fingers, \nglinting red in the morning sun, and I knew with absolute certainty that he \nintended to kill us. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 125 – Civilian Casualties \n \n4 \n \nThe moment before he reached us, I grabbed the handle that still stuck from \nhis belly. It was pure instinct, and my hands exploded in sharp pains as \nsplinters from the rough wooden handle dug into my fingers and palm, but \nCallum McKenzie stopped dead with a horrible lurch, as the metal prongs \nburied themselves still deeper. Ross stood there, baton in hand, clearly \ndesperate not to use it, as Callum swung his glass-covered arms at me, trying \nto slash at my face, and coming within an inch or two of doing so, only kept at \nbay by the distance of the pitchfork’s handle. I finally got a look at his eyes, \nexpecting to see mania or a glassy stare, but when they met mine, they were \nclear and focused. His smile got wider. \n“Bastard English,” he snarled and paused a moment, assessing the situation. \nWith a grunt of effort, he pushed himself further onto the tines of the fork, \nmoving slowly, agonisingly up them, desperately trying to make it those last \nfew inches to reach my throat. \nThen there was the sound of something… tearing, and I think he must have \nruptured something, because his legs went out from under him, and where \nblood had been oozing before, it now began to gush. He choked as it started to \nfill his throat, and I tried, I really tried, to reach out and help him, but he still \nslashed at me with those mutilated hands, and I couldn’t get close enough. \nThen it was quiet. Ross still stood there, baton raised in exactly same position, \nseemingly frozen in confusion and disgust. She looked at me, as if I might have \nany explanation, but what the hell was I supposed to say? We just kept looking \nat this broken man, her friend, who had literally killed himself attacking us. I \nwent back to the car to radio for help, but it didn’t seem to be working right. \nAll I could hear from it was the faint noise of static and what sounded like \nbagpipes", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 1, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 4500}}
