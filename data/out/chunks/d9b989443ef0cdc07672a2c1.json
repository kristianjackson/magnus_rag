Again, it was an unmarked black refuse bag placed next to the recycling \nbin. As soon as I saw it, I knew it was another one. The shape of it was too \nregular to be full of the normal assortment of rubbish. As I picked it up, I \nrealised it was far too light as well. It seemed to weigh almost nothing, but was \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG005 – Thrown Away \n5 \n \nbulging with what sounded like a whole load of paper inside. I gave the others \na look and told them I thought we had another odd bag. David and Matt \nstarted discussing whether we should open it, as this one didn’t seem to have a \nrip like the last one, and we were still talking it over when Alan came back to \nsee what was taking us so long. He knew where we were and you could see it \nin his eyes that he’d been hoping this was the reason for the delay. One look at \nhis face and I knew that if we didn’t open it, he would. \nI looked up towards the house, checking for anyone watching, but 93 was right \nnear the start of our route, so it was still very early in the morning and all the \nlights were off. There was no sign of movement so, very carefully, I opened the \nbag. Inside was paper, as I expected. It seemed to be a single strip of thick \nwhite writing paper, maybe an inch wide. The paper was long, so long that it \nseemed like the whole bag was filled solely with this one piece of it, wrapped \nand curled and crumpled to fit inside. There was writing on it in another \nlanguage, I think Latin. Matt, who was raised Catholic and never shut up about \nit, said he recognised it and claimed that it was the Lord’s Prayer, the Our \nFather, written over and over again. He seemed pretty rattled about it, \nespecially at the fact that at certain points the edges of the paper seemed to \nbe slightly singed, as though it had been passed over a candle or a lighter. He \neven seemed hesitant about throwing it in with the rest of the garbage, but we \ndidn’t have anything else we could actually do with it, so into the truck it went. \nAlan was smiling the rest of the shift, and there was a delight there that, quite \nfrankly, had started to unsettle me a bit. As far as I was concerned this was a \nbit of a let down after the dolls’ heads, but the way the others had reacted put \nme on edge. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG005 – Thrown Away \n6 \n \nThe third bag was the one that really changed things. It was a fortnight after \nthe one with the prayer paper in it. As we approached 93, I noticed there was \nanother bag sitting next to the bin. The others clearly noticed as well, as \neveryone went very quiet. The first two had been the only times there had \nbeen rubbish bags at the house that weren’t in the actual bin itself, so there \nwas little doubt in my mind that this was going to be more creepy trash. Alan \nturned the engine off as we pulled level with the house, and got out. Whatever \nwas in this one, he was going to see it. The bag bulged, just like the others, but \nhad a bumpy sort of look to its surface. We all stared at it for several seconds, \nbefore I realised that the others were waiting for me to pick it up – I’d picked \nup the others, and apparently this was how it was done now. It almost felt like \na ritual. \nI walked over and lifted it off the ground. It was heavier than the last one, and \nas it moved it made a sound, like shifting sand or gravel, or maybe more of a \nrattle. I started to carry it towards my colleagues to open it, when I accidentally \ncaught the bottom of it on the low brick wall at the end of the small front \ngarden. Already filled almost to bursting, the bag tore open easily. \nFrom the newly ripped hole, poured teeth. Hundreds, thousands of teeth; they \ncame streaming down it a waterfall of white, cream and yellow, bouncing as \nthey hit the pavement, and gradually forming a pile of astounding size. When \nthe bag was finally empty, we just stood there in silence, staring at the \nmountain of teeth that now lay on ground before us. They looked like human \nteeth to me, but I wasn’t exactly an expert and I sure as hell didn’t want to \ncheck closer.
