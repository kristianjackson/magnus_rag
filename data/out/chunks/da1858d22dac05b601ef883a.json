Episode one hundred and twenty-\nthree. Web Development. \n[Tape clicks on.] \n(The Archivist is sighing and mumbling to himself, searching his office) \nARCHIVIST \nRight, where did the— “A coma? Great! Let’s rearrange his office! Sleeping \npeople don’t need pens.” \n[Brief sound of something squelching.] \nUrgh. Urgh, what…? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 123 - Web Development \n2 \n \n[Sounds of movement outside. Door opens] \n[The Archivist & Melanie’s subsequent conversation takes place in the \ncorridor and is somewhat distant to the recorder] \nARCHIVIST \nMelanie! It’d be good to, uh… Melanie? Are you al— \n[Something ceramic crashes and smashes] \nWoah! Woah! \nMELANIE \n(Snarling) Get away from me! \nARCHIVIST \nMelanie, it’s, it’s me. \nMELANIE \nNo, no, no. \nARCHIVIST \nLook. No, I-I-I-I-I’m back. \nMELANIE \nOh, oh, yeah? Back to your happy little family! \nARCHIVIST \nWhat? No, I, I didn’t mean— \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 123 - Web Development \n3 \n \nMELANIE \nHow’d you make it out, then, hm? \nARCHIVIST \nWhat? \nMELANIE \nTim is dead! Daisy is dead! And you? What, you’re just fine?! \nARCHIVIST \nWha— No, I’ve been in hospital for six months! \nMELANIE \nSomething has been in hospital. Something that’s got your face. I, I warned \nBasira! I said not to let you back in here, but she just doesn’t listen! \nARCHIVIST \n(Calming) Melanie, Melanie… it’s me. \nMELANIE \nOh, okay. So what? Hi John, how are you? Get anyone killed lately? \nARCHIVIST \nI… I… \nMELANIE \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 123 - Web Development \n4 \n \n(Aggrieved) Wipe that look off your face. Like you’re not the reason all of this \nis happening. Like you’re any better than, than him. \nARCHIVIST \n(The Archivist burbles for a few moments) But Basira said Elias was gone. \nMELANIE \nOh, gone? Right, yes, yes. He’s… he’s ‘gone’. Like that makes any difference. \nARCHIVIST \nI don’t understand. \nMELANIE \nNo, you don’t, do you? He’s still alive. You are still alive! So this place is still… \n(Inarticulate sounds of Melanie’s rage) \nARCHIVIST \nMelanie! Melanie, this isn’t you. \nMELANIE \n(Snarled) Back! Off! \n[Fist connects solidly] \nYou don’t know me! And I don’t know you. So stay the hell away from me or I \nswear I’ll— \nARCHIVIST \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 123 - Web Development \n5 \n \nOkay… okay. \n[Melanie leaves] \nI-I’m sorry. \n[Tape clicks off. Tape clicks on] \nARCHIVIST \nShe nearly attacked me, Basira! I mean, I know me and Melanie haven’t always \nseen eye to eye before, but… Christ! \nBASIRA \nYeah, I did warn you. She’s not, uh, she’s not been having a good time. \nARCHIVIST \nMmm! Yes, I did get that impression. \n(Sighs) Elias is gone. I thought— I mean, wasn’t that supposed to be… it? But \nshe is still— \nBASIRA \nIt’s not that simple. \nARCHIVIST \nShe needs help, Basira. God, it didn’t even get that bad with… Even Tim never \nthreatened me, not like that. \nBASIRA \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 123 - Web Development \n6 \n \nRight, just back off. You haven’t been here. \nARCHIVIST \nO-okay. You’re right. I haven’t, so explain it to me. \nBASIRA \n(Long sigh) Alright. Best I can understand it, Beholding or The Eye or whatever \nyou want to call it, we’re one of the only powers that hasn’t actually taken a \nshot at a ritual. Yet. And everything out there knows it. \nARCHIVIST \nNo, I mean, we… we can’t be the only ones, surely? \nBASIRA \nI don’t know. Probably not. \nBut we made a big noise with the Unknowing, and… other stuff… and now \nthey’ve taken notice. We’re safe in here. Usually. But we don’t go out much \nanymore. \nARCHIVIST \n“Usually”? \nBASIRA \nYeah. \nARCHIVIST \nYou were attacked. When? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 123 - Web Development \n7 \n \nBASIRA \nAbout two months ago. It was, uh… It was The Flesh. \nARCHIVIST \nOh God. \nBASIRA \nYeah. It was bad. We took them all out. Melanie did most of them. She was… \nShe got a knife from somewhere and— \nARCHIVIST \nBasira, I… I don’t know if that’s a good sign. \nBASIRA \nShe saved my life, John. She saved all of us. I won’t forget that. \nARCHIVIST \nFine. Fine. \nHaven’t seen Martin about yet? \nBASIRA \nYeah, he comes and goes. He’s busy. Well, he seems it. \nARCHIVIST \nWorking for Peter Lukas. \nBASIRA", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 0, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 4406}}
