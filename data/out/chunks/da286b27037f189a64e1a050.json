Episode eighty. The Librarian. \n[The Magnus Archives Theme – Intro – Continues] \n[Tape clicks on.] \nLEITNER \nPlease! I don’t know how much time we have. \nARCHIVIST \nSo you said. \n[The clang of the metal pipe being placed on the table] \nLEITNER \nIs that necessary? You think I pose a danger to you? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG080 – The Librarian \nARCHIVIST \nYes. Yes I do. \nLEITNER \nThen take it with you, but I can’t afford to just sit here. \nARCHIVIST \nSo talk fast. \nLEITNER \nCould we at least have this conversation in the tunnels? \nARCHIVIST \nI’m not going back down there. That thing… Is it dead? \nLEITNER \nUnlikely. Whether something like that can actually be destroyed… It is trapped. \nI, I hope for a very long time. \nARCHIVIST \nAnd Sasha… The real one? \nLEITNER \nWas that her name? I’m afraid she’s gone. Whatever it does to those it takes, \nthey don’t come back. She’s dead. Do you need a moment? \nARCHIVIST \nNo. No, I’m… You’re not what I expected. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG080 – The Librarian \nLEITNER \nI suppose not. My family emigrated when I was very young. English was always \nmy first language. I used to adopt an accent sometimes when meeting people, \na sort of personal joke, but truth be told, my Norwegian is terrible. Now, are \nyou going to help me or not? \nARCHIVIST \nYou first. You want my help, you answer my questions. Agreed? \nLEITNER \nAgreed. \nARCHIVIST \nGood. Good. \nStatement of Jurgen Leitner. February 16th, 2017. Statement begins. \nLEITNER \nYou’re quite like her, you know. I suppose that’s no surprise. Anyway, your \nquestions? \nARCHIVIST \n \nRight. Let’s start with what you did down there. How you… trapped it. \n[The sound of books being placed on the table.] \nLEITNER \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG080 – The Librarian \nAn unexpurgated copy of Ruskin’s The Seven Lamps of Architecture, published \nin 1845. Of course, Ruskin didn’t even begin writing the book until 1846, and \nthe text of this one varies markedly from the version that was distributed. It \ngives an acute sense of the walls pressing in around you, and if consumed \nrecklessly, will physically entomb the reader. \nOver the years, I have found that it interacts with Smirke’s architecture, and \nthose tunnels specifically, in a more predictable way. By carefully reading \nspecific passages in certain locations, I am able to exercise… a degree of \ncontrol over the substance of the tunnels. \nARCHIVIST \nI didn’t hear you say anything down there. \nLEITNER \nI said reading. It doesn’t need to be spoken aloud. \nARCHIVIST \nRight. So you can change the tunnels? \nLEITNER \nI can. Though even setting aside the obvious dangers, it’s a time-consuming \nand imprecise process. That said, I will admit that when you began to explore \nagain, I… closed off certain passages, and remade others. I, I wanted to keep \nyou contained while deciding whether to make contact. \nARCHIVIST \nYou moved the tunnels for me?", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 0, "chunk_count": 9, "chars": 3390}}
