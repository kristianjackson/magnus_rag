I’ve put you on speaker \nBASIRA \n[Basira’s voice is coming through a speaker on a phone for this whole \nconversation] \n\nMaxwell Rayner. Have you heard of him? \nARCHIVIST \nYes. Why? \nBASIRA \nWho is he? \nARCHIVIST \nHe was a cult leader back in the Nineties. I don’t know about now. \nBASIRA \nThe Church of the People? \nARCHIVIST \nThe People’s Church of the Divine Host. \nBASIRA \nRight. \nARCHIVIST \nIs he involved in a case or something? \nBASIRA \nWe’re on our way to arrest him. (Pause) \nHello? \nARCHIVIST \nNo I’m... Yes, I’m here. You’ve found him? \n\nBASIRA \nNot me, but I’m one of the ones going in. There’s a lot of sectioned guys here, \nso I thought I’d give you a call. Any advice? \nARCHIVIST \nBring torches. \nBASIRA \nTorches? \nARCHIVIST \nAs many as you can get your hands on.

(Sigh) \nStatement of Craig Goodall, regarding his explorations of an abandoned \nchicken and kebab shop in Walthamstow. Original statement given 20th \nOctober 2009. Audio recording by Jonathan Sims, Head Archivist of the \nMagnus Institute, London. \nStatement begins. \nARCHIVIST (STATEMENT) \nI feel like I should be upfront with this right at the beginning. I’m probably a \ncannibal. I don’t know for sure, but the likelihood is high. You ever hear of Han \nYong? Otherwise known as John Haan? I guess it depends on what corners of \nthe Internet you lurk in or what tabloids you were reading in 2004. If you \nhaven’t, let me explain. John Haan ran a small takeaway on Higham Hill Road in \nWalthamstow. \nWeirdly enough, it wasn’t a Chinese; it just served kebab, chicken, burgers... \nthe usual. Well, it went out of business in May 2004 when Mr. Haan was \narrested for murdering his wife, Lanying. So far, so mundane, right? Except for \nthe fact that over the previous two weeks John Haan had been disposing of the \nbody the way only a takeaway owner can. He went full-on Sweeny Todd. \nNow, the thing is, I live just off Higham Hill Road, and I used to go to that \ntakeaway all the time. I definitely went there a few times in May 2004. I \nhaven’t been able to find out from any of the news reports exactly what he \nwas selling the meat as, but over the course of the month I definitely had \nchicken wings, doner kebab, chicken kebab and a burger, so there’s a very \ngood chance I ate some of her. It’s weird, though, everything I’ve found online \nsays that human meat is meant to be very similar to pork, but nothing I was", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 0, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 3366}}
