By \nthe time I woke up the next morning I was feeling more or less ok, though I \nkept a plaster on the cut on my forehead, and tried not to think too much \nabout the previous night. \nOne evening a few days later, though, I found myself staring out of my \nwindow, the one that faced the street, and I remembered how close Graham \nlived. I looked to see if I could figure out which window was his and, yeah, sure \nenough, there it was. It was actually a remarkably clear view of his flat, and I \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG003 – Across The Street \n7 \n \ncould see him sat on the sofa, reading one of the notebooks from his \nbookshelves. I realised that if I could see him so clearly, he could likely see me \njust as well if he chose to look up and, with some remnant of my apprehension \nfrom that Friday, I decided to turn off the light in my flat, so he wouldn’t see \nme if he looked up. And then, I went back to watching him. \nYeah, I know that sounds creepy. It really wasn’t meant to be. I said earlier that \nI really enjoy people-watching and, regardless of how boring he may have been \nto speak to, Graham was weirdly compelling to watch. So that’s just what I did. \nAnd not just that night, either. Yeah, there’s no non-sinister way to say that \nwatching Graham became my hobby. It was strange, I’ll admit it. But I just \ncouldn’t stop myself. I reasoned I wasn’t watching him with any purpose or \nmalice in mind. It was purely out a detached interest in his life. And in my \ndefence I would have stopped a lot sooner if it hadn’t been for the bizarre \nthings he would do. He would constantly reorder his journals, without any \napparent system of organisation, most of the time without even opening them. \nSometimes he would grab an apparently random notebook from the shelves \nand start scribbling in it, even though I could see that the page was already \ncovered in writing. \nOnce, and I swear this is true, I saw him take one of his notebooks and start to \ntear out the pages one at a time. And then, slowly and deliberately, he ate \nthem. It must have taken him three hours to get through the whole book, but \nhe didn’t stop or pause, he just kept going. \nEven when he wasn’t doing anything with the notebooks, there was an odd \nenergy to him. From what I could see he was constantly on edge, and jumped \nevery time any loud noise passed on the street below. A police siren, a \nbreaking bottle, hell, I even saw him freak out over an ice-cream \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG003 – Across The Street \n8 \n \ntruck once. Each time he’d leap to his feet, run to the window and start looking \nout; wildly craning his neck from side to side. Sometimes he’d look up, but I’d \nlearned his patterns well enough to avoid being spotted. Then, all at once, he’d \ndecide that there was no problem and go back to whatever he was doing \nbefore. And by “whatever he was doing before”, yeah, I mean nothing. He \napparently didn’t have a television or a computer – the only books he seemed \nto own were his own notebooks, and I only ever saw him eat takeaway food. I \ndon’t know how many times I watched him eat the same pizza – pepperoni \nwith jalapeño peppers and anchovies. Yeah, I know. But the rest of the time he \njust sat there, smoking; sometimes looking into space, sometime staring at \nthat wooden table of his. \nAnd yeah, I remembered the pattern was kind of hypnotic and I spent more \nthan a couple of minutes staring at it myself when I was there, but he did \nalmost nothing else. \nWho knows, perhaps he had a rich and fulfilling life outside of the flat. He \ncertainly left it regularly enough, and yeah, I wasn’t so far gone as to actually \nfollow him. If fact, I always waited a good long while before leaving my own \nbuilding to make sure I didn’t bump into him. I still didn’t want him to know \nwhere I lived, although now for very different reasons. In the end, though, it \nwas a hobby, not an obsession, and often days would pass when I wouldn’t see \nGraham at all. Maybe there was stuff I missed that would have explained his \nbehaviour. I just wish I’d missed what happened on April 7th. Then maybe I’d \nhave just thought he’d moved on or… I don’t know. I just wish I hadn’t seen it. \nWork had been intense for a couple of months, with so many late nights I’d \nhad to drop out of my cour", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 4, "chunk_count": 9, "chars": 4500}}
