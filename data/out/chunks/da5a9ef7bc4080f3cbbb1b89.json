They didn’t \nappear to be fear. Liz was irritated by this as, even though the results still \nlooked good for a general ESP study, the variation in response tone would \napparently muddy the research in ways she wasn’t keen on. \nI only saw Annabelle Cane once during this period. She wasn’t hard to pick out. \nShe dressed like a vintage clothing store exploded on her, and her short \nbleach-blonde hair stood out sharply against dark skin. The first time I saw her \nI’d liked her. She looked like the kind of student who occasionally talked to \ncleaners like we were people. Not that we ever actually spoke, but she had \nthat air about her. \n\nThis time, though, it was just as she was leaving the mirror room. She was \nwalking strangely, like her trousers didn’t fit her right. She kept bending her \nknees at kind of odd angles, holding herself with this stiffness. Her arm was \nextended, and she ran her hand along the wall as she went, moving her fingers \nrapidly so it scuttled like... well, like a spider with its legs missing. \nEven then I didn’t really start to consider what might be happening. No, I didn’t \ntake it seriously until what happened last Thursday. I’d pulled a late shift and \nhad just finished my first sweep of the labs. I’d made a start on mopping the \ncorridors leading up to the rooms Liz had been using, when I noticed the lights \nwere still on. \nNow, she’d mentioned that that afternoon they were trying the first sessions \nwith all nineteen of the remaining projectors – they’d had a predictably high \ndropout rate. Now, I know that the more people you have involved in a test, \nthe longer it tends to take and the more potential there is for delays, so it \nmight well have overrun, but it was half nine in the evening by that point, so it \nseemed very unlikely it would have gone on that long. I thought maybe they’d \njust left the lights on by accident. These things happen. I did my best to forget \nthat the lights in those rooms were normally motion activated. I hope someday \nI’ll forget what I saw when I opened that door, but I won’t. \nAll the arachnophobes, Liz’s “projectors”, were stood in two circles, the one \ninside of the other. Their hands and arms were locked together in a complex, \ninterlocking pattern and they walked around, rotating the whole thing slowly \nbut surely. Liz wasn’t there, but in the corner I could see one of her postgrad \nstudents, I think his was Mark, standing there, staring like he was in some sort \nof trance. I mean, they all looked like they were in a trance. \n\nThe other side of the glass I could see Annabelle Cane stood there, staring at \nthem. Her body was hunched over and contorted in a way that was definitely \nnot natural, and I really want it to have been a trick of the light, but for a \nsecond it looked like she had more than two eyes. Almost as soon as I opened \nthe room, the movement of the circle stopped abruptly and their heads \nsnapped to face me all at once. \nI froze in panic. They dropped their arms to the side, and for a moment I was \nsure they were going to attack me, but instead they turned back towards the \nwindow, towards Annabelle, and walked up to it, lining close in front of the \nglass. With a sudden, jerky motion they drew their heads back, then slammed \nthem into the mirrored window, shattering it all at once. I wanted to run, but I \ncouldn’t will my body to move. \nI just stood there, watching the blood run down from the cuts in their \nforeheads, as Annabelle began to climb through the broken window, her limbs \nmoving and reaching, slowly and deliberately. The others didn’t move a muscle \nas she crawled over them, then over the floor towards me. When she was \nabout a foot away from me, she drew herself up to her full height. I don’t know \nexactly how tall she had been before but now she loomed over me by almost a \nfull foot. \nHer eyes locked on mine and I began to feel something. It was like a hundred \ntiny, scurrying legs inside my skull, moving and scampering through my mind. I \nfelt my hands, which had dropped to the side of my body, begin to raise. They \ngripped my legs and then, apparently of their own accord, they began to crawl \nup me, climbing slowly over my stomach, my chest, my shoulders, until, finally, \nthey came to rest upon my throat. I’ve never been a strong man but that didn’t \nseem to matter as my own fingers began to close around my neck like a vice.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 3, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 4459}}
