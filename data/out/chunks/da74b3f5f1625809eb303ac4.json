I mean, it… it’s \nwhat we do. \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nNo, what we do is research statements. Usually those made by liars and the \nmentally unwell. \n \nMARTIN \nWell, I need to tell someone what happened, and you can vouch for the \nsoundness of my mind, can't you? \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nThat is beside the point. \n \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG022 – Colony \n2 \n \nMARTIN \nIf you're that worried about it, it doesn't need to be an official statement. I just \nneed a record of it. \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nFine. You're right. I suppose. Statement of Martin Blackwood, archival assistant \nat the Magnus Institute, London, regarding... \n \nMARTIN \nA close encounter with something I believe to have once been Jane… Prentiss. \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nRecorded direct from subject, 12th March, 2016. Statement begins. \n \nMARTIN \nWell, a couple of weeks ago, you were looking into that statement about the \nspider that wouldn't go away. Carlos… Vittery I think his name was? I knew \nthere was something not right about the whole thing from the off. I said it \nprobably wasn't natural, him dying and being encased in web when he was \nfound, and I stand by that, though it wasn't anything to do with spiders that \nended up after me. Almost wish it had been. \n(Nervous Laugher) \nI like spiders. Big ones, at least. Y’know, y’know the ones you can see some fur \non; I actually think they're sort of cute… \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nPlease stick to the statement, Martin. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG022 – Colony \n3 \n \n \nMARTIN \nRight. You asked me to investigate that flat that he lived in down in Boothby \nRoad, and that's what I do. I take the Northern Line up to Archway and walk \nthe rest of the way down there. It's still quite early then, and I find the building \neasily enough. It looks just like Mr. Vittery said it did in his statement, and \nthere's a big thick door on the front, that looks like it leads into the hall and \nthen to the flats. Obviously it's locked so I try the buzzers, but nobody's \nanswering and I figure they're probably all out at work. I didn't want to come \nback to you without due diligence, though – I’ve learned that lesson – so I have \na look around the place to see if there's another way I could go in and have a \npoke around. Sure enough, as I walk round, I spy a basement window that's \nslightly ajar. It isn't much, but I reckon I can squeeze through it if I try. \nAs I get… closer, though, I notice there's something on the ground, nearby. The \nsunlight catches on it and at first I think it must be a screw or a little piece of \nmetal that someone's thrown away. I get closer and I see that it looks more like \na worm of some sort. It's maybe an inch long, with a silver segmented body \nthat goes black at one end, almost like it’s been burned. It's very… still, so I \nkneel down to have a look and as I get closer it begins to twitch. Its darkened \nhead twists towards me and it starts to… writhe in this kind of eerie way, \nmoving along the ground very fast and straight at me. \n \nWell, to be honest I… I freaked out a bit. I leapt to my feet and I just stamped \non it before I had a chance to really think about what I was doing. I felt it pop \nbeneath my shoe with a faint cracking sound, like stepping on an eggshell, and \na thick, black slime started to ooze from where I stepped on it. Now, obviously \nI was pretty disgusted by the whole thing, so I take a moment to scrape off", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 0, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 3772}}
