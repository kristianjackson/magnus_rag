I recognised the glassy stare. The same eyes \nthat gazed at me from a hundred sawdust filled sockets around the room. \nWhen they all began to move, I nearly broke down. If I had, I have no doubt \nthat I would be dead. Or maybe far worse. Instead, I had a sudden rush of \nadrenaline and charged into Daniel, knocking him sprawling to the floor in \nsurprise. It was like hitting a sandbag. His two Cockney friends were too slow \nto grab me before I was off down the road. I may not look like it, but I can \nmove at a fair pace when I need to. And I did so for almost an hour before I \nfinally felt safe enough to stop. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 054 – Still Life \n12 \n \nI was very lucky, you know. I had the foresight to gather all my notes before I \nopened the basement door. It meant I didn’t have to return. I could simply \nwrite them up a glowing report and never think about it again. Save for giving \nyou my statement, of course. And that’s exactly what I did. After all, whatever \nall that other stuff was, they weren’t laundering money. \nARCHIVIST \nStatement ends. \nIt was with some trepidation that I made the discovery that The Trophy Room \nis still in business and still under the proprietorship of Daniel Rawlings. It’s the \nsort of lead we never get in these cases: still active and available for \ninvestigation. However, given the events detailed here, I had some very serious \nreservations about sending anyone to investigate. I may not entirely trust my \nassistants, but I won’t lose them. \nEventually Sasha volunteered. I warned her it might be dangerous, but she did \nseem very keen. It turned out to be rather a let-down in the end. Sinister as the \ntaxidermy was, there was apparently no figure in the basement, which \nRawlings was happy to let her investigate, nor any obvious weirdness to any \nother aspect of the shop. Rawlings denies any memory of specifically Cockney \ndelivery men, but I’m sure I don’t need to spell out my suspicions there. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 054 – Still Life \n13 \n \nThere’s nothing we can prove, and if he doesn’t want to talk, there’s precious \nlittle we can do to change his mind. He also denies being the Daniel Rawlings \nwho disappeared from Edinburgh in 2006. He allowed Sasha to take a \nphotograph of him and I’ve been comparing the pictures available for the \nDaniel Rawlings who disappeared. It’s the strangest thing; they’re different \nheights, different builds, different shapes to the face, but their hair is identical. \nTheir eyes, on the other hand, are not, and I find it to hard credit that they \ncould be the same person. (Sigh) Another dead end. \nEnd recording. \n[Tape clicks off. Tape clicks on.] \nSupplemental. \nI broke into Gertrude’s flat. I was doing some digging when I discovered that \nher home had not yet been re-let. A quick discussion with the agent confirmed \nthat there were some legal delays due to the manner of her disappearance and \ndeath, and she was paid up for the next six months, so they hadn’t yet cleared \nit out. So, I broke in. It wasn’t easy and the window meant that I didn’t get a lot \nof time before I heard sirens, but I think I got away with it. \nI learned a few things from this.
