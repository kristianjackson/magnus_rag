Original statement given February 11th 2012. Audio recording by \nJonathan Sims, Head Archivist of the Magnus Institute, London. \nStatement begins. \nJONATHAN SIMS \nI’m a nurse at St Thomas hospital, down in Lambeth near Waterloo Station. \nTechnically these days I work at Guys and St Thomas NHS Foundation Trust, \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG012 – First Aid \n2 \n \nbut Guys Hospital is at a completely different site the other side of London, so \nfor the sake of clarity, I work at St Thomas. Christmas is one of the worst \nperiods to be working at a hospital, and in the Accident and Emergency \ndepartment it’s even more unpleasant. Pensioners who can’t afford to \nproperly heat their homes, drunken party-goers who overindulge and hurt \nthemselves, even just people who didn’t look where they were going and \nslipped on a patch of ice. Christmas brings out the side of people that always \nseems to lead them to the hospital, so I was relieved last year when I got my \nshift pattern and learned my last A&E shift of the season was going to be on \nthe 23rd, two full days before Christmas itself. That was the good news. The \nbad news was the 23rd was also the Friday immediately before the big day, \nand that meant people finishing work for the holidays and going out for some \ncelebration. When you work in Accident and Emergency, there are few words \nthat fill your heart with such dread as the word “celebration”. \nThat night wasn’t as bad as some I’d seen, a few broken bones and a couple of \ndrug-fuelled injuries, but no fights or angry drunks, which was a blessing. It \nmust have been about half-past one in the morning that the ambulance \narrives. They had radioed ahead and we knew that we had a pair of severe \nburn victims being brought in, so we were as ready as we could have been. I \nwas heading out to meet the ambulance, when I noticed that the A&E waiting \nroom was totally silent. I looked around and there were all the people there \nthat I expected to see, some cradling obvious injuries, but none of them made \na sound. They continued to stare at their phone, read books, comfort one \nanother, but not one of them spoke. I didn’t have much time to really consider \nwhat I was seeing as, at that moment, I heard the ambulance pull up outside \nand ran off to see to the patient.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 0, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 2896}}
