It's very… still, so I \nkneel down to have a look and as I get closer it begins to twitch. Its darkened \nhead twists towards me and it starts to… writhe in this kind of eerie way, \nmoving along the ground very fast and straight at me. \n \nWell, to be honest I… I freaked out a bit. I leapt to my feet and I just stamped \non it before I had a chance to really think about what I was doing. I felt it pop \nbeneath my shoe with a faint cracking sound, like stepping on an eggshell, and \na thick, black slime started to ooze from where I stepped on it. Now, obviously \nI was pretty disgusted by the whole thing, so I take a moment to scrape off \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG022 – Colony \n4 \n \nwhat's left of it and check around for any more. There's none that I can see, so \nafter composing myself for a couple of seconds, I continue on my way into the \nbasement. The window was small. Quite a tight squeeze for me, I mean, I'm \nnot exactly the smallest guy in the world, I know, and it's only once I'm inside \nthat I realise it's only at ground level for the outside, so I take a bit of a tumble \nonto the basement floor. \nLuckily I get away without hurting myself and start to have a quick look around \nthe room. It's pretty big, and it looks like it goes under pretty much the whole \nbuilding, but the light from the window doesn't get very far inside so most of \nthe place was very dark. Then I realise that I don't have any sort of torch with \nme, and I can't see any light switch on the nearby wall, so I've no real way of \nlooking round. I almost decided to turn around and try to climb out back the \nway I came, not least because the place had a really bad ‘feeling’ to it. Like, like \nthere was this musty smell, and the air was dusty and thick. \nAlso, you're going to think I'm an idiot when I say this, but I didn't like the way \nmy… shadow moved. The light from the window behind me cast it pretty \nclearly on the floor, and looking at it I swear the edges seemed to move. It was \nlike a… like a, like an undulation, like, like they were being shifted by \nsomething. I mean… look, I know you hate the word, but it was really… spooky. \nLook, anyway, that was when I saw the bottom of the stairs leading up, and I, I \ndidn't waste any time heading up them. The door at the top wasn't locked, so I \nfind myself in the ground floor hall of the building and I'll admit it was a real \nrelief to get out of that place and into the well-lit main building. I could have \nleft at that point, probably should have, but I decided to try one more time to \nsee if I could talk to the current occupants of Mr. Vittery's old flat. \nDue diligence… and all that. So I, I head up to number four and give a few \nknocks on the door. I didn't expect anyone to be in, but the door's opened by", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 1, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 2832}}
