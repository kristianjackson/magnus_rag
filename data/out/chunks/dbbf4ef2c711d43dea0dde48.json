And I just want to point out that I didn’t make this much of a fuss. \nJONATHAN SIMS \n (Heavy Breathing) \nI think your removal was substantially cleaner. \nSASHA \n I’m still not sure why you have this. Drinking in the archives? \nMARTIN \n What? No, no, it’s for worms. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG039 – Infestation \n4 \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \n What? MARTIN \n For pulling the worms out of people. Like now. \nSASHA \n You, er... what? \nMARTIN \n I used to carry around a knife, but I started thinking that, well, cutting into someone laterally wasn’t \nreally the most efficient way to get them out, and besides which, they seem to be quite slow \nburrowing in a straight line so, given their size, th-the corkscrew just seemed to be the better option. \n… Look, you guys got to go home every day, okay. I didn’t! I’ve been thinking for a long time about \nwhat to do when… well, y’know, this happens. \nJONATHAN SIMS \n Well... thank you. \nSASHA \n That’s why we’re here? \nMARTIN \n Yeah. The room’s sealed, I checked it myself when I moved in. \n JONATHAN SIMS \n Climate controlled, as well. Strong door. Soundproof. [Sigh] These old files are far better protected \nthan we ever were. Alright, I’ll grant you it’s a good place to lay low, but— \nSASHA \n They could still come in through the air con. \nJONATHAN SIMS \n Not easily. And… not en masse. It is actually safe. \nMARTIN \n Ha! \nJONATHAN SIMS \n Except, of course, that we’re trapped. \nMARTIN \n Ah… yeah. Sorry.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 0, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 3363}}
