If you're desperate, they shouldn't be hard to identify, but it's not \nreally relevant to what happened. \nYou ever heard of 'The Graveyard of the Atlantic'? Probably not, and it's a \nconfusing name anyway since it actually refers to two distinct locations along \nthe eastern coast of North America, both notorious hotspots for shipwrecks. In \nthis case, I'm talking about the one off Sable Island in Nova Scotia. The waters \nare some of the roughest, where the Gulf Stream hits the Labrador Current, \nand depending on which historical records you believe, there could be \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG051 – High Pressure \n3 \n \nanything from four to 600 shipwrecks down there, and that's only from when \nthe European settlers first arrived. \nNormally it's not the sort of place where we would accept jobs. It's too \ndangerous to send a salvage crew in when the waters are that unpredictable. \nBut this time was different. Maybe the old man was just a real sweet-talker or \nmaybe he slipped the captain, a leathery old cuss by the name of Morton \nKemp, just enough extra under the table that he fudged the location on the \nrelease forms. Either way, word came down that we were doing a dive off \nSable Island. \nNone of that was to say the captain was stupid about it. We kept a very close \neye on the meteorological reports and only headed into the graveyard when \nwe were certain we'd have a window of relatively calm seas to do it. It helped \nthat the job was relatively simple. The old man, Simon Fairchild, had come to \nus claiming that he had pinpointed the location he believed his great-\ngrandfather's sailing yacht had been sunk almost 120 years ago, and he was \nkeen to retrieve any heirlooms or curios he could from it. The only thing \ninteresting or unusual about his story was the amount of money he was willing \nto throw around to back it up. It was certainly enough to get us dropping \nanchor a hundred miles from the coast on a hot, sunny morning at the end of \nAugust. \nThe journey out had been a bit subdued. Normally me and Julio Hernandez, \nthe other diver on the crew, would spend our time chatting, playing cards and \nonce even screwing, though we generally don't talk about that. This time we \nhad to babysit Mr Fairchild, who had stubbornly insisted that he make the \njourney with us. Again, this wouldn't normally have been an option, but the \nguy was not shy about throwing his money around. He must have been \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG051 – High Pressure \n4 \n \npushing a hundred years old, just a tiny pink skeleton of a man, sat in the \ncorner watching us the whole trip. It was hard to get any sort of friendly chat \ngoing with him perched there like some sort of vulture. I tried to talk to him a \nfew times, but he only seemed interested in discussing this shipwreck and how \npreserved I thought everything might be. I told him I had no idea, as it really \nwasn't my area. I was just the diver. He didn't say much to me after that. \nWhen we hit the graveyard, the sea was almost completely still, far more so \nthan I would have expected, even given the weather predictions we'd been \nworking on. It didn't strike me as odd at the time, just an unexpected bit of \nhelp with the job. Initial checks managed to locate a wreck that seemed to \nmatch the old man's description, a steam yacht, circa 1890. It seemed to be in \nsurprisingly good shape and in the camera's torchlight we could just about \nmake out the name: The Maria Fairchild. The old man was practically dancing \nwith joy and I was genuinely concerned he might give himself a heart attack. \nWe suited up and prepared to go under. The wreck was at a depth of 160 feet, \nwhich meant we'd be in a high-pressure environment, but we shouldn't need \nhypoxic gas or full pressure suits, which was something of a relief. Julio made \nhis prayers, Captain Kemp gave us a stern nod, and into the water we went. As \nI went in, I thought I heard Simon, the old man, shout after me, but I couldn't \nmake it out. And then the world was nothing but silent blue. I had expected \nthe water to be warmer, given the temperature on the surface, but the chill hit \nme all at once and it took a moment to get to grips with it. I saw Julio next to \nme, a few yards away, and with a thumbs up, we began to dive down towards \nthe sunken boat. \nMost people don't appreciate how quickly it gets dark underwater.
