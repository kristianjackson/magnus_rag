Detective. \nBASIRA \nI’m not a detective. \nELIAS \nOf course. \nBASIRA \nYou wanted to see me? \nELIAS \nYes. \nBASIRA \nSomething ‘too important’ to tell the Inspector? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 127 – Remains to be Seen \n \n17 \n \nELIAS \nMaybe I just wanted to have a chat. \nBASIRA \nWell, good luck with that. \n[Rattling of chain and handcuffs] \nELIAS \nI found one of these in my cell. It wasn’t recording, but I assume this means \nhe’s awake. \nBasira? \nBASIRA \nCan we cut the bullshit? \nELIAS \nWhat bullshit might that be? \nBASIRA \nThe part where you pretend you don’t spend your whole time watching us? \nELIAS \nSometimes I’m eating. \nBASIRA \nYou know he’s back. You’ve seen him. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 127 – Remains to be Seen \n \n18 \n \nELIAS \nFine. Yes. \nBASIRA \nSo, what’s with the recorder? Who gave it you? \nELIAS \nOh, no, that… that really did just appear in my cell. \nBASIRA \nRight. So, what, you figured you'd record us for him? Sow some distrust from \nafar? \nELIAS \nOur ‘arrangement’ with the Inspector notwithstanding, I rather feel that right \nnow all the distrust is very much your own. And as to whether he’ll ever hear \nthis... maybe he’ll get the tapes, maybe he won’t, but the recordings have \nhelped so far, so... \nBASIRA \nDo you know what they are? \nELIAS \nWhat a question. \nBASIRA \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 127 – Remains to be Seen \n \n19 \n \nFine. So, you won’t see him, but you’re happy for him to hear our \nconversations. \nELIAS \nHe can listen all he wants, but he’s at a very delicate stage right now and I fear \nmy presence would be a, uh, distraction. I’ve made it clear my cooperation is \ncontingent on his not seeing me, and my terms have been accepted thus far. \nBASIRA \nSo, why am I here? What do you want that’s so important you needed to tell \nme to my face? \nELIAS \nI believe you recently lost Melanie. \nBASIRA \nWe saved Melanie. \nELIAS \nAs a person, yes. But as a defender... I would have thought you would want all \nthe help you could get, or have you forgotten what happened last time you let \nyour guard down? \nBASIRA \nWe’ll work it out. \nELIAS \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 127 – Remains to be Seen \n \n20 \n \nPossibly. Then again, you are beset by enemies on all sides, Basira. And, unless \nyou expect John to record them into submission, it would seem you are in \nrather dire need of another option. \nBASIRA \nAnd you just happen to have one. \nELIAS \nI might have an idea, yes. \nBASIRA \nAnd what does it cost? \nELIAS \nJust some of your time, Basira. Just your time. \n[Deep sigh] \nBASIRA \nOkay. Let’s hear it. \n[Tape clicks off] \n[The Magnus Archives Theme – Outro] \nThe Magnus Archives is a podcast distributed by Rusty Quill and licensed under \na Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Sharealike 4.0 International \nlicence.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 5, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 2776}}
