But he didn’t make me fire it. I \ndid that myself. He fell limp to the floor. I don’t know if he was dead, but I \nhope so. I’d hate it if that place had to bleed him. \nThe door behind him led to a corridor I recognised, and the next door I found \nmarked ‘Exit’ opened to a sunny day so bright that I could barely see. There \nwere people there, other workers, but no-one paid me any attention. I left the \nslaughterhouse, and didn’t go back. I kept expecting the police to call me about \nTom, but I never heard his name mentioned again. Not even when I handed in \nmy resignation. I wish I felt bad about his death, but I don’t. I don’t feel \nanything at all. \nJONATHAN SIMS \nStatement ends. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG030 – Killing Floor \n10 \n \nHmm. More meat. Interesting. I had Sasha do some basic corroboration of the \nparticulars of Mr. Laylow’s tale, and everything appears to be more or less \naccurate. He was employed by Aver Meats in Dalston from April 2010 to the \n12th of July 2013, at which point left his post, which was confirmed to be the \nstunning the cattle for processing, in the middle of his shift, along with Thomas \nHaan, one of his colleagues. They left through the main entrance, ignoring the \nother workers, though no-one reported them acting strangely aside from that. \nNeither returned to the abattoir and Tom Haan has not been seen since. \nWe contacted Mr. Laylow for a follow-up statement, which he gave readily \nenough, though it largely deals with his lingering problems eating meat, which I \nwould say are symptoms of PTSD but he has strongly declined to seek \ntreatment. \nTim and Martin had a bit more luck investigating Tom Haan, though only really \nenough to confirm that he seems to have completely vanished following his \ndeparture from Aver Meats on the 12th of July. No missing person report was \nfiled, and he appears to have had no friends or family. The landlord of the \nhouse he rented in Walthamstow, claims that the last rent he received from \nHaan was at the beginning of July. This landlord was quite put out when he \ndisappeared, as apparently he had been renting a house in Clarence Road for \nalmost a decade, and it was in quite a state of disrepair when he left. \nImmigration authorities are somewhat useless. They have informed us that he \nmissed a meeting with his advisor later that year, but it wasn’t until October, \nso gives us little to go on. His bank account has also registered no activity since \nJuly the 6th. No official effort has been made to locate him, and the police \nwere reluctant to open a new case, so we didn’t push it. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG030 – Killing Floor \n11 \n \nThere’s little else to be looked into, as Mr. Laylow’s description of an endless \nslaughterhouse is, to put it generously, unverifiable. That said, there have \nrecently been moves by Aver Meats to extend their Dalston plant. They have \nplanning permission, but are apparently having trouble retaining builders, four \nof which have already quit. Only one of them, Darren Lacey, agreed to talk to \nus, but all he would say to Tim was that the building “already seemed to be \nway too big.” And he said he couldn’t get over the smell of blood. \nRecording ends. \n[The Magnus Archives Theme - Outro] \n \nThe Magnus Archives is a podcast distributed by Rusty Quill and licensed under \na creative commons attribution, non-commercial share alike 4.0 international \nlicense.
