Like with you. \nSometimes it meant I lost them. \nARCHIVIST \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 133 – Dead Horse \n \n12 \n \nOne of the bits I’ve managed to decode from Gertrude’s notes, it references \nsomething she calls “The Everchase”. You think that might be it? The ritual that \nnever ends because the Hunt is all in the pursuit? \nDAISY \nI don’t know. You’re the expert. \nARCHIVIST \nNo, no. I like it. It’s a good theory. \nDAISY \nBasira said you could just “know” all this now anyway. \nARCHIVIST \nIt’s, uh, I can’t really control it. \n[Door opens] \nARCHIVIST \nOh. \nBASIRA \nHey, there you are. You’re meant to be doing your exercises. \nDAISY \nYou were out. \nBASIRA \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 133 – Dead Horse \n \n13 \n \nYou could have done them alone. \nDAISY \nSure. \nARCHIVIST \nEverything alright? \nBASIRA \nYeah... Daisy, could you give us a minute? \nDAISY \nOh. Should I...? \nBASIRA \nYeah, please. \nDAISY \nSure. \n[Door closes] \nARCHIVIST \nAre you...? \nBASIRA \nJohn, is that her? \nARCHIVIST \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 133 – Dead Horse \n \n14 \n \nWhat? \nBASIRA \nYou’ve had people switched before, right? Replaced? \nARCHIVIST \nI mean, s-sure, but... \nBASIRA \nHow sure are you that that’s the real Daisy? \nARCHIVIST \nUh, I’m sure. Basira, that’s her. \nBASIRA \nBut do you… Do you know? \nARCHIVIST \nYes. Why? \nBASIRA \nHmm. \nARCHIVIST \nTalk to me, Basira. Is she ... wrong in some way? \nBASIRA \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 133 – Dead Horse \n \n15 \n \nNo. No, she still sounds like her, says things Daisy would say, laughs like her. \nShe just seems ... lost. \nI want it to be her. \nARCHIVIST \nDo you? \nBASIRA \nWhat’s that supposed to mean? \nARCHIVIST \nShe’s trying to keep a clear head, to stay away from the Hunt as much as \npossible. You valued her purpose, her resolve. The sort of things— \nBASIRA \nI get it. It’s her. \nARCHIVIST \nWe’ve all changed, Basira. \nBASIRA \nYeah, I just... I didn’t realise she’d change into someone who can’t look after \nherself. Even without the muscle atrophy— \nARCHIVIST \nYou were hoping for a defender. \nBASIRA \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 133 – Dead Horse \n \n16 \n \nI was hoping for someone I can trust to share the load. Because right now it’s \nall on me. \nARCHIVIST \nIt doesn’t have to be. \nBASIRA \nHmm. \nARCHIVIST \nYou’re not happy she’s back? \nBASIRA \nI didn’t say that, John! I will never abandon Daisy, and having her back is— But \nright now, she’s dead weight, and I need to be able to travel light. \nARCHIVIST \nYou’re starting to sound like Gertrude. \nBASIRA \nGood. Far as I can see, Gertrude Robinson was the most effective person in this \nplace. \nARCHIVIST \nThat’s what Tim said as well. Look, I’ve been where you are. \n \nBASIRA \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 133 – Dead Horse \n \n17 \n \nHave you? \nARCHIVIST \nYes, I have. Like you’re the only one responsible for everyone, the weight of all \ntheir lives on your shoulders? It leads to bad decisions. \nBASIRA \nYeah, well, when I get myself kidnapped three times in a row, maybe I’ll look to \nyou for advice. \nARCHIVIST \nBad decisions like wasting three weeks chasing dead ends and false leads \nrather than talking to us about the plan. \nBASIRA \nI told you not to look in my head. \nARCHIVIST \nI didn’t. This one’s just me. You’ve not mentioned anything about where you \nwere, avoided talking about anything you learned, and that file you were \nstudying the clippings from? Empty. \nBASIRA \nMaybe I found something and I’m not sharing. \nARCHIVIST \nYou didn’t, though, did you? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 133 – Dead Horse \n \n18 \n \nBASIRA \nI had good intelligence. \nARCHIVIST \nWhich you charged off to investigate without telling anyone. You know who \nthat reminds me of? \nBASIRA \nDrop it. \nARCHIVIST \nFine. I don’t care if you trust me, but I think I’ve proven at the very least that \nI’m useful. So, use me. Because if you go it alone, you are going to die. Even \nGertrude worked with people. We make bad decisions when we don't \ncommunicate. \nBASIRA \nYou literally jumped into a spooky coffin without telling anybody. \nARCHIVIST \nCase in point. \nBASIRA \nOkay. \nARCHIVIST", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 5, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 4055}}
