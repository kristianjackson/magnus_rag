I shall miss our little chats. \n[Tape clicks off. Tape clicks on.] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 148 – Extended Surveillance \n \n7 \n \nARCHIVIST \nWell? \nBASIRA \nJust useless gloating, like I said he would. \nARCHIVIST \nYou should have let me come with. \nBASIRA \nNo. Besides, he wouldn’t have seen me if I had. \nARCHIVIST \nCan’t believe you’ve been seeing him all this time. \nBASIRA \nOh yeah, that’s the terrible secret sabotaging the trust between us. \nARCHIVIST \nDid he mention it at all? My, uh … \nBASIRA \nOh, your new diet? Nothing useful. Didn’t seem too phased by it. \nARCHIVIST \n(Sighs) Right. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 148 – Extended Surveillance \n \n8 \n \nBASIRA \nWhat? \nARCHIVIST \nI don’t know. I mean, we still don’t really know what Elias actually is. I thought \nmaybe if he was more like me than we realised ... \nBASIRA \nHe might have some advice? \nARCHIVIST \nStupid, I know. \nBASIRA \nYeah. John, we’ve been over this. The key is to not force people to feed you \ntheir trauma. You know, just don’t do it. \nARCHIVIST \nIt’s not that simple. \nBASIRA \nNo, it is. Or I put you down. \nARCHIVIST \n(Mutters) I mean, that’s hardly … \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 148 – Extended Surveillance \n \n9 \n \nBASIRA \nDaisy’s been managing. \nARCHIVIST \nDaisy is... Yeah, she’s managing. Did he say anything about Annabelle? \nBASIRA \nNot really. Sounds like he’s not too worried, though. Says to just ignore it. \nARCHIVIST \nYeah, good luck with that. \nBASIRA \nAny luck finding her? \nARCHIVIST \nHaven’t really been trying. Doing that sort of thing consciously ... makes me \nhungry. \nBASIRA \nOh, well then, find a statement to your tastes and read it. \nARCHIVIST \nYes, yes, I know. \nThank you. \n(The Archivist sighs.) \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 148 – Extended Surveillance \n \n10 \n \nBasira? \nBASIRA \nYeah? \nARCHIVIST \nI've been meaning to ask. The tape, the one of the, uh... my victim. You said \nMartin gave it to you? \nBASIRA \nYeah. \nARCHIVIST \nHow was he? H-how did he look? Was he, uh …? \nBASIRA \nI don’t know. I didn’t see him. He just left it on my desk with a note. \nARCHIVIST \nOh, right. \nBASIRA \nYeah. \nARCHIVIST \nCan I ask what it said? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 148 – Extended Surveillance \n \n11 \n \nBASIRA \nUm, yeah. It said, “Talk to him.” \n(The Archivist laughs bitterly.) \nARCHIVIST \nI’m going to get something to eat. \n[Tape clicks off. Tape clicks on.] \nARCHIVIST \nStatement of Sunil Maraj, regarding their work as a security guard and the \ndisappearance of their co-worker Samson Stiller. Original statement given 3rd \nApril 2011. Audio recording by Jonathan Sims, the Archivist. \nStatement begins. \nARCHIVIST (STATEMENT) \nSo, I lost my job last week. I mean, I quit – they didn’t fire me or nothing – but \nyou know how, like, sometimes you quit because you want to and sometimes \nyou quit because you’ve got to? Well, this was the second, although I’m not \ngoing to pretend that I’m not glad to see the back of the place. It’s cos I kept \nasking about Samson, you know? And what I saw. And they really, really don’t \nwant me to make a stink about that. Because if he just disappeared one day, \ndidn’t come into work, that’s fine. I mean, not fine for his family, obviously, or \nfor the police who have to find him, but fine for the company. If he \ndisappeared at work, though, if what I think happened is even close to what \nactually happened, then that’s real bad news for them, and opens them up to", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 1, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 3491}}
