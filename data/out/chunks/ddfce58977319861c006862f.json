Even when we crested the ridge, \nand the rest of us tried to drown out the deafening thrum of artillery with our \nown charging cry, even then he made no sound. \nThe ground shook with the impact of the mortar shells, and I ran from foxhole \nto crater to foxhole, keeping my head low to avoid the bullets. As I ran, I felt a \nshooting pain in my ankle and pitched forward into the mud. Looking down, I \nsaw I’d been caught by a length of barbed wire, half-hidden by the damp \nupturned soil. I felt a surge of panic begin to overtake me and frantically tried \nto remove the wire from my leg but only succeeded in getting my hand \nscratched up quite badly. I looked around desperately to see if there was \nanyone else nearby who could help. And there, not twenty yards in front of \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG00X – The Piper \n5 \n \nme, I saw Wilfred standing, his face blank and his head swaying to some \nunheard rhythm. And then I did hear it – gently riding over the pulse of \nmortars and the rattle of guns and the moans of dying men, a faint, piping \nmelody. I could not have told you whether it was bagpipes or panpipes or \nsome instrument I had never heard before but its whistling tune was \nunmistakable and struck me with a deepest sadness and a gentle creeping fear \nand in that moment I knew what was about to happen. \nI looked at Wilfred, and as our eyes met I saw that he knew as well. I heard a \nsingle gunshot, much louder than any of the others somehow, and I saw him \ngo stiff, his eyes wide. And then the mortar blast hit him and he was lost in an \neruption of mud and earth. I had plenty of time to mourn him, lying in that \ndreadful hole until nightfall, when I could free my leg as quietly and gently as \npossible before crawling back to our trench. It was slow going; every time a \nflare went up I could only lay motionless and pray, but the good Lord saw fit to \nlet me reach our line relatively unscathed. I was quickly bundled off to the field \nhospital, which was overburdened as always. They didn’t have much in the way \nof medicine or staff to spare, and certainly no beds free, so they washed my \nwounds with iodine, bandaged them, sent me on my way. Told me to come \nback if I got gangrene. I did have a look around the place to see if I could find \nWilfred, but there was no sign of him to be found anywhere. Asking around the \ntrench, no-one had seen him return among the wounded, so I began to \nreconcile myself to the fact that he was dead. He wasn’t the first friend I’d lost \nto the Germans nor even the first I’d seen die in front of me, but something \nabout that strange music that I heard in the moments before that explosion \nlingered in my mind and left me dwelling on Wilfred in many a quiet moment.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 2, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 2797}}
