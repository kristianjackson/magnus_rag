An urban legend, I guess you could call it. Not quite a ghost story, not \nquite a joke, not quite a real thing. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG042 – Grifter’s Bone \n2 \n \nSometimes they’re a band, sometime it’s just the one guy. If the story has \nthem as a band, then the only one whose name the old timer knows – because \nit’s always the old timers telling these stories – is a guy named Alfred Grifter. \nSome will swear blind it’s his real name, others will just give you a knowing \nlook and ask if it sounds real. Fact is, no-one knows a damn thing about him \nexcept the name he goes by, so it’s all just story and gossip, but there’s still \nplenty to go around. \nStory goes of a mediocre musician with a hunger for more, who turns to the \ndark arts, usually devil worship or witchcraft, but gets it wrong. I’ve heard it \ntold as a curse, a badly worded wish or even a devil that just gets mad at being \nsummoned and beats him ‘til his hands don’t work. \nThe end is always the same, though: his music is so grating, so gut-churningly \nawful, that he, or sometimes his band, have to sneak into gigs to play \nunannounced to any audience they can find. And the music is dreadful, a grim \ncacophony of discord and noise, too much to bear. You can always tell when \nGrifter's Bone has been on, they’ll tell you, because of all the torn-off ears. \nThey’re not entirely wrong. \nI’ve been writing for Earful for a while. Used to just be me, firing my music \nthoughts onto a blog, but a few years back my then-friend, now-boss Tommy \nMoncreef said he was starting up a music site, and would I write for it? I said of \ncourse I would, and now here I am running video content for it. Earful.com’s \nonly been around three years or so, but to be honest in the world of music \nsites, that gives us a pretty decent pedigree. Tommy’s from the old school – \nused to write for dozens of music magazines, back in the dead tree days, \nbefore print became an embarrassing older relative that just wouldn’t die. \nPoint is, he knew a lot of older contacts and writers, most of which he brought", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 0, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 2941}}
