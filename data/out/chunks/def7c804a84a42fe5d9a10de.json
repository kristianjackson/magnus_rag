Why \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG037 – Burnt Offering \n2 \n \n \n JONATHAN SIMS \nI just want a record. To make sure I have something I can check. \n \nMARTIN \nOkay, fine. There were two delivery men. They were big, and they spoke with \ncockney accents that might have been fake, and they delivered a package for \nyou. I don’t remember anything else about what they looked like. \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nNothing at all? \n \nMARTIN \nThey looked normal. Like you’d expect. They looked like two, huge, cockney \ndelivery men. I don’t know what else you want? \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nWhat about the table? \n \nMARTIN \nI didn’t see the table. I guess Rosie must have signed for it. I mean, it’s her \noffice on the way to Artefact Storage, that makes sense. \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nShe says the same as you. Two men, doesn’t know how they got in, too \nintimidated to ask, looked “exactly like you’d expect”. Useless... \n \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG037 – Burnt Offering \n3 \n \nMARTIN \nSorry... Look, John, I do think we should destroy the table, though. I mean, if \nit’s the one from Amy Patel’s statement. Just in case. \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nElias told me the same thing. Luckily he phrased it as advice rather than an \ninstruction, so for now I’m more inclined to keep studying it. We’re not in the \nbusiness of destroying knowledge. \n \nMARTIN \nI suppose. Can I go now? \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nYes, go on. \n \nMARTIN \nThank you. \n \n[DOOR OPENS] \nMARTIN \nLook, you need to get some sleep. … I’ll see you later. \n \n[DOOR CLOSES] \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nWaste of tape, really. He’s right. Might as well get some use out of it. \nStatement of Jason North, regarding the discovery of an alleged ritual site \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG037 – Burnt Offering \n4 \n \nfound near Loch Glass in Scotland. Original statement given August 6th 2009. \nAudio recording by Jonathan Sims, Head Archivist of the Magnus Institute, \nLondon. \nStatement begins. \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \n(Read a loud from the archived witness statement of Jason North) \nI just need to know if you can save my son. I’ve asked and asked and your \npeople only ever tell me to write my statement. Put it down on paper for \ninvestigation. Is that going to help? No. Of course it isn’t. Even if you had the \npower to do something, would you? Or would you rather watch my son burn \nso you can take notes. \nI’ve been drinking. You can probably tell from the stains. Well, I don’t plan to \napologise for ruining your precious paper, and I don’t plan to stop. Only way to \nkeep the fear from settling in. If I’m scared I’m going to lose Ethan like I lost \neverything else, then I’ll curl into a ball and never get up. I won’t be able to do \nanything to stop it. I won’t let my son burn, even if you cowards don’t have the \nguts to step up and do something. \nI’m sorry. I know. There’s no-one to blame by my own stupid self. Blundering in \nwhere I had no right to go. But yes, I know, you want the whole goddamn \nstory, don’t you? So you can look over it in ten years and go “Hmm, \ninteresting” long after Ethan and me are dead. Well, fine. There’s not much to \nit, really. For everything it’s done to me, I didn’t really do anything at all. Just \nmessed around in the wrong clearing. \nI’m an ecologist. Was an ecologist. Working for the Forestry Commission up in \nScotland. It was a great job. For me, at least. I suppose if you don’t like hiking", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 0, "chunk_count": 5, "chars": 3854}}
