It was a marvellous view, \nas I recalled, although the quickest and most reliable way to reach it was \nunfortunately by cable car. \nYou see, I don’t do amazingly with heights. I wouldn’t describe it as full vertigo \n– and certainly, when we’re actually at the top of the mountain, I don’t have \nany problem at all if I steer clear of the edges – but traditionally, getting from \nsea level up to the top is something of a trial to me, to say nothing of coming \nback down. I’ve never really shared these fears with Mum, of course. She got \nsuch joy out of it that I wouldn’t want to worry her. Anyway, I remembered the \ncable car up and down Untersberg was a particularly uncomfortable one for \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 124 – Left Hanging \n4 \n \nme. As the car accelerated towards the rickety looking pylons, there was this \njudder as the runners abruptly changed angles, and the car would swing back \nand forth in such a way that I had to sit down on the floor. I told Mum this was \nbecause I found it hard to balance, but honestly, it was so I didn’t have to look \nout the window, at the ground almost a mile below. \nWhen we arrived at the cable car station this time, I was relieved to see that \nthey seemed to have replaced a lot of the structure since the first time we \nwere there. The cables stretched up the mountain, fresh and strong, though \nstill with that disconcerting curve to them. And there was a shine to the cars \nthemselves that I really hoped wasn’t just a fresh paint job. Mum appeared \nquiet and composed, but in that way she does when she gets excited, and we \nbought our tickets and joined the queue without any problems. It was near the \nend of the season and we’d arrived as early as possible, so the queue in this \ncase only comprised of one other passenger: an old man with stark white hair \nand a gentle, amused smile. He had a walking stick in his hand, though his back \nwas straight as an arrow, and it seemed like he only remembered to use it in \nthose moments when he noticed he was still holding it. \nThe day was clear, and the sun illuminated the inside of the car as we stepped \nover the gap from the platform. I knew you’d be able to see for miles and miles \nfrom the top – something I was looking forward to doing when I had my feet \nfirmly on the mountain, less so from the swinging car. The driver stood in the \ncorner of the tiny metal box, looking at us with a bored expression and making \nsome final checks on the controls, which amounted to two buttons and a \nphone. I sat, slightly unsteadily on the rough steel bench as Mum and the old \nman took positions at two of the windows with the best view. The driver \nnodded to himself, slid the door closed and turned a key in the control panel.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 1, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 2916}}
