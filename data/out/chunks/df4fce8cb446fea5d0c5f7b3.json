I also knew that I had to \ngo to 93 Lancaster Road and see for myself. I got my coat and headed out into \nthe night. \nI walked slowly, with a kind of reluctance, so the sky was starting to get light by \nthe time I arrived. I knew what I’d find when I got there, and I was right. There \nwas no sign of Alan, or of whoever he might have seen. There was, however, a \nnew rubbish bag sitting there in its usual place. It was full, and this time the top \nof it had been tied off with a dark green ribbon, arranged in a bow like an old-\nfashioned Christmas present. It bulged in much the same way as the last one. \nI picked up the bag, which turned out to be quite light, and I took off the bow. \nOpening it, I saw shifting white and, for a second, I was sure it was more teeth. \nLooking closer, though, I saw the truth: packing peanuts. Polystyrene packing \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG005 – Thrown Away \n10 \n \npeanuts. Enough to fill the bag to capacity. I almost felt relieved until I realised \nthere was something else in there, something making it heavier than a bag of \npolystyrene should be. I closed my eyes and reached in, expecting to find \nsomething horrible inside. My hand closed instead around cold metal, and I \ndrew out a fist-sized lump of… I think it must have been copper or bronze, and \nhad been roughly carved into the shape of a heart, but like a real heart, not like \na Valentine's one. It was cold to the touch, like it had just come out of a \nfreezer, and it almost stuck to my skin. Engraved on the side was the name \n“Alan Parfitt”, the letters carved in with machine-like precision. That was the \nlast sign of Alan I ever found. As far as I’m aware he’s never been seen since. \nI gave the lump of metal to a friend of mine who works the medical waste run \nand owes me a favour. I asked him to throw it in with a shipment, as the \nmedical incinerators burn hotter than any I have access to, and I figured that \nwas my best shot at getting rid of it properly. I still work the Lancaster Road \nroute, but since then there haven’t been any more weird bags turning up at 93. \nMostly I’ve just tried to forget about it. \nJONATHAN SIMS \nStatement ends. \nIt’s nice to have a statement where most of the particulars are easily verifiable. \nIt comes with shorter supporting statements from David Atayah and Matthew \nWilkinson confirming the contents of the first three bags, as well as the details \nof Alan Parfitt’s behaviour prior to his termination from the employment of \nlocal government. In an uncharacteristic example of actually dealing with \nmodern technology, my predecessor had the good sense to make a copy of the \nfinal text conversation between Alan Parfitt and Mr Woodward.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 6, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 2757}}
