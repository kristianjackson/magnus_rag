I decided \nthat the roads must be the problem – they were what was keeping me trapped \nin this place, constantly turning and bending and confusing me. If I just picked \na direction and kept to it, eventually I had to get to the edge of what, by now, I \nhad decided was a newly built neighbourhood that apparently no-one had \nmoved into yet. As an explanation, it didn’t make any sense, but it didn’t need \nto, not at that moment. \nSo, I started walking, going around houses and through gardens, trying at all \ntimes to keep my direction straight and consistent. I may be too old for \nclubbing, but I still keep pretty active, so getting over the fences wasn’t too \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 150 – Cul-de-Sac \n \n7 \n \nmuch of a problem for me, as I passed from identical road to identical garden \nover and over again. I don’t know how long I went on like this, but it felt like \nhours. At the start, I was counting how many houses I passed, but when I got \nto a hundred, I stopped. It was beginning to eat away at my careful \nrationalisations, and I couldn’t allow that. \nEventually my legs started to go, and I decided I needed some rest. I was about \nto sit on the street, when a thought occurred. I marched up to a nearby front \ndoor, prepared to kick in the flimsy-looking wood, but trying the handle \nrevealed it was unlocked. I don’t know why I picked that house. It was exactly \nidentical to all the others, and I’ve often wondered if there was anything that \ndrew me to it. Perhaps I was just unlucky, or perhaps there only ever was one \nhouse. \nThe lights worked, which was a relief, and the inside looked exactly how I \nexpected it to. And I mean, exactly how I expected it to: from the blank IKEA \nfurniture, to the subtly-patterned cream wallpaper, to the picture frames lining \nthe wall containing what were clearly stock photos, each of a different family \npantomiming a scene of domestic bliss. I headed into the living room and sat \ndown on one of the almost-comfortable armchairs. My body was aching, and \nmy eyes were heavy, and I had the thought that maybe I should head up to the \nbedroom. In the back of my mind, though, I knew that was a trap. I had \nsomehow become convinced that if I went to sleep here, then I would never \nleave. \nMy hand drifted down and brushed a plastic remote control. Almost on \ninstinct, I picked it up and turned the TV on; a cooking show, a woman I almost \nrecognised fussing over a turkey. She was talking, or at least, it sounded like \nshe was. The cadence and the sounds were so much like English that it took me \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 150 – Cul-de-Sac \n \n8 \n \nalmost a full minute to realise that she wasn’t actually saying words. She never \nlooked at the camera, and there seemed to be something wrong with her eyes, \nthough I couldn’t say what. Her hands moved over the pale skin of the turkey, \npoking it and prodding it as though preparing it, though she wasn’t actually \ndoing anything to it. Eventually, she gripped a part of it between finger and \nthumb and tore off a long strip of dry-looking meat, before tossing it over her \nshoulder and returning to her strange mimicry of cooking. \nI hit the remote again. A shopping channel. The host was a tall, clean-shaven \nman with close-cropped hair. He was holding a brick and talking about it in that \nsame flow of non-words, that still had a familiar salesman’s patter. The screen \nscrolled the message “buy now!”, though there was neither price nor contact \ndetails, as this man, who wouldn’t look at the camera, earnestly pretended to \nsell me a brick. It was almost hypnotic. I leaned back in the chair, trying to \nthink clearly about what was happening, and my eyes found themselves \nfocusing on the ceiling, on a small spot of red that seemed to have seeped \nthrough from above. \nAs I climbed those stairs, I desperately tried to tell myself I didn’t know what \nwas going to be up there. And to be fair, I was surprised by some of the details. \nBut as soon as I saw the spot, I just knew that someone else was up there and \nthat they were dead. The only questions were how and who. I think I’d given \nup on why. \nI didn’t know them, as it turned out. A young woman, conservatively dressed – \nher face was bloody, but I was sure I didn’t recognise her. She had a bag with \nher, and her ID read ‘Yetunde Uthman’ – not a name I’d ever encountered \nbefore. Just another victim of this place. It looked as though she had forced her \nhead through the mirror on", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 4, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 4500}}
