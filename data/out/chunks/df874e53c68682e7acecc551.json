A worker and an abattoir are rated on \nmany things, and one of them is how cruel or distressing they are for the \nlivestock passing through. If you’re abusive to your animals, you won’t get as \nhigh a rating, but that’s about it. You’re not going to lose your job unless you \nreally overstep the line, and sometime you have a bad day. The sort of day that \nit feels good to work out on a bit of pig flesh, as it goes towards its end. I mean, \nI wouldn’t really have said that sort of cruelty was common beyond the \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG030 – Killing Floor \n3 \n \noccasional kick or sometimes using an electric prod when it wasn’t needed. It \nwas just that, if you did see it, you didn’t care. And you knew that no-one \nwould care if they saw you do it. For all the braying and whining and \nscreaming, in the end it was all just noisy meat. \nWeirdest thing is, you start to kind of see people as meat too. Not in a food \nsort of way, you know. I don’t wanna eat my co-workers. It’s just that, when \nyou spend all day taking these living, breathing creatures – animals that move \nand cry and tremble in fear – and you turn them into lifeless blocks of dead \nflesh, it’s hard to believe in any special spark that makes us humans any \ndifferent. We run and shout and file on through our lives as simply as any cow, \nand after a while you can’t help but realise that we could turn into a lifeless \ncarcass just as easily. Easier, even, given how much smaller we are. I mean, I’m \nnot some weird killer or anything, but after a while it’s hard not to see \neveryone as moving meat. \nI used to work on the killing floor, you know? Not long. You’re not allowed to \nwork on it for long. In your whole life, I mean. I don’t know what the exact \namount of time you’re allowed to do it for is, but it’s pretty short. I only \nworked it for a few months, and now I can’t work on any killing floor \nanywhere. Ever. It’s actually a weight lifted, the knowledge you don’t have to \ndo it anymore, but you’re still there, aren’t you? It’s not like you’ve left the \nslaughterhouse. I heard once that those rules came in after they did some \nresearch in America. This must have been sixty years back now, but they \nstarted to look into the crime and murder rates of abattoir workers who \nmanned the killing floor. Of the people who’d worked the killing floor for over \nten years, do you know what percentage went on to commit murder? One \nhundred percent. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG030 – Killing Floor \n4 \n \nI don’t know if that’s true. Tony Mulholland told it to me once, when he quit \nthe place. Maybe he was just trying to mess with my head or make a point, but \nit feels right. I mean, I only did it for a few months, but you kill enough things \nthat don’t want to be killed and you start to look at person’s head and wonder \nwhere you’d need to place the bolt gun. \nI’m sorry, I know this isn’t why I’m here, I just feel like I’ve got to try and make \nyou understand what it's like, killing things and butchering their flesh for a \nliving. I mean, I don’t do it anymore, obviously. Still, you’ve got to understand \nwhere I’m coming from. \nIt all started on the killing floor. I was in charge of the bolt gun. Technically, the \nanimals we slaughter are killed by bleeding them out, something about the \nmeat quality, I think, but it’s the bolt gun that means they don’t notice. They \ncall it “stunning”, but that’s never sat quite right with me. You drive a bolt right \ninto the animal’s brain, destroying just the right part of it so that they can be \nbled without resistance, and apparently without pain. I’ve only ever done the \nstunning; I’ve never been on the bleed crew, so I guess in some ways you could \nsay I’ve never actually killed any of the animals. And sure, maybe they might \nstill have a bit of movement in them after the bolt, and maybe their heart still \nbeats, but for all they talk about “stunning” or “irreversible brain damage”, \npulling that trigger sure felt like killing to me. \nThere was another man who worked the floor, bleeding the animals. His name \nwas Tom Haan, and I had never really spoke to him. For the longest time I \nwasn’t even sure how much English he spoke – he was from China, I think, and \nhardly ever said a word. The first time I really heard his voice was that day, the \nday it all", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 1, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 4499}}
