It was hard to tell \nmuch about them as they were mostly in the shadows, though if I’d had to \nguess I would have said the voice sounded male. They seemed to sway, ever so \nslightly, as I watched, and I assumed that they, like me, were probably a little \nbit drunk. I lit my own cigarette and held out my tobacco towards them, \nthough I didn’t approach, and asked if they were ok with a roll-up. The figure \ndidn’t move except to continue that gentle swaying. Writing it down now, it \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG001 – Anglerfish \n6 \n \nseems so obvious that something was wrong. If I hadn’t been so drunk maybe \nI’d have noticed quicker, but even when the stranger asked the question again, \n“Can I have a cigarette?” utterly without intonation, still I didn’t understand \nwhy I was so uneasy. I stared at the stranger and as my eyes began to adjust I \ncould make out more details. I could see that their face appeared blank, \nexpressionless, and their skin seemed damp and slightly sunken, like they had a \nbad fever. The swaying was more pronounced now, seeming to move from the \nwaist, side to side, back and forth. \nBy this point I had finished rolling a second cigarette and gingerly held it out \ntowards them, but I didn’t get any closer. I had decided that if this weirdo \nwanted a cigarette, they were going to need to come out of the creepy \nalleyway. They didn’t come closer, didn’t make any movement at all except for \nthat damn swaying. For some reason the thought of an anglerfish popped into \nmy head, the single point of light dangled into the darkness, hiding the thing \nthat lures you in. “Can I have a cigarette?” It spoke again in the same flat voice \nand I realised exactly what was wrong. Its mouth was closed, had been the \nwhole time. Whatever was repeating that question, it wasn’t the figure in the \nalleyway. I looked at their feet and saw that they weren’t quite touching the \nground. The stranger’s form was being lifted, ever so slightly, and moved \ngently from side to side. \nI dropped the cigarette and grabbed for my phone, trying to turn on the torch. \nI don’t know why I didn’t run or what I hoped to see in that alley, but I wanted \nto get a better look. As soon as I took out my phone, the figure disappeared. It \nsort of folded at the waist and vanished back into the darkness, as if a string \nhad gone taut and pulled it back. I turned on the torch and stared into the \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG001 – Anglerfish \n7 \n \nalley, but I saw nothing. Just silence and darkness. I staggered back up to the \nRoyal Mile, which still had lights and people, and found a taxi to take me home. \nI slept late the next day. I’d made sure I didn’t have any lectures or classes, as I \nhad intended to be sleeping off a heavy night of drinking, which I guess I was, \nalthough it was that bizarre encounter that kept playing in my mind. And so, \nafter making my way through two litres of water, some painkillers and a very \ngreasy breakfast, I felt human enough to leave my flat and go to investigate the \nplace in daylight. The result was unenlightening. There were no marks, no \nbloodstains, nothing to indicate that the swaying figure had ever been there at \nall. The only thing I did find was an unsmoked Marlboro Red cigarette, lying \njust below the burned out light fixture. Beyond that, I didn’t really know what \nto do. \nI did as much research as I could on the place, but couldn’t find anyone who’d \nhad any experience similar to mine, and there didn’t seem to be any folklore or \nurban legends I could find out about Old Fishmarket Close. \nThe few friends I told about what happened just assumed I’d been accosted by \nsome stranger and the alcohol had made it seem much weirder than it was. I \ntried to explain that I’ve never had hallucinations while drunk, and that there \nwas no way this guy had just been a normal person, but they always gave me \none of those looks, halfway between pity and concern, and I’d shut up. \nI never did find out anything else about it, but a few days later I saw some \nmissing person appeals go up around campus.
