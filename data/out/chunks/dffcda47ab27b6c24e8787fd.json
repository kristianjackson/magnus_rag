I used to assume this was to protect us from drunks and \nweirdos who ate the wrong kind of mushroom. I don’t think that’s it, though. I \nthink it’s to protect us from the stuff that might be real. Make sure we only go \nlooking after encounters that others have already confirmed as safe. I mean, I \ndon’t know what it was about Sarah Baldwin that mixed so badly with the \npresence in the CMH, but that was the first I’d ever heard of a significant \nencounter there. Somewhere, somehow, the community had deemed it as not \ndangerous. Asbestos notwithstanding. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG076 – The Smell of Blood \n4 \n \nSo, the more I looked, the more I realised that there was this huge list of places \nthat my colleagues steered completely clear of without even realising it, and a \nhandful of stories to go with them. It wasn’t much, but it was a start. \nEven back then, I could feel all my old friends starting to distance themselves \nfrom me. Like they sensed I was crossing some unspoken line about what we \nwere allowed to investigate. Everyone had a story about the friend who’d gone \nto the wrong place alone and disappeared or had quit the paranormal scene \nwithout explanation. I’d heard them all before, but now they weren’t just pub \nchatter spook stories, they were not-so-subtle warnings about straying from \nthe path. I couldn’t go back, though. It was like once I had seen that there was \na path to stray from, I couldn’t unsee it. And I couldn’t ignore the call from the \nwoods all around. I stopped asking the others for help, and I kept my research \nto myself. I talked to them less and less. \nBy the time I was arrested, I think a lot of them had already given up on me. I’d \nbeen looking into a bunch of online stuff, the forums and the sites without the \nright sort of reputation for most of my lot. The sort of places with twenty \nmade-up ghost stories for every one that might have some meat to it. After a \nwhile, you start to get a feel for the ones that are real or, at least, that the \nwriter thinks are real. They tend to be the messy ones. The ones that don’t \nreally have any sense or resolution, no narrative flow. Where there isn’t even a \nguess at an explanation, and often you end up just thinking, “Is that it?” \nThere was one, though, that caught my eye. It was some anonymous worker at \nthe C.F. Booth scrap metal and recycling yard. If you haven’t heard of it, it’s in \nRotherham, and it’s one of the biggest train graveyards in the UK. The guy said \nhe worked there scrapping train, but there was one metal rail car that had \nbeen there since he got the job, and it never seemed to be on the queue for", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 1, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 2780}}
