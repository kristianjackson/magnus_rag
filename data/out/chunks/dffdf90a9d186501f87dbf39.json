I remember as a kid my parents used to \ntake us on trips to this small cabin in Wales. I was very young at the time, \nmaybe four or five, and the cabin wasn’t anything special, just cheap self-\ncatering. It was all the holiday that my parents could afford and I had to share \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG048 – Lost in The Crowd \n2 \n \na bunkbed with my brat of an older brother, but I remember that every time \nwe drove across that huge bridge from England into Wales, I got this rush of \ndiscovery, of exploration. Seeing new places; going further; travelling. I’ve \nnever looked back since. \n \nAs I said, my parents didn’t have much money, so the first chance I really had \nto go beyond the UK was when I took a gap year. I’d saved for years to afford \nthat trip, helped by an inheritance from a distant grandmother, and I bought a \nbunch of Interrail train tickets and spent almost four months rolling across \nEurope, never staying more than a few days in any one place and heading on \nas soon as I got bored. There were nights that I was unable to find a hostel and \nended up having to sleep on the streets and I even slept in a graveyard once. \nI’d pick up travelling companions for a few days here and there, but for the \nmost part I would spend weeks without speaking my own language. I had \nadventures and saw wonders and got into more than a bit of trouble on \noccasion. It was the happiest I’d ever been. \n \nSince then, travel has always been my main joy in life. I got out of university \nwith a good maths degree and got a job as a programmer. It’s a life of well-paid \ndrudgery, but I don’t care, because it means once or twice a year I can drop \neverything for a month and disappear somewhere new: the Grand Canyon, the \nForbidden City, the Great Barrier Reef. That’s my life. Everything in between is \njust the intermission. I suppose that’s one of the reasons I’ve always had such \ntrouble with romance, or even close friendships. I can never take them \nseriously, because they aren’t a part of my real life. And in my real life, I travel \nalone.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 0, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 2893}}
