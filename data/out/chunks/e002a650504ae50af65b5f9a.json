(small chuckle) zombies. Original statement given 1st February \n2015. Recording by Jonathan Sims, the Archivist. \nStatement begins. \n \nARCHIVIST (STATEMENT) \nPeople always used to tell me I was solipsistic. They said that I never really \nengaged with other people, never acted like they really existed or mattered, at \nleast not in the same way that I did. And I suppose in many ways they were \nright. It’s hard to explain without sounding stupid. Obviously other people are \nreal, obviously the, the way a building is real or my watch is real. They exist. If \npeople weren’t real, I’m, I’m sure I would find them much less of a chore. So \nno, I don’t “not believe in other people”. \nI just find it very difficult to feel for others. I can’t understand them and they’ve \nalways seemed... Well, there’s no tactful way to say it, they’ve always just \nseemed a little bit pointless. I know what my pain feels like, and I know what \nmy joy feels like, but when I see those same things on the faces of my friends \nor my enemies, I feel... \nWell, that’s it, isn’t it? I don’t really feel anything. Their emotions and suffering \nfeel as distant to me as a character on a movie screen. More distant, really. In \nmany ways, I find those crude caricatures that wander through ridiculous plot \nafter ridiculous plot more relatable than the people watching next to me. That \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 122 – Zombie \n \n12 \n \nsaid, Danielle did tell me once that films tend to depict characters like that so \nit’s easier to project yourself onto them, so maybe it isn’t quite as surprising as \nall that. \nI like animals, too. They don’t pretend to be important. \nSo, assuming you can understand anything, I would hope that you could \nunderstand why the philosophical concept of ‘zombies’ might worm its way \ninto my mind. Danielle studies philosophy. Well, she studied philosophy, and \nshe was one of those people who loved to talk to others about it, try to explain \nit, as a way of internalising the information. So, come exam season, her \nfavourite revision method was to try and explain a year’s worth of dusty old \nwhite men thinking about existence to me. She said it really helped and, well, \nsometimes I didn’t have anything better to do. \nIt never stuck, of course. It’s all kind of rubbish, really, people trying to think \nthe universe into making sense, coming up with all sorts of nonsense and \ntrying to claim that because they can imagine it, it must be true. I-I’m grossly \noversimplifying, of course, but I don’t care. I don’t think Danielle did very well \nin her exams. \nI remember the night she told me about zombies. It was dark outside and must \nhave been late. It was high summer, and the days were long and sweltering. \nOur building really kept the heat and had very few opening windows, so even \nin the evening that humid warmth seemed to stick around. One of our \nhousemates, Liam, was sat at the other end of the living room, playing some \nobnoxious videogame. He had the lights at that end of the room turned off, \nand the screen lit up his blank, gormless face as he stared at some space \nmonster or other that he had to kill.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 1, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 3984}}
