Let’s try one of those analogies Peter finds so annoying. Erm… imagine \nyou are deaf, but every night you hear the most beautiful music in your dreams, \nand your every waking thought is consumed by trying to reproduce that music. \n(Oh, you’re mute as well in this analogy, or at least you can’t sing.) And you need \nto invent the idea of a musical instrument from scratch. Everyone else is also deaf \nand mute, and -- \nMARTIN \nYes, I think I get it. \nSIMON \nYes, well the point is, most of us are trying so desperately to recreate our own \ndream symphony that we bring an awful lot of our own baggage into the mix. \nMARTIN \nWhat about the monsters? \nSIMON \nWhat monsters? \nMARTIN \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 151 – Big Picture \n14 \n \nThings like M-- erm, uh, the Distortion. I thought they were part of the entities \nthemselves, extensions. Surely they know what’s going on. \nSIMON \nHonestly, I think they have it a lot worse than we do. Imagine being a hand that \ncan conceive of itself, having impulses shot through you, being moved and \nclinched by some unseen mind, but never knowing the reasoning behind your \nown actions, or even if you’re just some thoughtless reflex. (Noise of disgust) \nSounds horrid. \nMARTIN \n(Agitated) So if no one’s ever actually communicated with their patron, how do \nyou know they even want rituals? How - how does anyone know if they could \never even work? \nSIMON \nWe don’t! \n(Martin scoffs.) \nSIMON \nAnd honestly? The idea that this is all some grand cosmic joke, thousands of us \nrunning around spreading horror and sabotaging each other pointlessly while \nthese impossible unknowable things just lurk out there, feeding off the misery we \ncaused? I find that interpretation quite appealing. But, I still hear the music in my \ndreams. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 151 – Big Picture \n15 \n \n(Martin makes a sound of acknowledgement. There’s a pause.) \nMARTIN \nWho are you? No, no - who were you? \nSIMON \nOriginally? No one you would have heard of. No great historical figure or atrocity \nmonger. I’ve been Simon Fairchild about, erm, 80 or 90 years maybe. For business \npurposes mainly, by which I mean I was bored at not being wealthy, so I made \nsome arrangements and sent Mr. Fairchild on a very long fall. I could go into \ndetails but without a certain amount of knowledge of 1930s tax practices it \nwouldn’t mean very much to you. \nMARTIN \nAnd how did you get started with it all? Did you -- did - did you just look up at the \nsky one day and fall head-over-heels in love? \nSIMON \nSort of, actually. Except it wasn’t the actual sky, it was a painting. I was \napprenticed, you see, under Tintoretto. Dreadful man, but a decent artist. He was \nfascinated, you see, with the human figure. He found most of the rest of the work \ndreadfully dull so he’d always delegated the lot of it to us. \nHe had a particular distaste for painting the sky, and I was always the one he \ncalled on to do them. Days, weeks I would spend, focusing so intently on these \npatches of clear sky or swirling cloud at the top of his latest self-proclaimed \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 151 – Big Picture \n16 \n \nmasterpiece, and gradually it sort of, erm, drew me in until it seemed to dwarf the \nrest of the work. Every stroke of the brush felt larger than my entire existence. \nAnd when I finally lost my footing, well…. I should have of course fallen to the \nfloor of the church, broken my neck, but that blue painted sky welcomed me with \nopen arms and I never looked back. \nI tried to share it with others, not just as sacrifices, but they often find it difficult \nto keep up with the, um, velocity I tend to live at. They tend to get left behind, \nand I suppose it doesn’t help that I can’t bring myself to see any of them as \nanything other than trivial. \nMARTIN \nMm. \nSIMON \nNo wonder I’m so sympathetic to the Lonely! You know, this really is a place for \nself-discovery, isn’t it? (Chuckles) Statement ends I suppose. \nMARTIN \nEr, I’m sorry? \nSIMON \nOh nothing, just my own hubris. I should have known. When I came here, I said to \nmyself, “Simon,” I said, “you’re going to answer this young man’s questions, but \nyou’re not going to give the Watcher a statement. You’re better than that.” But", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 3, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 4215}}
