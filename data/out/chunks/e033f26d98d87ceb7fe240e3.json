Tape clicks on.] \nSupplemental. \nBooks. Again and again it always seems to come back to those books. There are \nother artifacts that hold sinister power, certainly, but none of them seem to be \nquite so prevalent or insidious as those damn books. But why? I had always \nassumed that Leitner had created them somehow, leasing parts of his own \ndamned soul give them power, or some similar nonsense. But no. I’ve heard \n\nenough now to be sure that these books existed long before he managed to \nhunt them down. Not all of them, though, it would seem. \nI found something in the tunnels. I have now thoroughly explored the upper \nlevel, at least as far as I’m able. Further in, some of the passageways are \nblocked off or ruined by infrastructure works. Pipes and drainage, that sort of \nthing. It may be that the lower levels would have a route underneath and back \nup the other side, though I’ve yet to make much headway down there. But, \nshortly after I started exploring the second level, I found something. It was a \nroom, empty except for three wooden chairs. It looked like there had \npreviously been more, but they had been smashed. Based on the scorch marks \nin the corner, I think I know what they were used for. The ashes were old, \nimpossible to tell what they might have been before they were burned, except \nfor the small scraps of old paper dotted around the floor. I think someone tore \nup a book and then burned it. There was only one scrap large enough to \ndecipher anything legible: “They have for adversaries the Satariel, or \nconcealers, the Demons of absurdity, of intellectual inertia, and of Mystery.” \nThat answers the question of what happened to the copy of The Key of \nSolomon that Gertrude bought. But if she only bought it to destroy it, why \ndown there? There seemed no especial significance to the room, except that it \ncontained some old wooden furniture. No sign of the other Leitners, though. \nI’ll need to keep looking. \nEnd supplemental. \n[The Magnus Archives Theme - Outro] \n \n\nThe Magnus Archives is a podcast distributed by Rusty Quill and licensed under \na creative commons attribution, non-commercial share alike 4.0 international \nlicense.
