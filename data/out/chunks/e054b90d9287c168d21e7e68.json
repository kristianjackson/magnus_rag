Apparently so. \nShe studied the face of ‘Elias Bouchard’. He seemed far too young for the role \nhe had apparently found himself in, with an old-fashioned haircut that seemed \nto accentuate the image rather than lessen it. How was he already the head of \nan academic institution? No doubt mummy and daddy had something to do \nwith it... The thought leapt across Rosie’s mind before she could stop it, and \nwith no small amount of bitterness. \nHis eyes, though, were different. There was something in them that unsettled \nher. They didn’t match the rest of his face. They were cold and grey, and \nsomehow so much older. \n[Paper sliding and pen click] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 192 – An Appointment \n \n17 \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \n“So why do you want this job, Ms Zampano?” \n‘Because I need money to live, you pompous ass,’ she didn’t answer. ‘Because I \nlet my imagination and paranoia wreck my marriage, and now I’ve got nothing. \nAnd if I don’t get a job, I’m just sitting around an empty flat staring into space.’ \nInstead she smiled. \n“I guess I’m just curious to know what goes on in a place like this.” \n[Intercom switch clicks with Panopticon reverb] \n[Office sounds cease; replaced by the distant, muffled sounds of \ncurrent-day London: helicopters and a crowd screaming] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nFrom up here she can see all of it at such a distance. She can hear the distant \nscreams, spot the occasional gout of blood, smell the burning flesh wafting \nfrom far below when the wind is right. Should she be doing something? Her \nhand hovers over the intercom. Mr Bouchard isn’t to be disturbed; Rosie is \ncertain of that, but what else could she do? She chokes down her unease and \nsmiles again, just in case anyone might be watching. \n[Intercom switch clicks with office reverb] \n[Current-day London sounds stop; replaced by office sounds such as \na photocopier running and people typing] \n[Faint Hissing static starts] \n[Heavy feet on shift nearby] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 192 – An Appointment \n \n18 \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nThey weren’t actually Cockney, she knew that for certain. They might as well \nhave been asking to take that table up the ‘apples and pears’. Some kind of \npractical joke being played on her? She said nothing, though she glanced \naround in case anyone was watching from a distance, snickering. The pair of \nthem loomed over her with identical expressions on their identical faces. \nExpressions of gruff impatience. \nRosie looked over the delivery form. \n[Paper rustles] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \n‘Jonathan Sims’, the name read. She knew him. Well, knew of him, the things \nthey said about him in the break room, the sort of things that passed across Mr \nBouchard’s desk about him. She hadn’t been snooping, exactly, but maybe a \nlittle bit curious. Rosie had liked Gertrude, Sims’ predecessor. The old woman \nhad always talked to her as though she was in on something, even though \nRosie had never understood half the things she had told her. Sims was \ndifferent. He was insecure, aggressive, desperate to be taken seriously. Of \ncourse, having seen his file, Rosie kind of understood. Why on earth Mr \nBouchard had given him the job at all was a mystery to her, but it didn’t make \nit any easier to talk to him. \nHe was in the building, and she really should have called down, gotten him to \ncome up and sign off on the delivery. But if he dragged his feet, that would \nhave left her here with these two weird impressionists. And no doubt when he \nfinally did arrive there’d be some drama or other. No, she’d just sign for it, and \npass it on to Martin. He’d get it sorted out.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 3, "chunk_count": 9, "chars": 3649}}
