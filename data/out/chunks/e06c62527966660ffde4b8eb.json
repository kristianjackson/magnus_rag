Then they began to make \nappointments and send me to specialists. \nI was tested and poked and quizzed and prodded all through my teenage years. \nI never believed I was delusional, not like that, no matter what my father said. \nAnd neither, it seemed, did the doctors. At least, not in any way they could \nprove. Every test, every examination, seemed to reinforce the fact that there \nwas nothing medically unusual about me or my mind. The only evidence to the \ncontrary was the fact that I kept seeing the door. \nWhen I was thirteen, it was underneath a railway bridge. It was huge and \nmetal this time, with solid iron bolts sealing it shut and a thick chain stretched \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 146 – Threshold \n \n6 \n \nacross it. The warning stickers had long since peeled off, and someone had \nscrawled in chalk: ‘Warning: Danger of death.’ As I passed, something heavy \nbegan to bang on the other side, sending the chain dancing. It pounded again \nand again, and I didn’t know if it was trying to force its way out, or politely \nknocking, hoping to be let in. \nWhen I was fifteen, I pressed the doorbell to Sandra’s house, picking her up for \nour first date, and I realised that it sounded wrong, like the doorbell was \nechoing through a hundred empty corridors, bouncing back and forth and \nlingering in the air. I looked again at their front door and realised it didn’t lead \nto their house. I heard footsteps approaching on the other side from the far \ndistance, fast and steady but getting closer. I turned and ran just as I heard the \ndoor open behind me. \nWhen I was sixteen, I was stumbling home drunk from a house party and I \nfound it lying open in the ground in front of me. It was wide, waiting, and I \ncould see a long corridor stretching down and away, at a right angle to the \nworld as I knew it, turning off into an angular labyrinth. I was trying so hard to \nwalk carefully, to seem like I wasn’t drunk, that I almost didn’t notice it until it \nwas too late. I stared into it for a long time, my eyes hazy from cheap vodka, \nand I saw a shape walking calmly along the vertical floor. \nWhen I was eighteen, I was driving a group of friends to a concert in Leeds, \nwhen we pulled into a service station to get some lunch. They didn’t hear the \nscream coming from the small stone structure just next to where all the \ncoaches parked. They didn’t see the drag marks that led across the tarmac and \nunder the door. I didn’t eat lunch that day. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 146 – Threshold \n \n7 \n \nThe last time was the worst. It hadn’t happened for almost fifteen years and \nwhen I saw it I almost wept. It was when I was living in Oxford, up Cowley way. \nA few streets over, there was an empty plot of land, just scrubby plants and \njunk. If there’d ever been a house there, it was long gone. A few of the older \nresidents said it burned down in the seventies, but they were always real weird \nabout it. I passed it whenever I was heading down to get a drink at the City \nArms. \nThe last week before I had to move back in with my parents, I was at my lowest \npoint. I was bankrupt in all but name, the work of almost half a decade flushed \ndown the toilet, and all that remained of my worldly possessions were packed \nup for yet another return to childhood. And as I passed that empty space of \ngrass, there it was: a pale-yellow door, stood all alone, like the entrance to a \nhouse that I just couldn’t see. It had no frame around it, but I was sure that if I \ngrasped its handle and twisted, it would still swing open, silent and inviting. \nThis wasn’t like before. There was no playfulness here, none of that malicious \njoy that I had always felt coming off it. Now there was just a cold hunger, a \ndeep anger, as though I had no right to just stand there looking at it. The street \nwas silent, but I could feel it screaming at me to open it. I just about managed \nnot to. I was just about able to walk away. \nI’m sorry, I didn’t mean to get so deep into my own issues. I’m not mad, I know \nthat, it’s just this door is something else, and my father knows that. It’s why he \nused it as a cornerstone of his little story, but it’s just pretend. He just wants \nme to move back in with him, and I can’t. I just can’t. Sometimes, you just have \nto leave, even if what’s on the other side scares you.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 3, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 4336}}
