Couldn’t have been him. He was so scared \nof me, I just… just let him go. \nARCHIVIST \nAre you alright? \nGERARD \n\nI think... I think I’m ready to go. I’m done. Hide my page, and when you’re out \nof here, burn it. Please. \nARCHIVIST \nI will. Thank you, Gerard. \nGERARD \nGerry. \nARCHIVIST \nWhat? \nGERRY \nGerard was what my mum called me. (Embarrassed laugh) I always wanted my \nfriends to call me Gerry. \nARCHIVIST \nThank you, Gerry. Uh... I dismiss you. \n(Gerry sighs.) \n[There’s static as he fades.] \nOh. Alright \n[The book is closed.] \n(The Archivist clears his throat.) \nI’m ready! \n[Footsteps and a door opens] \nTREVOR \nAll done? \nARCHIVIST \nI… Yeah. I-I think so. \n\nTREVOR \nI’ll get it back in the box. \n[Footsteps] \nJULIA \nDid he tell you what you needed? \nARCHIVIST \nI don’t— Maybe.

Stopping that… The Unknowing? \nARCHIVIST \n\nOh, er, I think so. I hope so. \n[Liquid sounds] \nJULIA \nSo what’s our next move? \n[Footsteps] \nARCHIVIST \nWell, mine’s a flight back to London. I-I-I think you said that would be a \nproblem for you, you two? \nJULIA \nYeah. To be honest, if this thing is as soon as you think it’s gonna be, and back \nin England? Well, I’m not sure how much ‘elp we can be. \nARCHIVIST \nYou’ve already done... so much more than enough. \nJULIA \nYeah well, you brought us Max Mustermann’s head. I think we’re going to have \na lot fun with that. Plus, if you do save the world... \nARCHIVIST \nI suppose we’ll call it even. \nJULIA \nMore or less. \nARCHIVIST \nThank you, Julia. I mean it. \nJULIA \nWell, it’s just killing monsters really, isn’t it? \n\nARCHIVIST \nHow about that drink? \n[Tape clicks off.] \n[The Magnus Archives Theme – Outro] \nJONATHAN SIMS \nThe Magnus Archives is a podcast distributed by Rusty Quill and licenced under \na Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Sharealike 4.0 International \nLicense.
