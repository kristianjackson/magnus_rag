They did send me one, you know. Oh, it was dreadful. I couldn’t sleep on \nit. I managed three days before my back gave out. I’ve still got it somewhere in \nthe guest room, if the other one’s not up to your exacting standards. \nARCHIVIST \nOoh… I think I’m alright. I was going to make a cup of tea if you want one? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG081 – A Guest for Mr Spider \n13 \n \nGEORGIE \nMaybe later, I’ve got recording of my own to do. \nARCHIVIST \nRight you are. I’ll… I’ll keep quiet. \nGEORGIE \nI wouldn’t worry too much. The studio’s pretty well soundproofed. \nARCHIVIST \nWhat’s this one about? \nGEORGIE \nOh, I’m trying to find some new angle on the Ancient Ram Inn. \nARCHIVIST \nI thought there’d already been a What the Ghost on that? \nGEORGIE \nNo. No, you’re thinking of every other hacky, ghost podcast. But, you know, if it \nsells a few T-shirts…. \nARCHIVIST \nOh, I, yes, I meant to say, actually, thank you for – \nGEORGIE \nOh, it’s fine. Though I don’t know what sort of “employment dispute” leaves \nyou without a change of clothes. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG081 – A Guest for Mr Spider \n14 \n \nARCHIVIST \nYou wouldn’t believe me. \nGEORGIE \nDo you even listen to my podcast? I’ll believe anything. But, on air. \nARCHIVIST \nI will tell you, Georgie, I… I just… \nGEORGIE \nIt’s alright. There’s no rush. I mean, it was clearly pretty bad, so only when \nyou’re ready. If you’re ready. \nARCHIVIST \nThanks. I… Thank you. \nGEORGIE \nSure. Anyway, I got recording to be doing. Catch you after. \nARCHIVIST \nYeah. \n[Georgie leaves. The Archivist exhales.
