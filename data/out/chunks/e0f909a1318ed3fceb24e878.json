I couldn’t see any obvious signs of previous slaughter, but I \nremembered how cleanly Sylvia McDonald had sucked up all the blood from \nmy brother, so this did not strike me as odd. I gently tried the window and \nfound it locked, so searched the garden for the heaviest stone I could find and \nwatched what was happening inside. I had to be sure. Soon enough Robert \nArden moved smoothly behind its now-seated prey, and finally opened its \nmouth to reveal those rows of shark-like teeth I knew would be there. I hurled \nthe rock I held through the window, showering the room with broken glass and \ncausing the woman to scream in shock. Robert Arden raised its head in surprise \nand for one moment our eyes locked and I knew I had made a terrible mistake. \nThe woman looked at her monstrous companion and, seeing his now open \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG010 – Vampire Killer \n11 \n \nmouth, screamed her terror even louder. In a single movement, far quicker \nthan I expected, Robert Arden was through the window and on me. I struggled \nand fought, but it was far stronger than I was, and I could barely keep its \njagged teeth from finding my throat. It was the first and last time I ever \ntouched a vampire’s skin with my own. The flesh was cold and spongy, like the \ninside of a bruised apple, and I felt bile rise in my throat even as I fought for my \nlife. \nFinally, its teeth bit into my neck. Not enough to kill me outright but with \nenough force to cause the blood to flow. At that moment I saw a sort of frenzy \nenter the eyes of Robert Arden and with a spasm its leech’s tongue surged \nfrom its throat and I felt it attach to my neck. I do not know if you’ve ever felt \nyour blood being sucked out of you, but I would not recommend it. \nNow it is at this point I have something of an admission to make. For the three \nyears preceding this event, as well as on and off through the years since, I have \nhad a relationship with the drug heroin. I tried it for the first time shortly after \nNigel’s death and since then I have periodically relapsed. I have always tried to \nkeep this a secret, as I am aware that I have a certain reputation to uphold and \nI would not want it to be damaged with the revealing of my addiction. But it is \nimportant to this account, as I believe it was whatever heroin still remained in \nmy system that night that caused the vampire Robert Arden to remove its \ntongue from my neck and start to shake, as though having a violent choking fit. \nI lay there, trying to compose myself enough to fight back, when I became \naware of the screaming. The woman, who had been brought in as a victim, was \nstanding over the flailing Robert Arden, stabbing it repeatedly with a kitchen \nknife. Strong and quick as it was, the vampire didn’t seem to be able to cope \nwith the sudden onslaught of violence and was on the ground.
