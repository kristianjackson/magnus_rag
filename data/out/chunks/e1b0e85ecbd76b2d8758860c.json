You see, \nDexter Banks lived movies. As far as I could tell, every single aspect of his life \nhad revolved around them. His dad had owned a small cinema near Fairfax \nAvenue and as a teenager he’d bounced between working there and a small \nrental store that specialised in foreign films, specifically Italian horror movies \nand East Asian martial arts. I never met anyone who knew as much about films, \nand as little about anything else. \n \nWorking with him, it soon became clear that all he was interested in doing was \nrecreating things he had seen. Taking scenes and music that he loved from \nthose old obscure corners of cinema, and then constructing whatever \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG110 – Creature Feature \n \n3 \n \npatchwork narrative would allow him to shoot his own versions of them. \nWhatever dialogue he didn’t repurpose and had to write himself was stilted \nand slow, trying to mirror the stylisation that surrounded it, but failing utterly. I \nonce mentioned to him the idea of working with a writer. I didn’t do it again. \n \nRed Ronin, for instance, was based on a Japanese film from the early seventies \ncalled Blade of the Avenger. It hit on the same dynamics and scenes as the \noriginal, but was set in modern-day Arizona, following a nihilistic ex-Marine in \nthe fictional town of Funnel. It wasn’t strictly a remake though because Dexter \nwould constantly call me into the screening room to show me some other \nsamurai or western that I’d never heard of, before jumping up at the \nappropriate scene and shouting, “That was it! We do that!” And I did. \n \nI’m very good at my job. I’ve been doing it almost thirty years now, five at the \nBBC before crossing the Atlantic, and I know exactly what I’m doing. It turned \nout that I have a talent for capturing the feeling of older movies, mirroring \nthem while still keeping the shots fresh. Who cares if it bored me to creative \ntears? It was exactly the sort of bull that critics love, and Red Ronin was the \nfirst of Dexter’s films to get an Oscar nomination, though it ended up losing out \nto The English Patient. Not really surprising; it was too genre for the Academy. \n \nI didn’t realise it, but by that point I was already locked in with Dexter. I’d held \nsome ambitions about directing myself one day, but it soon became obvious \nthat it wasn’t going to happen. Maybe if I’d got a feature under my belt before \nI was outed as trans it might have been different, but as it was, that revelation \nburned too many bridges and, when the dust settled, it was made abundantly \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG110 – Creature Feature \n \n4 \n \nclear to me that I was never going to get a movie of my own, and it was either \ncinematography or nothing. So, I stayed. \n \nI was in a bad place for the next couple of years, and blindly accepted the DOP \npositions on two more of Dexter’s films, Hell’s Company and Leroy Slake. Both \nwere big hits, and by the time I properly felt myself again, I had ended up with \nmy career so tied up in Dexter’s that chasing other gigs wasn’t really an option. \nI still have no idea how intentional it was on his part, but he was definitely \naware that it was my work that elevated his films above simple homage. His \nperiodic bouts of petty jealousy and snide bitterness had made that \nabundantly clear. Five years and three movies in, it was clear that we needed \neach other almost as much as we hated each other. \n \nI don’t know when he first mentioned his spider film. It didn’t bubble out into a \nfull obsession until two years ago, but I know he’d talked about it plenty before \nthat. Whenever arguments over a project would last late into the night, and if \nhe was very drunk, he’d get kind of quiet, and then he’d ask me, yet again, if I’d \never seen Kumo Ga Tabete Iru. I think that was the name, anyway, something \nlike that. He was normally slurring quite badly when he said it. He thought it \ntranslated to “The Spiders that Devour”, but a Japanese friend once told me it \nwas closer to just “spiders are eating”. \n \nAccording to Dexter, Kumo was an old Tokusatsu movie which he believed had \ncome out some time in the mid-to-late sixties. It was about a spider, just the \none, despite the title, that grew to a colossal size and terrorised a small \nunnamed island off the coast of Kagoshima. What struck him about it, though, \nwas the utter absence of anything resembling a hero or protagonist. No-one", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 1, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 4437}}
