And \neveryone called her Sasha as well, which… I didn’t think it was too strange. I \nmean, i-i-it’s a common name, but everyone kept saying they were the same \nperson and, and they weren’t. At all! John kept saying there’d only ever been \none Sasha working there, but they were totally different. And everyone’s been \ngiving me really strange looks whenever I talk about it. \nTIM \nWhat did she look like? \nMELANIE \nWhat? Sorry? \nTIM \nThe first Sasha. What… What was she like? \nMELANIE \nUh, she was… um… I don’t, er… maybe I’m… I’m getting it wrong. I just… okay, I \ncan’t, er – \nTIM \nNo. I… think I understand. \nMELANIE \nWell, can you explain? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG086 – Tucked In \n6 \n \nTIM \nWho am I even sad for? \nMELANIE \nI… I’m, I’m sorry… I don’t, er… \nTIM \nUm… I’m, I’m going to lie down. Um. Can you record this for me? \nIt’s part of your job now, I guess. The tape’s already running. \nMELANIE \nSure. Sure thing. \n[Tim leaves, the door opening and closing] \nMELANIE \nUh, right. Benjamin Hatendi’s account of… oh for… a, a strange encounter. Er, \nstatement date, March 2nd, 1983. Melanie King recording. Apparently. \nSo, uh… marker! (Melanie claps) Right. Here we go. Er… \nMELANIE (STATEMENT) \nMy parents never let me have a night light. I was always afraid, but they were \njust that sort of stubborn which doubled down when I screamed or cried about \nsomething, instead of actually listening. So no matter how terrified I might \nhave been, I would always end up sleeping in the dark. \nI don’t know why it was such a cornerstone of their vision to see me grow up \nstrong, but even an adult they would tell me how they “helped me get over my \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG086 – Tucked In \n7 \n \nfear of the dark”. It was such a point of pride for them that I could never bring \nmyself to tell them, to say that the fear never really went away. I’ve heard that \nbeing exposed to the source of your terror over and over again can help break \nits power over you, numb you to it, but in my experience it just teaches you to \nhide from it. Sometimes that might mean hiding in a quiet corner of your mind, \nbut sometimes it’s literally a blanket. \nIt wasn’t a specific blanket, either. I didn’t have it from childhood, or carry it \nfor security; it was just whatever was on my bed. Thin summer sheet or thick \nduvet, it didn’t matter, as long as I could duck my head underneath it and curl \ninto a ball, I was fine. Weirdly, the fact it was still pitch black when I was \nunderneath those covers didn’t bother me a bit. The darkness beneath the \nblankets was my darkness: it was warm and cosy. I trusted it. But that cold, \nhateful gloom waiting just beyond the thin wall of my sanctuary never really \nleft my mind. \nEventually I grew up, like pretty much everyone, and as the years passed I \nforgot my childhood fear. The blanket was just there to keep me warm. Until \nlast week. \nThe mother of an old friend of mine, Robin Patton, called me out of the blue. \nNow, at that point I hadn’t really seen Robin in about three years, but she \nsounded close to panic so I listened. She told me she hadn’t heard from him in \nalmost a month, and was convinced something terrible had happened to her \nson. Apparently he lived alone, and I was the closest friend to Robin’s address. \nShe begged me to go over, and see if anything was wrong. \nI feel a bit guilty about how long I put off going, although in the end I guess it \ndidn’t matter.
