To say it hurts is the least of its horrors. That \nthing will come for me again tonight, I know it will, and there is nothing that \ncan protect me. I just thought sharing my story might help some other poor \nidiot in the future. \nI miss my blanket. Hiding was always so much easier. \nMELANIE \n(Melanie claps again) Marker. \nUh, statement ends. \nWell, er, that was… I suppose this is what I do now. Um… there, there aren’t \nany photos in the file, er, certainly not of weird supernatural injuries. There’s a \nphotocopy of a death certificate for Benjamin Hatendi – looks like Martin has \nhighlighted the cause of death. Says “Unknown – possible biological agent. All \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG086 – Tucked In \n14 \n \nsamples incinerated”. It’s dated as March 7th 1983, five days after this \nstatement. \nThen there are some old cuttings about Robin Patton. Profiles from \nmagazines… um… Oh, he must have been quite something in the hiking \ncommunity. Ah, apparently he wrote a book. Something about the best natural \npools and lakes for swimming. Yeah, mostly just background fluff, and pictures \nof the guy emerging topless from waterfalls. Hmm, wasn’t bad-looking, \nbefore… well… that. \nEr, anyway, er, doesn’t look relevant. \nI, I suppose that’s it. Er, the only other thing in there is… a sealed Ziploc bag \ncontaining an old fabric tag. Fantastic. Looks like it might be from a mattress or \na duvet, maybe. It’s, uh, it’s got some rather pronounced dark stains on the \nend. It’s probably nonsense. It’s all probably nonsense. But I’m going to keep it \nsealed. \nUh… I suppose… that’s a wrap. \n[Tape clicks on. Tape clicks off. The scene changes to a café.] \nARCHIVIST \nThank you for meeting me. \nMELANIE \nWell, why wouldn’t I? It’s not like you’re ‘wanted for murder’. \nARCHIVIST \nShh. Can you keep it down? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG086 – Tucked In \n15 \n \nMELANIE \nSure, I’ll just quietly sit here and become an accessory, shall I? \nARCHIVIST \nYou, you – You know I didn’t do it. \nMELANIE \nOh. Oh, do I? Is that what I know? \nARCHIVIST \nAlright. Why didn’t you send the police, then? If you genuinely think I’m a \nkiller, why meet me? \nMELANIE \nW– I mean, it’s not… it’s not like you’ve got any reason to kill me. \n[The Archivist grunts, noncommittally] \nMELANIE \nFine. I don’t think you did it. But I still don’t want to get caught up in whatever \nit is. \nARCHIVIST \nShould have thought about that before you joined the Institute. \nMELANIE \nWhat is the deal with you people? Look, I know it’s kind of a boys’ club, but \nyou all really hate me being there, don’t you? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG086 – Tucked In \n16 \n \nARCHIVIST \nWhat? No, I – There’s a lot of very messed up things going on there and, I… I \nmean, we were already tied to them, but you I just… You didn’t need to get \ninvolved. \nMELANIE \nI really don’t think that’s true. \nARCHIVIST \nHow’s the leg? \nMELANIE \nFine. Got shot by a ghost. \nARCHIVIST \nUh… er, what? \nMELANIE \nLook, can we not do that now? I’m really not in the mood. What do you want? \nARCHIVIST \nI… Right. It’s… like I said, there’s a lot of messed up stuff at the Institute, and… I \nthink the murders might be the least of it. I need someone on the inside to \nkeep an eye on things, let me know what’s going on. I’d ask someone else, \nbut… \nMELANIE \nTim hates you, and Martin’s probably being watched. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG086 – Tucked In \n17 \n \nARCHIVIST \nAnd Elias is my chief suspect, so… I’m also rather missing the library. My \ninvestigative tools out here are, uh, lacking. \nMELANIE \nYou know what? Fine. Fine! But you tell me everything. Okay? Everything. \nARCHIVIST \nI mean… you, you won’t believe it. \nMELANIE \nI don’t care. \nARCHIVIST \nAlright. Alright. \nMELANIE \nStart with Sasha. \nARCHIVIST \nOkay. \n[Tape clicks off.] \n[The Magnus Archives Theme - Outro] \nThe Magnus Archives is a podcast distributed by Rusty Quill and licensed under \na creative commons attribution, non-commercial share alike 4.0 international \nlicense.
