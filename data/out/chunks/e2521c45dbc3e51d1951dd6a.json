I’ve been nothing but nice to you. \nARCHIVIST \nMaybe that’s why I never trusted you. \nHELEN \nSee? So rude. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 187 – Checking Out \n \n16 \nARCHIVIST \nOr maybe it’s because you’re an embodiment of the fear of lies and delusion. \nHELEN \nAlso rude. \n(The Archivist makes a small noise of discomfort) \n[The Archivist pauses walking] \nARCHIVIST \nCould you, uh… sorry, could you manifest a room for me? Please. \nHELEN \nWhy? \nARCHIVIST \n…So I can make a statement. \nHELEN \nYou do realise it’s all me, right? If I make a room, I’ll still hear you. Because I’d \nbe the room? \nARCHIVIST \nFine, I just thought— never mind. \n[Hissing static starts] \n(Deep breath) \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 187 – Checking Out \n \n17 \n[The muffled hotel rooms are louder: people unpleasantly laughing, \ntelevision sets] \n[There is the underlying sounds of ragged, hurried breaths and a \nperson moving through the corridor] \n[Hissing static ends] \nARCHIVIST \nI wander through the corridors, quickly, footsteps hurrying, spurred on by the \nworries that chase me. What were the directions she’d said, that smiling, \nfriendly woman in reception? Left, right, right, right, left, straight ahead, then \ndown the stairs. No, no, no, that can’t be it because I just went left and it’s a \ndead end. Well, not a dead end. it’s a door that says ‘Honeymoon Suite’. \nHELEN \n(Saucy) Currently unoccupied… \nARCHIVIST \nI turn to retrace my steps. I-I must have taken a wrong turn. \nHELEN \nJust in case you and Martin were looking for a room. \n[Door knocking and rattling sounds now intersperse the statement] \nARCHIVIST \nHow long… How long has Alex been alone now? On his own? Hours at least. \nAnd he’s only... Four? Five? It doesn’t matter, all that matters is I can picture \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 187 – Checking Out \n \n18 \nhis face, and he’s alone and scared without me. How could I leave my son \nalone in a place like this? How could I do it? \nHELEN \nDeadbeat mum. Classic. \nARCHIVIST \nNone of the doors have numbers on them, no way to know if they’re mine, \neven if I hadn’t lost my keys. I, I bang on each in turn and shout his name. I try \nthe handles even though my palms ache from the blisters. Wait, blisters? How \nmany doors have I tried? \nHELEN \n(Faux concern) Oh, I’m sure it’ll be the next one. \n[Door knocking and rattling sounds finish] \nARCHIVIST \nA flash of movement up ahead. It’s a woman. Do I… recognise her? She looks \nso friendly, with her wide, happy smile and her cheery voice. I tell her I need to \nfind my son, I… I need to check out. Of course, of course, she tells me. She can \nhelp. She’d love nothing more than to help me, although she does hate to see \nme check out, it’s always so hard on her when guests leave. \nHELEN \nI like her! \n[A door closes and the buzz of fluorescent lighting; the hotel room \nsounds have stopped, but the scared breathing continues] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 187 – Checking Out \n \n19 \nARCHIVIST \nShe takes me by the arm and leads me down a narrow service staircase. As we \nnear the bottom I hear a distant cry. \n[A faint distorted screaming sound] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nAlex! I start to run but she says no need to rush. Check-out lasts all day. That’s \ngood to know. My arm is bleeding… When did I cut it? It’s okay, she has some \nbandages. I’m so lucky she’s here. \n[Bandaging sounds] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nShe bandages my arm, and it starts to bleed even more. Something’s wrong \nhere. There’s something behind her smile. I look away. \n[Buzzing stops; hotel room sounds resume] \nARCHIVIST \nThe dull blue paint of the staircase is gone but... I recognise the wallpaper... \nWhere have I seen this wallpaper before? \nHELEN \nNowhere special. \nARCHIVIST \nThe corridor? I’m— No, we were on the stairs. Did we leave? No this isn’t right, \nit isn’t fair. I’ve got to— Wait, where is she? She was lying. Was she? She led \nme here, but now she’s gone and I’m… I’m so tired. When did I sleep last?
