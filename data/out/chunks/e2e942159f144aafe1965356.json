I didn’t have such ideas back then, though. I \njust knew I loved books, always had, and so when the opportunity arose to \nwork in my local library I jumped at the chance. I had been a voracious reader \never since I was old enough to hold a book for myself, and even before that my \nmother tells me I would pester her constantly to read to me. I suppose you \nmight say my mind has always been receptive to the thoughts that lurk in the \nwritten page. Still, Chiswick Library is a long way from the cramped and austere \nlibraries you’re probably imagining. It’s light and airy, with bookshelves and \ncarpets that speak more of cash-strapped local councils than of the rich \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG017 – The Boneturner’s Tale \n3 \n \nmajesty of knowledge. It has an extensive children’s section and the vast \nmajority of its stock are dog-eared paperbacks of true crime, literary fiction \nand reference books. It has a modest collection of books on tape and the \natmosphere, though quiet, is far from oppressive. In a word, I would sum the \nplace up as ‘unthreatening’. \nIt was three years ago when this happened. I had already been working there \nfor about a year when the book first turned up. Now, we used to buy all of our \nbooks new, and I never did any of the acquisitions for the library, so I couldn’t \nsay when or where it might have been bought from, but it looked old and \npretty beaten up when I first noticed it. It was handed back with four other \nbooks at the front desk, and as I was scanning them through I noticed that one \nof the barcodes didn’t seem to match up. The barcode and ISBN both \nregistered as being that of Trainspotting by Irvine Welsh, but the book itself \nwas an almost featureless black paperback, with a title on the front in a faded \nwhite serif font The Boneturner’s Tale. \nI was a bit confused, and called the librarian, Ruth Weaver, over to ask about \nit. She didn’t recall seeing it ever before, but stuck in the front was the ex-libris \nbookplate of Chiswick Library, as well as a lending label with a handful of \nstamps going back several years. Ruth shrugged and told me not to worry too \nmuch about it – we’d get it recorded and put on the system properly, but \nsomething about the situation bothered me, so I decided to check the record \nof the man who had returned it. His name, at least according to his library \ncard, was Michael Crew, and sure enough three weeks ago he had borrowed \nfour books from us. Specifically, the four others he had returned. I suggested \nto Ruth that perhaps he was a self-published author who was trying to trick his \nway onto our shelves, and she laughed, saying it was probably it, although why \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG017 – The Boneturner’s Tale \n4 \n \nanyone would go to the trouble of faking it just to get on the shelves of \nChiswick Library was beyond her. The book even looked worn, though, like it \nhad seen decades of being read, with a line creased down the spine and one \nhalf of the cover faded from the sun. Nor, from what I could see, did it list any \nauthor at all. \nIt was at that moment that Jared Hopworth came in, and I had to put the book \nto one side. Jared and I had once been fast friends; growing up on the same \nroad, attending the same schools, we had spent much of our early life as \ninseparable. But he had always been, well, not to put too fine a point on it, \nthick as mud, and when I went away to university, he stayed behind. I think he \nsaw it as something of a betrayal, and when I finally returned, I knew \nimmediately something had changed between us. He spent the time I was \naway becoming a bit of a crook, and upon my return began what would \neventually become a campaign of petty terror. He was always very careful to \nstop before he did anything that might get the police involved, and I guess \nthere was enough leftover affection from a childhood spent together that I \nnever really thought about reporting him.
