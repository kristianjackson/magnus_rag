If, If what \nhe’s saying is even half true, I need to be there. \nARCHIVIST \nBut what if you don’t? (Small exhale) We could just leave. I mean, whatever \ntheir plan is for me, I am damn sure that doing that isn’t it. I’d derail \neverything- we could derail everything, and then just- leave! \n(Martin laughs, humourlessly) \nARCHIVIST \nWhat? \n(Martin keeps laughing.) \nMARTIN \nNothing; It’s just- (one more laugh) It’s just ironic, that’s all. \nARCHIVIST \nMartin… \nMARTIN \nWho are you kidding, Jon? You’re not going to do any of that. \nARCHIVIST \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 154 – Bloody Mary \nI, I could. \nMARTIN \n(Still brimming with false laughter) But you won’t. That’s why you came to \nme, isn’t it? \n(The Archivist exhales.) \nMARTIN (CONT’D) \nYou know I can’t do it, not now; you don’t want to blind yourself; you don’t \nwant to die; what you want is a reason to not do those things, so- you come to \nme. Well, you’re welcome. B,Because I can’t follow you on this one. \nARCHIVIST \nThe Lonely’s really got you, hasn’t it? \nMARTIN \n(No hesitation) You know, I think it always did. \n(Small pause.) \nARCHIVIST \n(Quiet) Maybe. (beat) Well, I’ll be here, if you ever need me. \nMARTIN \n(Also quieter, softer) I hope so. \nARCHIVIST \n(Faster) Just-don’t-wait-too-long, okay? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 154 – Bloody Mary \n \n[He moves towards the door, sighs.] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nIf you haven’t already. \n[He opens the door, leaves. It shuts.] \nMARTIN \nYeah. (Wearier) Yeah. \n[Tape clicks off.] \n[The Magnus Archives Theme – Outro] \nJONATHAN SIMS \nThe Magnus Archives is a podcast distributed by Rusty Quill, and licensed \nunder a Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Share-Alike 4.0 \nInternational License. \nToday’s episode was written by Jonathan Sims and directed by Alexander J \nNewall. \nTo subscribe, view associated material, or join our Patreon, visit rustyquill.com. \nRate and review us online, tweet us at TheRustyQuill, visit us on Facebook, or \nemail us at mail@rustyquill.com \nJoin our communities on the forum via the website or on Reddit, at \nr/TheMagnusArchives.
