Audio recording by Jonathan Sims, the Archivist. \nStatement begins. \nARCHIVIST (STATEMENT) \nUm… er… But my affliction in writing to you is of a wholly different character, \nand were I not well sure of your firm alliance and counsel I should under no \nextremity impose it upon you. For I have killed a man, and barely do I have the \ncovering of great passion for it, as I was well within my senses at the time. \nYou are familiar of course with my persecutor and tormentor Edmond Halley. \nThe one so oft descending upon me as Nemesis with her sword to avenge upon \nmy hubris. It was he who with the President of the Royal Society, Sir Isaac \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 140 – The Movement of the Heavens \n \n7 \n \nNewton, printed my catalogue of stars without my knowledge, robbing me of \nthe fruits of my labour, turning my triumph to naught but ashes. \nI have had many a contest with the President, but I harbour little true \nbitterness toward him. He is a blockish creature of vanity concerned with his \nappearance only, and like to fly into an indecent heat and knavish talk at any \ndispute. He has no reverence for God and I pity him the fire that awaits, but in \nlife my thoughts of him are simply those of disdain and hold no corner for true \nhatred. \nI put no such chain upon my spirit when I make my considerations of Halley, \nwho I have long called Raymer to you in my letters, for as the odious Nicolaus \nRaymer persecuted the great Tycho and ran his noble genius to exile, so too \nhas my own Raymer pushed me toward ruin. I have detailed much of his \noffences in my letters to you, but as much again I have concealed within my \nsoul and given no voice. Simply know the robbery of my celestial catalogue was \nbut the least of it. \nI will admit that in my heart I nurtured such dreams of revenge that when they \ncame to me the name of God felt hollow upon my lips. Another dignity \nstripped from me by mine enemy. Such were the depths of the hatred that I \nfound within myself, that whereupon I would spy Raymer at the Royal Society, \nif I were unobserved in turn, I would to no deliberate end begin to follow him. \nOft it was I would follow his path until my better humours overtook me, or I \nwas seen by my quarry, who would smile and offer his insufferable greeting. So \nit has been this past year, though I have never had he might know my \nintentions. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 140 – The Movement of the Heavens \n \n8 \n \nYet this month past it has been much changed. Raymer’s wanderings, hitherto \naimless or meandering through the gardens and pathways of the Royal Society \nor the coffee shops of Fleet Street, have of late drawn him almost out of \nLondon entirely, to a strange and shrouded wood not a league from what \nmight draw the interest of the pompous fool with whose whims I was now so \nwell acquainted. And in that quiet seclusion, while I looked on in silence and \nastonishment, he would meet with figures, both man and woman alike, with \ndull clothing and eyes that in the darkness of that wooded place seemed \nwholly black and empty. Their words were soft and impenetrable to me from \nthe spot wherein I was concealed, but they had much impact upon Raymer, \nwho oft would stagger backwards as though struck. \nThey led him further through trees of gnarled and twisted woods, where the \nthick roof of leaves permitted not the light of moon or stars, and there they \nknelt around a pool so black if it had been India ink it could scarce have been \ndarker. I held back a cry that threatened to force itself from my lips, for I am \nnot so ignorant as to be blind to the practice of vile pagan exaltation, and I can \ndescribe what I saw around that pool as nothing less. And dismiss as you will \nmy words as the shaken memory of a man appalled, but at that awful moment, \ntheir cries of worship seemed to form shapes that stirred in the water such as I \nhave never seen in my time upon this earth. \nI fled, of course, and considered the courses such as I might pursue to relieve \nmyself of this dreadful burden of knowledge. No longer was my concern purely \nfor revenge upon Raymer, but a quite acute terror of the savage rites the \npractice of which were clearly amongst my peers. I had not seen with clarity \nthose compatriots alongside whom Raymer had joined in awful raptures, and \ncould not state with confidence that any among the faculty to whom I might", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 1, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 4430}}
