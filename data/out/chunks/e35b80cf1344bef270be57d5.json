I knew then that she hadn’t heard it, that she would \nnever hear it. And I felt completely alone. I remember I almost envied Chilcott, \nbecause at least he had known what he was signing up for. \n \nThe next month passed more normally, I think. Though beyond a certain point, \nat the edge of everything you’ve ever known, the word ‘normal’ loses its \nmeaning. Manuela became more and more withdrawn – more focused on her \nown research, whatever it might have been – while I more or less stopped \ndoing mine entirely. I got no new instructions. I would find myself staring out \ninto space for a few minutes, and then, when I checked the time, hours would \nhave passed. I don’t remember if I slept. \n \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG106 ‘A Matter of Perspective’ \n \n7 \n \nI honestly can’t remember if going out to work on the solar panels was repair \nwork, or if I’d finally been given a new task that required going outside. I just \nremember sealing the bulky EVA suit and stepping into the airlock, pushing \nmyself out into the nothing. The tether coiled out behind me, spooling metre \nafter metre after metre. But I wasn’t going towards the solar panels. Why? \nWhere was I going? I floated slowly off into the empty unending space, and the \ntether line just kept on going. The station drifted further and further away. I \ncould feel myself falling up, falling out, falling off of everything that could be \ncalled the world. The station was gone, as was the planet of my birth, of \neverything that gave me my existence. It shrank as I watched until it became \nless than the smallest dot. I couldn’t have been that far away. It’s impossible. \nBut I was. I was so far from all existence, surrounded by the vacuum of \neverything, I could feel my soul trying to expand to fill the never-ending \nabsence, and it hurt. \n \nI don’t know how long I was floating for. I know it was less than a billion years, \nwhich is barely a heartbeat in the life of the universe, so how can it really be \nsaid to matter? The stars began to wink out, one by one, and I thought, \nperhaps for a second, or perhaps for a hundred years, that I had reached the \nend of time, and I was watching the gradual fading of the universe. And then I \nrealised the obvious. I could not see the stars because something was blocking \nthem. It moved and flowed across my vision, and every motion seemed to \nsnuff out more light. There was no shape to see, no outline that can be drawn \nof this thing so dark and enormous I could feel my stomach trying to vomit, my \nmind trying to expand, to take in the size of what moves between the stars, \nfilling my entire vision and more. I knew that if it chose to cry out it would have \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG106 ‘A Matter of Perspective’ \n \n8 \n \ndestroyed me utterly, and I know that there was no possibility it could ever \nnotice that I existed. \n \nI don’t believe in God. I can’t believe that a being of such limitless power and \nknowledge would still notice humanity, would understand or care about its \nexistence. But I keep thinking back to an old professor of mine, back when I \nbriefly studied neuroscience, talking about consciousness, about how we still \ndon’t honestly know what it is, where it comes from, what aspect of the brain \nmakes it possible. And I wonder if there might not be consciousnesses out \nthere, so far beyond our comprehension that we could not properly recognise \nthem as such. Minds so strange and colossal that we would never know they \nwere minds at all. Perhaps, out there in the endless vast, they would not notice \nor recognise us in return. And I wish that I could convince myself that \nignorance was the same thing as safety, but then, how many weeds have you \nunthinkingly stepped on in your lifetime? \n \nStatement ends. \n \nMELANIE \nOh. That, um, well that seems... That seems to be … \n \n(Paper gets shuffled) \n \nThat’s all of it. Hm, well, Jan Kilbride definitely returned to Earth with his \ncolleagues, and he certainly seems to have given this statement in person, so... \nI mean, he did come back somehow.
