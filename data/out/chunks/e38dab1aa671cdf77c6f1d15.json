It looked more as though it had been painted on the wall and then covered \nup with layers of wallpaper over the years, until finally being unearthed by \nstripping it away. What was slightly more concerning, was that watching \nBethany pace around the room, following my gaze with some confusion, was \nthat she didn’t seem able to see it. When I asked her what the word on the \nwall meant to her, she looked at me as though I was talking nonsense. \nI didn’t seem like there was much more to be gained there at that point, so I \nperformed a short blessing over the place, took some photographs and told \nBethany that I would have to come back later once I’d looked into a few things. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG019 – Confession \n6 \n \nShe seemed disappointed there wasn’t anything more immediate that I was \ndoing, but didn’t try to argue. And so I left what would turn out to be my first \nvisit to the house on Bullingdon Road, calling Father Singh to arrange a \nmeeting the next day where we could discuss whether to attempt a full \nexorcism. \nIt was at that meeting that I got the call from the hospital. Bethany had been \nadmitted with severe facial lacerations and was asking to see me immediately. \nI made my way to the John Radcliffe as soon as I was able and was surprised to \nsee two police officers standing near her bed. I was met by Anne Willett, the \nnurse who Bethany had asked to call me. I knew Annie a bit already, as she’d \nattended the church where I ministered and I recognised her from the \ncongregation. She explained to me that Bethany had apparently attempted to \nattack one of her housemates with a kitchen knife, and in the ensuing struggle \nended up falling head first into a full-length mirror, cutting herself very badly. \nI was, to put it mildly, somewhat taken aback. This was such an escalation from \nwhat Bethany had described before, and I was starting to fear that if I didn’t \nmanage to do something the poor girl would most likely end up locked away \nsomewhere. Annie was convinced that an exorcism was the only way, and so \nfinally, I agreed to do so. I had already got permission from the Bishop, but that \nwas before Bethany’s hospitalisation, and I would have preferred to discuss it \nwith him. Still, it was clear she was getting worse and I decided to take a risk \nand try it anyway. It was a stupid risk to take. I was cocky and complacent, full \nof spiritual pride and an eagerness to test my faith against whatever was inside \nof Bethany’s soul, not even considering that I might be risking it. Still, I have \npaid dearly for my hubris. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG019 – Confession \n7 \n \nWe waited until the police had taken their statements and left, and then I set \nup and began the exorcism. It went... unusually. There was no resistance from \nBethany, almost no reaction at all, and in many parts of the ceremony where in \nmy experience there was usually a response either from the demon, or at least \nthe victim, there was instead just… silence, as she stared at me with a look, \nalmost seemed like pity. Annie just stood in the corner, watching and clearly \neager to help, despite the fear I saw in her eyes. At last, Bethany locked eyes \nwith me and slowly shook her head. “I’m so sorry,” she said, “It wants your \nfaith.” \nWithout warning she began to convulse. Thrashing in obvious pain. I tried to \ncontinue the ritual, but the doctors pushed passed me, desperately trying to \nhelp Bethany as blood began to pour from her mouth where she had bitten \ninto her tongue. In the end they couldn’t save her. Brain haemorrhage, they \nsaid, probably from the blow to head when she hit the mirror and they just \nhadn’t spotted it. \nI was asked to leave in no uncertain terms, and the doctors made it very clear \nthat I may not have been the one that hit her in the head, but they held me \nvery much accountable for her death. I was also given a very thorough dressing \ndown by my Bishop, who told me to take a step back and leave the exorcisms \nto Father Harrogate for some time. Annie almost got suspended over the \nmatter, but in the end was spared further disciplinary action, as she had been \nsimply passing on the wishes of the patient. \nAnd for a couple of years that was it. I felt a great deal of guilt over my \ninvolvement with Bethany’s death, and I started to drink more than I had \nbefore. I was never, I think, in danger of becoming an alcoholic, as most of the \npriests I worked with had done work with substance abusers – no", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 3, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 4500}}
