They \ndescended for some time, until I was quite certain that I was deep within the \nfrozen earth of the Schwarzwald. At last, the steps ended in a short corridor, \nand I could see the bricks that formed the walls and arched ceiling had \ncrumbled and shifted in places, allowing ingress to the thick roots of the trees \nabove, which coiled and splayed across those parts of the passage in most \nneed of repair. After about a minute of walking, the passage opened out into a \nlarge chamber. In the centre stood another block of marble, almost identical to \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG023 – Schwartzwald \n10 \n \nthe one I had seen upstairs, but atop this one was a sealed, stone coffin. The \nname ‘Johann von Württemberg’ was carved here too, though preserved in \nmuch clearer detail without the elements to wear it away. \nAs I gazed at it, I noticed that the walls of the room did not appear to be stone, \nas the passage or the mausoleum had been. I walked cautiously closer, until \nmy lantern illuminated it clearly. The walls were covered with bookshelves. \nPacked in with such a density that it was impossible to tell if there was a real \nwall behind them or if the books themselves formed the only bulwark against \nthe soil. They were, unfortunately, terribly rotten. The centuries had not been \nkind to them, and as I tried to move one of them I realised that the damp had, \nover time, caused them to merge into a single mass of paper and bookcloth. \nPredictable as this may have been, I still felt the most acute pang of loss. To \nsee such a volume of knowledge, possibly unique in all the world, utterly \ndestroyed, was incredibly painful to me. The actual shelves were formed of the \nsame marble as the two blocks, and seemed to have fared better. As I looked \nat them, I noticed a small engraving, carved at regular intervals along the edge \nof each one. It was a small eye, open and staring. \nFor some reason, it was only at that moment that I began to feel afraid. Of \nwhat, I couldn’t tell you, but those small eyes filled me with a dread that I have \ntrouble describing to you now. Certainly I backed away from the bookshelves, \nand was all set to depart, when my lantern caught on something in the corner \nof the room. Or more precisely, two things: the first was a small gold coin that \nglinted on the floor. The second was a book, perhaps fallen from the shelves \nlong ago. It was in far better condition than the others, perhaps due to where \nit had lain, and I was able to very carefully open it.
