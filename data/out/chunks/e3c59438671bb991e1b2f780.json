No \none’s really given me an official account of what happened, aside from that it \nbecame known I was in serious danger of death and my colleagues on the \nDaedalus retrieved me and managed to keep me alive until the next \nopportunity to send me back down. I’m not pushing to know more, not really. I \nknow what happened and no rational cover story that they could feed me is \ngoing to change it. I haven’t followed up with Conrad and, as far as I’m aware, \nhe hasn’t made any attempt to contact me. I was paid in full though, which \nwas a surprise. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 057 – Personal Space \n \n12 \n \nI wanted to tell someone what really happened for almost a year before I \nfound your Institute. There’s nothing really to be done about it, but I wanted to \nget it off my chest. So, thank you for letting me get it down on paper. \nARCHIVIST \nStatement ends. \nWhile there’s plenty of media coverage of the launch of the Daedalus satellite \nin early 2007 by Stratosphere Group, a consortium of various scientific and \naerospace companies, it seems the actual operation of the facility is guarded \nwith a great deal more secrecy by the various organisations involved. Martin \nwas able to confirm that during its two years of operation it did have a total of \nthree staff on board: Jan Kilbride, Manuela Dominguez and Mr Chilcott. \nBeyond that, however, there’s little that can be retrieved from beyond the wall \nof corporate bureaucracy. \nTim was, however, able to get a list of the businesses involved in the venture. \nThree names stand out: Pinnacle Aerospace, majority owned by the Fairchild \nfamily; a large private investment by Nathaniel Lukas; and Optic Solutions \nLimited, a relatively benign seeming company, manufacturing specialist \ncameras for research and industrial application, who are nonetheless notable \nfor having their business address listed as being in Ny-Ålesund in Norway. I \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 057 – Personal Space \n \n13 \n \nfear, however, that’s as much digging as I can do at the moment without \ndrawing attention, so it may be wise to let the matter drop. \nEnd recording. \n[Tape clicks off. Tape clicks on.] \nNOT!SASHA \nJohn? \nARCHIVIST \nUm... \nNOT!SASHA \nWhat are you doing? \nARCHIVIST \nSash... er, I can’t seem to find the new file for the Hill Top Road case. I thought \nI gave it to you to follow up on the children? \nNOT!SASHA \nYou did, and I gave it back. \n \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 057 – Personal Space \n \n14 \n \nARCHIVIST \nAh, right. \nNOT!SASHA \nEven if I hadn’t, I would very much prefer it if you stay out of my desk. \nARCHIVIST \nOh, of course, sorry. I didn’t realise you were still here, or I would have asked. \nNOT!SASHA \nOf course. \nARCHIVIST \nI’ll see if it’s with Tim then. \nNOT!SASHA \nAlso, John, I have asked before. \nARCHIVIST \nWhat? \n[When Sasha speaks, the tape distorts slightly.] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 057 – Personal Space \n \n15 \n \nNOT!SASHA \nPlease don’t record our conversations. \n[Tape clicks off. Tape clicks on.] \nARCHIVIST \nStupid. I thought Sasha had left for the evening. I wanted to have a look in her \ndesk for anything that might shed light on her recent weird behaviour. I didn’t \nget much of a chance, but it all looked normal, except there were a few scraps \nof torn paper. They could be from files or just torn scrap paper. It’s hard to tell. \nI’m at a loss why she would want to destroy files though. Still, I think I probably \nneed to back off from Sasha for a while after this. I’ll just keep an eye from a \ndistance for now. \nI did find several pictures of her and her new boyfriend though, which puts my \nmind somewhat at ease. Well, mostly. There’s something about him that \ndoesn’t seem quite right. Something about the smile, maybe? I mean, they’re \nall pictures of Sasha and Tom, as I’m told his name is, having fun together, \nbut... it’s hard to put into words exactly, but every one of them looks somehow \nlike a stock photo. \n[Tape clicks off.]", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 5, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 4106}}
