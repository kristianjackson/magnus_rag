No one \nreal ever really listens to me anyway. Oh, they, they nod and respond and say \n‘No, Martin,’ or ‘Not now, Martin,’ or ‘Leave it, Martin’ but, funny thing is, \n(false bright) I-I didn't ask them to do anything! I just, just wanted to see if \nthey needed a hand, heh. Is that me? Is-is that me? Martin? Martin. Maartin. \nMartin. Doesn't sound right. But who else would I be? Hm, whoever owns this \nhouse, I guess. It certainly doesn't seem like the sort of place that someone \ncalled Martin would live. Martin. It feels like a small name. One that wants to \nbe warm and happy. Not like here. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 170 – Recollection \n15 \nYou know I've wandered around all these rooms and, they all just make me \nfeel alone. They scare me. \nEven when I find someone else, I feel alone. Did I tell you? I found someone \nelse wandering around. They were all thin and grey. Faded. Like they'd been \nhere for ages. I think they'd been crying, but it's so hard to tell through the fog. \nI tried to talk to them, but it was just, just difficult. I asked who they were, and \nthey, looked at me like they had no idea what I was talking about. \n‘What's your name?’ I said, ‘Your name? You must have a name!’ but they just \nshrugged, and I, and, and they gestured at me. Like they wanted to know my \nname, and I—th— I co— I couldn't tell them! I couldn't remember! \n‘Is this your house?’ I asked, and they said, they said yes. But, then they \nstopped, a-and shook their head. A-and then then they started to laugh. \nQuietly, for a bit, and then they cried. And they wouldn't stop. I, I— \n(emotional) They asked me who they were, if there was anyone looking for \nthem. If there was anybody left who even cared, but I, I didn't know. I, I didn't \nknow, and I— I ran away, I had to run away! (sob) I, I had to go and have a sit-\ndown, okay? I just— \n [Chair scrapes on the floorboards] \nMARTIN (CONT'D) \n—I just wish I’d thought to buy some nicer chairs. Still. It’s not like I've got \nguests coming, is it? (shaky breaths) The house is empty, and, and honestly? I, \nI can't think of anyone in the world who would care if I lived or died. \n(Sobbing, quiet) I’m, I'm scared. I think this fog is doing something to me, I \ncan't… I'm losing myself, and I, and I don't know if I mind? Maybe I deserve it. \nSo much of what's behind the fog hurts. So much of it just makes me wanna \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 170 – Recollection \n16 \ncurl up with pain and embarrassment and— Maybe the fog's here because I \nwant it here. Is that why I opened the windows? Maybe I asked the fog to \ncome. \nNo. No, no, n-no, no, that's not true, I, I remember! Hundreds, thousands of \nlost souls, wandering the halls. Hollow memories, with eyes full of tears. I've \nseen them. They're all trying to remember. T-to recall, to picture someone, \nanyone who loves them, and their hearts are all full of fear. Afraid that those \npeople are gone forever. That maybe, maybe they never existed at all. \n(Distressed) Why am I here? I, I fell behind. I was, I was too slow, and, and, and \nthe fog caught up; I was, I was following, al-always following, never leading. \nNever leading. \nWhy did he leave me behind? D-did he? Who are, w-who are you? Who am? \n[Hissing static starts] \nMARTIN (CONT'D) \n(Remembering) J- J- John. John, John. Yes. John, I remember him. I need to, I \nneed to keep him here. If he can find me, I, he, he knows enough; surely he \nKnows enough to find me, but I can't… \n[Hissing static ends] \nMARTIN (CONT'D) \n(Aggitated) If I forget him, if, if I forget, me, maybe-maybe there's nothing left \nto know. No one to find. \n[Martin gets up from the chair]", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 5, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 3739}}
