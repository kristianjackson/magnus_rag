And he was being attacked, that much was clear, but there \nwasn’t anyone there. The thing that was grabbing him, trying to reach down \nhis throat and pull him apart… it was a pattern. Diamonds and swirls and \ncolours that seemed to imprint itself upon his skin even as it pushed itself \nmessily into his nose and mouth. What it was made of, I couldn’t say; the way \nit moved and shifted made my head throb with pain. I screamed, staggered \nback and fell, hitting my head on the table. I can’t have been out for more than \na few seconds, but when I opened my eyes he was there, dragging the \nthrashing body of Gantulga through the door and up onto the deck. I followed \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 141 – Doomed Voyage \nslowly, unsteadily, but got there just in time to see Salesa throw both him and \nwhat looked like a blank rug over the side and into the ocean. \nThen he collapsed against the railing, a look of intense exhaustion passing over \nhis face, and I left him there. \nHe was drunk for the next two days, and we kept sailing on towards Cape \nTown. We no longer had anything to deliver there, but no-one was really sure \nwhat else to do. Whenever there’d been similar disasters before, Salesa was \nquick to make a new plan, let know Captain Gaultier know what the next steps \nwere. It was one of the reasons the crew trusted him so much. He just always \nseemed to know what we needed to do next. \nThis time, though… felt different. He was distant, quiet. His words, when he \nspoke to you at all, were blurred with alcohol and regret. Nobody knew what \nthe plan was, so we just kept going. \nWhen we hit port, he disappeared for a while, nobody was sure where, and \neven when he showed back up he was spending his time on the phone. We all \nassumed he was trying to arrange the next job, but he had this… wild energy \nI’d never seen in him before, and it scared me. \nWhatever he was planning, it wasn’t going to be like the others. We were sure \nabout that. \nFinally, he calls us all together. The captain’s there, but he doesn’t look happy. \nSalesa starts talking, says he’s been doing this too long, he’s getting slow. Says \nhe’s retiring. So far, so sad, but not unexpected at that point. Then he says he \nwants to send us off with a proper payday, that there’s one last job he wants \nus to do. Very dangerous, very illegal. There are murmurs, questions, some \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 141 – Doomed Voyage \nangry, some confused. Salesa says anyone who doesn’t want to be a part of it, \nthey can stay in port with a decent severance and find another job. A few take \nhim up on that, and the rest of us decide to stay, though the captain’s clearly \nnot happy this is costing him experienced crew. Still, he doesn’t speak up. I can \nsee in his eyes the greed’s got him, like it’s got the rest of us. It’s not like we \nwere underpaid on the Dorian, but there were rumours about how much \nmoney Salesa was making out of all this. When someone like that says there’s \ngoing to be a big payout, you listen. \nHe was really cagey on the details, clearly being careful about exactly who he \nwas telling exactly what. All I knew about what we going on were as follows: \nwe were on our way to the Maldives, to a tiny island about a hundred \nkilometers south of Malé. No-one would tell me the name of the island, but in \nthat area of the world any islands that small are usually private, though I had \nno idea who the owner might have been. Once there, Salesa and the four \ncrewmembers he trusted most were going to take the small boat over to the \nisland. We were to wait, and prepare to depart as quickly as possible as soon \nas they returned. He didn’t say exactly what he was expecting to happen on \nthe island, but it wasn’t hard to guess that whatever he was retrieving, it \nwasn’t something he was purchasing legally. He made it clear we shouldn’t \nstop if we were followed or challenged by the authorities, and we should all be \nprepared to defend the ship should anyone attempt to board or stop us. \nThe three hours I stood on the deck after they left on the little boat may well \nhave been the longest of my life. It was night, of course, and we had no lights \nshowing, nothing that would give us away. The island was completely dark as \nwell, and if it hadn’t been for the bright moon shining down on the dense trees \nand sandy beach, I might not have been able to see it at all.
