Had she been wearing \nthat the night before? Surely not. Although, I suppose I didn’t really look at her \nclothes. Sat on a folding chair next to her was a squat, thickly muscled woman \nwith close-cropped black hair, who stared at me with a really vicious-looking \nsmirk. She exchanged a glance with Megan, who just nodded at her, and then \nshe burst into cruel laughter, and I was suddenly feeling very uncomfortable. \nI just stood there, toolbox in hand, debating whether or not to turn around and \ndrive away. I had just about decided to leave when I felt Megan’s hand grip my \nwrist. I hadn’t noticed her moving towards me. Her fingers dug into me, and \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG087 – The Uncanny Valley \n8 \n \nthey felt really, really wrong. Like hard plastic wrapped in raw bacon. She was \nstrong though, strong enough to drag me toward the big workshop and its \nopen door. I was struggling, and told her to let me go, but she just ignored me. \nI cried out to the woman sat on the lawn chair for help, but she just laughed \nharder. \nI was still begging for help when I felt Megan’s hard, cold fingers dig into the \ntop of my head and turn it to face into the building. I hadn’t noticed that we’d \nreached the door, but in the afternoon sunlight, the reality of what I had \nwalked through the night before was clearly shown in terrible detail. \nRows and rows of old and broken stools stood before crude frames of wire and \nwood. Sat on each stool were figures of all shapes and sizes. None of them \nwere human. Some were wood themselves, old, and stained with rot. Some \nwere a shiny, dark plastic or porcelain white. A few were cloth and hessian, \nstuffed to bursting and leaking sawdust from a dozen places. All of them were \nfeatureless, and moved with a jerky motion like nothing I had seen outside of \nmy dreams. \nEach gripped a razor-sharp knife, and moved it swiftly over the human heads \nsuspended in the frames from wire and fishhooks, gently cutting around the \nedges. I could see the rest of the bodies piled haphazardly in the corner, and \nfor a second all I was able to do was wonder why they didn’t smell worse than \nthey did. \nThen all the cutting figures turned to face me at once, and I screamed. And \nwhen I screamed, the eyes of every head swivelled in their frames and stared \nat me with the desperate pleading that told me they still knew pain. I was \nbabbling, pleading with Megan, asking what she wanted. “I want you to meet \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG087 – The Uncanny Valley \n9 \n \nour boss,” she said lightly. I didn’t know who that was, and she stared at me, \nskin starting to slip away from her painted-on eyes. “You may call them I Do \nNot Know You.” \nI don’t know why those words filled me with such deep dread, but I felt every \nmuscle in my body tighten. On instinct, and without warning, I swung the \ntoolbox up with all the force I had in me into Megan’s face, and heard the \ncrunching crack of something brittle shatter. Her hand released my arm as I \nstared at her, face now twisted and hanging off the dark plastic of her head, \nthe empty mouth moving, trying to match the vile sounds coming from the rest \nof her. \nI ran, sprinting back to my van as fast as I could, only to see that the woman \nwith the cropped hair had stood up and moved to the driver’s side door. I \ndidn’t have time to slow down; I just prepared to try and tackle her, when she \ndid something I didn’t expect. She opened the door for me, and stepped back. \nNot taking time to consider this, I leapt into the seat, and started to fumble for \nthe keys. The engine roared to life immediately, and I was just about to get out \nof there when I realised I could feel the woman’s hand on my shoulder. I \nlooked at her, the door still open, and she winked at me. Without warning, a \nterrible, blistering heat erupted on my back, and I screamed again, this time in \nagony. Reflex slammed my foot down, and I felt the car start as she removed \nher hand, laughing that same horrible laugh. \nI did manage to get away, though there’s a good chance I’ll never use this arm \nproperly again. I went to the police, of course. I didn’t tell them exactly what \nhappened, just that I’d noticed what I believed to be human remains during a \njob, and had been attacked as I tried to leave. They actually took me seriously,", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 3, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 4356}}
