I know I'm here to provide a statement of \nmy own experience, and I will, but there's something so revealing in the stories \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG029 – Cheating Death \n2 \n \nthat grow up in a culture, wouldn't you say? And I promise it will be relevant by \nthe end. I can guarantee it's not in your library, either, because as far as I know \nthis story has never been written down.
