It stood open, \nunmoving, with no light at all coming from inside. As my light crossed the \ndoorframe, I could see the windows had been covered with thick wooden \nboards, and painted a dark matte black. In the corner of my mind, I could feel \npanic starting to claw its way up, as the darkness started to press in on me. I \ncalled out again, but there was still no reply. I wanted to turn around and run \nback to the light, but not enough, not as much as I wanted to overcome my \nfear. \n \nI slowly headed inside, calling out every few steps to make sure anyone who \nmight be in there knew I was with security. Inside, the rooms were bare, \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG109 – Nightfall \n \n15 \n \ncompletely empty. There was no sign they’d ever been used to run a business, \nand the only sign that I wasn’t the first person to set foot in there was the \ncomplete absence of dust or dirt. I checked another room, but it was exactly \nthe same. The same with the third I checked, and the fourth. Then I opened a \nnormal-looking wooden door near the back, and I froze, once again on the \nthreshold of something that didn’t make sense. \n \nIn front of me was what should have been a normal meeting room, but it was \nfar from that. The floor was covered in water, pitch black and utterly still. I \nknew in my mind it couldn’t be more than a few millimetres deep, it didn’t \neven spread past the doorway when I opened it, but as my torchlight reflected \noff the surface, it seemed to me like it was much, much deeper. In the centre \nof the room was a plain wood and metal table, with a man lying on top of it. I’d \nnever seen him before. He lay motionless, and I could make out a thin, dark \ntrickle of liquid flowing from his mouth and eyes, over his face and dripping \ndown the table legs into the dark water. Three figures stood around him, the \nother workers from the office. Each was stood on a small square platform a \nfew inches off the floor, facing directly towards the central table, arms \noutstretched and mouths wide as though they were screaming. They still made \nabsolutely no sound. \n \nI don’t know how long I was frozen there, staring at the scene in front of me. \nNothing was right about what I was seeing. I started to scream at them, \nshouted to stop whatever they were doing or I’d call the police. They didn’t \nseem even remotely aware of me. Finally, I decided I was going to leave, to \nmake the call, but not before I got the man on the table out of there. He clearly \nneeded help, and whatever these silent screamers were doing to him wasn’t \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG109 – Nightfall \n \n16 \n \nhelping. I told them. I announced what I was about to do, but still got no \nresponse. So I stepped into the room and over to the table. \n \nAs soon as my foot hit the water, I fell into it completely. It was colder than \nanything I had ever experienced, and the torch slipped from my hand as my \nvision immediately went dark. I tried to orientate myself, to find which way \nwas up, and I saw a faint pinprick of light, as my torch sank away from me, \ndown and down and down, into the icy black water. I started to panic then, \nwith the lightless deep pressing in on me, eager to take me away. I was \nabsolutely sure that in a few moments there would be no surface left, just dark \nstill water forever. \n \nTREVOR \nLuckily, I’d been watching a while, and I saw her go down. I didn’t have a clue \nwhat were going on – still don’t – but I was quick enough to get there and \nreach my arm into the water before she were too far gone. It were bloody \ncold. I couldn’t see anything, obviously. I had my own light, but it just bounced \noff the surface. I could feel the back of her jacket down there, though, and I \nmade a grab for it. \n \nNow, I’m not as strong as I was, maybe, but I held on and pulled. Wasn’t \nenough to get her out, something in there didn’t want to let her go, but I got \nher high enough that her arm broke the surface. She flailed a second, but got \nhold of the doorframe and started to pull herself out. Took her a while, but she \nwere almost there when I heard something moving behind us. Turned around \nto see Darvish stood there, and he did not look happy. I were already holding \nthe knife. I could smell him so thick it tasted like rancid treacle, and whatever", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 5, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 4343}}
