You must never underestimate how violent and desperate a \ntrapped animal can become. \nWe were cruel to them. I am not ashamed of that. If I were to tell you all the \ncrimes of those monsters we kept in the ERU, you’d probably lose your lunch \nbefore I was halfway through the list. Keeping them beat down was the only \nway to make sure they behaved. And besides, atonement is important. \nI’ll admit though, I always had a soft spot for Robert Montauk. He never gave \nus any trouble. Away from the other prisoners, he seemed docile, almost eerily \nso sometimes. Also, and it’s a small thing, but he never denied his crimes. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG052 – Exceptional Risk \n12 \n \nWakefield is one of those prisons where everyone is innocent and it gets so \ndull to hear their whining protestations day after day. Anyone who fully owned \ntheir crimes always went up in my estimation. I mean, we still beat him down \non occasion, but not as bad as the others. \nAfter a year or two, I kind of started to forget who he was, you know? The \nmystique of being Britain’s most successful serial killer just didn’t hold up. \nWhen you have someone in your power like that, you forget any respect you \nmight have had for them. And he never gave us any trouble. \nIn 2001, he started to get visitors. His daughter, mostly. Given that she hadn’t \nvisited before, I’d guess she’d just turned 18. You get that a lot. \nUnaccompanied visits aren’t allowed under that age and plenty of inmates \nhave kids living with over-protective guardians who refuse to take them, so I \nassumed she was similar. The visitor rooms in the main prison are quite nice. \nNot so much in the Exceptional Risk Unit. A dark, bare room, like all of them, \ncut down the middle with a reinforced window. There were plenty of lights in \nthere, but somehow it always seemed gloomy. I was on observation for a few \nof their father-daughter visits. She would talk about her life like her dad wasn’t \na murderer; he would lie about how it wasn’t too bad in the prison. It was all \nvery touching, I’m sure. \nAside from his daughter, there was only one other time that he had a visitor. It \nwas six months before he died, late March 2002. It was an older guy, I’d guess \nlate fifties, wearing a well-tailored black suit and an expression of disgust. \nWhen I brought Montauk in, his face fell and he went very pale. I’d helped \nfolks beat Robert Montauk a dozen times or more, but I had never seen him \nlook scared. He sat down opposite the old man and they looked each other in \nthe eye through the thick glass. I think the visitor might have been blind. His \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG052 – Exceptional Risk \n13 \n \neyes were cloudy, but he had no cane or dog and it didn’t seem to affect how \nhe looked at Montauk. Neither of them spoke. \nThe seconds turned into minutes and still they didn’t say a word. They just sat \nthere, staring. Given where I work, it’s really something to be able to say that \nI’ve never seen two people who hated each other as much as Robert Montauk \nand that old man. After a few minutes, I was all but ready to drag him out, but \nas I stepped forward, the lights blew. All of them at once. Leaving us in the \ndark. I heard Pete Gordo, the warder with me on visitor duty, fumbling for the \nhandle on the door to get help or torches. I was tense, ready to fight off \nMontauk if he decided to make a move, but instead a soft voice came from out \nof the darkness. I didn’t recognise it, but I thought it sounded like it came from \nthe old man and I don’t think he was talking to me. \"You didn’t think you could \nkill it for long, did you?\" That’s what it said. \nThen Pete got the door open and a shaft of light poured in from the corridor. I \ncould once again see Montauk and the old man sat there, motionless. It didn’t \nseem like they’d moved an inch, though as I went to take Montauk back to his \ncell, I noticed that he was crying. I didn’t mention it. I’ll be honest, I was kind of \nfreaked out by the whole thing. \nThe next few months were quiet. Montauk seemed even more subdued than \nnormal and often had to be goaded into exercising during his allotted time. The \nonly point where he seemed normal was when his daughter came for her visits \nand maybe that was just because he was already so used to lying to her. That \nwas the summer we had all the plumbing problems in the ERU and the water \nkept going foul, so we were all kind of on edge.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 4, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 4500}}
