She then retrieved a clean scalpel from her cabinet \nand, with a care she had not given the writing, she began to cut through the \ndead woman's back, peeling away the skin upon which she had written and \nleaving behind a small patch of flayed flesh. She hung it, still dripping, upon a \nhook that I hadn't noticed on the wall, then stepped over to the phone and \nmade a call. \nThe ambulance arrived so quickly, I wondered if they had been waiting for her. \nThree men in the uniform of the London ambulance service entered. They \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 062 – First Edition \n \n12 \n \nwore sullen, bitter expressions and exchanged no words with Dr Tillerson as \nthey wrapped the woman in a body bag and took her outside. The doctor \nhanded the oldest of them an envelope that I can only assume contained a \nlarge amount of money, and they left. I'm quite certain they never even went \nnear the hospital. \nIt was now dark outside and I knew that my mother would be worried, but I \ncould not leave unnoticed, nor did I want to while there was still a chance to \nwatch more of this strange ritual. As the skin dried upon its hook, the doctor \nopened the large book and I saw its thick pages were roughly stitched to the \nspine with coarse thread. As she turned those pages, they flopped with an \nunmistakable softness. \nShe stopped at one page, seemingly at random, near the end of the book, and \nbegan to read aloud, her thin finger tracing the lines of text I could not see. As \nshe spoke, I felt the air grow thick and heavy, a scent like wet dirt rolling \nthrough the building and settling in my chest. I don't know exactly when he \nappeared. In fact, even now I'm still not able to pinpoint the moment they \narrive. Like falling asleep, it has simply happened already. The old man who \nnow stood before Dr Tillerson was familiar to me, even though I didn't know \nhis name. One of her patients, I remembered, who'd been taken away in an \nambulance some three weeks before. There he stood, hunched and cowering. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 062 – First Edition \n \n13 \n \nHe spoke in a cracked voice, begging her to release him, demanding to know \nwhat was happening. In return, she was questioning him about his will, about \nhis bank details, or where he had hidden money. \nI couldn't believe it. A power like this and she was using it to try and make \nmoney. It sickened me. It still does. I knew then that she didn't deserve the \nbook. After she dismissed the old man, she collapsed into her desk chair, \nexhausted, and fell asleep. \nI took my father's straight razor from my pocket. It was my most prized \npossession and all I had left of him after he used it to cut his own throat: the \nonly sensible decision he ever made. I crawled from my hiding place so slowly, \nso quietly. She barely even stirred as the blade glided through her windpipe. I \nhad never killed anyone before. I didn't particularly enjoy it. My inclinations, \npredictably, were more toward watching than doing the deed myself. Still, \nthere was some satisfaction in the act. \nI did try to bind her, but it didn't go quite right, and her page was a dreadful \nmess. I can't imagine she enjoys it there at all. It took a lot more practice to get \nit right, not to mention learning Sanskrit, but I got there in the end. After a \nlifetime, I know all its secrets, save one. And I have a pretty good idea about \nhow to find that. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 062 – First Edition \n \n14 \n \nGERTRUDE \nThat does explain why you broke with the Institute. Who does the book come \nfrom? \nMARY \nThe End, of course. I could never truly serve it. I just don't find death that \ninteresting, but I've always found a singular devotion far too restrictive. Just \nask Eric. Or what's left of him. \nGERTRUDE \nWhat about the other book? The smaller one? \nMARY \nOh, just a bit of Vissera. Poems about dying animals, also in Sanskrit. Drops a \nlot of bones. I, I don't even think it has a real title. Pointless really. I eventually \nsold it to Leitner, though it came back to me after the attack. \nGERTRUDE \nI should really tell Elias about this. \nMARY", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 4, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 4282}}
