And it \nwould likely help you move past this unpleasant incident. Some time with a \nmore… qualified care professional might also prove helpful. \nNAOMI Right. I don’t know what I expected, really. \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nWe’ll let you know if we find anything. \n \nNAOMI \nOh, this is ridiculous! I can’t believe I’ve wasted my time. \nJONATHAN SIMS \nStatement ends. \nFollowing Ms. Herne’s statement, we did as much follow-up as we were able, \nwhich admittedly wasn’t a lot. Evan Lukas did indeed pass away from heart \nfailure on March the 22nd 2015, and his body was taken by his family for \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG013 – Alone \n14 \n \nburial. All requests to the Lukas family for information or interviews have been \nvery firmly rebuffed. \nAt roughly one in the morning on the 31st of March, Ms. Herne was involved in \ncollision with one Michael Getty. She had apparently run out into the road in \nfront of Mr. Getty’s car near Wormshill in the Kent Downs. She was quickly \ntaken to a hospital and treated for concussion and dehydration. Her car was \nfound abandoned in a field five miles away. \nThere are no cemeteries matching Ms. Herne’s description anywhere near the \nroad she was found, nor could there have been any fog, given the incredibly \nhigh winds during the storm that night. I’d be tempted to chalk this one up to a \nhallucination from stress and trauma, if it wasn’t for the fact that when she \nwas hit, Ms. Herne was found to be holding a piece of masonry. It appears to \nbe lump of carved granite with an engraved cross design. The size and style \nmatch what would conceivably be found atop a headstone, though we have \nbeen unable to trace its origin. Still attached to it is a small fragment of what \nwe can assume would have been the marker itself. The only text that can be \nmade out simply reads “forgotten”. I’ve arranged for it to be transferred to the \nInstitute’s artefact storage. \nRecording Ends. \n[The Magnus Archives Theme - Outro] \n \nThe Magnus Archives is a podcast distributed by Rusty Quill and licensed under \na creative commons attribution, non-commercial share alike 4.0 international \nlicense.
