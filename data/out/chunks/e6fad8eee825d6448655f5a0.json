What delivery? \nTIM \nAh well, that’s actually what he was asking, huh! Um, apparently Martin, uh, \ntook delivery of a couple of items last week addressed to you. Did he not \nmention it? \nJONATHAN SIMS \nNo, he... Oh, yes, actually. I completely forgot. He said he put it in my desk \ndraw, hold on. \n[SOUND OF PACKAGE BEING RETRIEVED AND OPENED] \nTIM \nEr, what is it? \nJONATHAN SIMS \nA lighter. An old Zippo. \nTIM \nYou smoke? \nJONATHAN SIMS \nNo. And I don’t allow ignition sources in my archive! \nTIM \nOkay. Is there anything unusual about it? \nJONATHAN SIMS \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG036 – Taken Ill \n15 \n \nNot really. Just a sort of spider web design on the front. Doesn’t mean anything \nto me. You? TIM Ah no. No. \nJONATHAN SIMS \nWell… show it to the others, see what they think. You said there was \nsomething else as well? \nTIM \nOh, ah yes, yeah, it was sent straight to the Artefact Storage, a table of some \nsort. Ah, looks old. Quite pretty, though. Fascinating design on it. \nJONATHAN SIMS \nTim… Tim, it doesn’t have a hole in it, does it? About six inches square? \nTIM \nAh… I don’t know. Maybe? Um, I’ll be honest I didn’t really notice. It was \nquite… \nJONATHAN SIMS \nHypnotic, yes. Do you know who made the delivery? Did they sign in? \nTIM \nUm… ah no, ah sorry no I don’t know. \nJONATHAN SIMS \nI need to talk to Martin. Uh, end recording. \n[The Magnus Archives Theme - Outro] \n \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG036 – Taken Ill \n16 \n \nThe Magnus Archives is a podcast distributed by Rusty Quill and licensed under \na creative commons attribution, non-commercial share alike 4.0 international \nlicense.
