He \nremoved his apron, walked to the chair and sat down. His movements were \nsluggish now, uncoordinated, almost like he was drunk. Once in the chair, his \nhuge frame slumped forward and his eyes closed. It looked like he was asleep. \nI should have waited longer, should have made sure he was fast asleep, but I \nwas close to breaking point at this stage and I could think of nothing but \nescape. I opened the locker and walked quickly, silently over to the door and \nopened it. As I did so, the gentle sounds of the street at night filtered through \nfrom the shopfront. Compared to the grim silence of the butcher’s workshop, \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG049 – The Butcher’s Window \n11 \n \nit was beautiful. At least, it was until an ambulance roared past, siren blaring at \nfull volume. \nI heard a roar from behind me and turned to see Jared charging towards me. It \nwas like a strange, lumpy freight train bearing down on me. I tried to close the \ndoor, but I was too slow. Just before it slammed shut, he grabbed my arm and \ntried to pull me back. \nThere is no way to describe what it feels like to have bone pulled out of you \nthrough your unbroken skin. If you’ve ever been stabbed, or had a decent size \nobject embedded in you, maybe you can remember how it felt to have it \nremoved, but even then, the pain is of a different quality. The nerves aren’t \nbeing torn or cut; they’re being pushed aside like water. Imagine the feeling of \nremoving a rubber glove from your hand, but you’re the glove, not the hand, \nand it hurts like the worst toothache you can imagine. That’s as close as I can \nget to putting into words. \nI slammed the door shut and ran into the street, through the people still \nwandering Stockwell in the evening and away, my now empty left arm hanging \nlimply by my side. I didn’t stop running for a very long time. \nI guess in many ways it was a happy ending. The photos, combined with what \nthe police found when they raided the butcher’s shop, were enough to declare \nHector dead, even without the body, and I got my payday from Nicola Laredo. \nThey never did find Jared though. He was long gone when they arrived. The \ndoctors amputated the arm in the end and I’m getting used to the prosthetic, \nbut I can still feel it sometimes, like it’s still there. I know it’s just phantom limb \nsyndrome, but sometimes I swear it feels like my bone’s still out there, twisting \nin someone else’s arm. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG049 – The Butcher’s Window \n12 \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nStatement ends. \nI don’t think it’s unreasonable to assume this butcher to be Jared Hopworth. It \nseems that if Mr Adekoya’s account from statement #9991006 is accurate, \nthen Hopworth has found new ways to profit from his abilities in the eight \nyears since his acquisition of The Boneturner’s Tale. The book itself is \nconspicuously absent from this account, though it may simply mean Hopworth \nno longer needs to keep it with him. No idea about the pit though – that’s new. \nIts description puts me in mind of some of the more... ‘meaty’ statements, but \nthere isn’t enough evidence to make any direct connections. \nMr Pryor was unavailable for a follow-up interview as he emigrated to New \nZealand in 2013, following a four-year jail term for tax evasion. He seems to \nhave largely dropped off the map. Nicola Laredo confirmed the basic details of \nthe job she had given to Mr Pryor, although she was unaware of any of the \nmore gruesome aspects of her husband’s murder. At least she was until Martin \ninterviewed her. I should warn Elias to expect another complaint. \nThe police aspect of this statement has been the hardest to follow up. Sasha \nhas recently been having problems with her normal backdoor access to police \nrecords, as despite IT’s best efforts, her computer has broken yet again, \nmaking this the third time in the last two months. Until we can source some \nmore reliable equipment, we may have to rely on other methods. \nBasira has refused to compromise her position any further, so we’re having to \nrely on Tim’s involvement with certain staff at the police records office. \nApparently, he is involved both with one of the young ladies there, as well as \nthe gentleman who manages the other shift.
