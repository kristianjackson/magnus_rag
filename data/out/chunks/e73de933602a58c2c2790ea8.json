It was still \npartially bound in the tight burial cloth, but that didn't stop it making its \npainstaking way over the dusty ground. There was plenty of room to run \naround it, it wasn't even that fast, but my legs just wouldn't work as it got \ncloser and closer. Its mouth opened and closed stiffly, dark brown dust falling \nfrom it in a steady stream. I have no idea how it knew I was there. It had no \neyes, no nose. There's no way it should have been able to detect me, but it \nknew, and crawled directly towards me. \nI managed to reach to my hip and pull out my own weapon, a large hunting \nknife I'd picked up on our last trip to North America, more because its weight \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 064 – Burial Rites \n \n12 \n \nhad given me a sense of security than because I knew how to use it. I waved it \nat the approaching corpse, but there was no reaction. When I felt its cold, \nleathery fingers grip my shin, it was like the panic pushed my mind so far that it \nsuddenly snapped back into place. I gripped the knife in both hands, leaned \nforward and plunged it into the thing's throat. \nThe blade sank in with a dry creaking sound and the mummy's arm shot up to \ngrip it. I almost threw up from the feeling of its blackened, dead hands on \nmine, but it was astoundingly strong. Twitching, it pulled my hands away, \ndragging the knife out of its throat and moving my arm down lower, \npositioning the point of the blade on its chest, where the heart should be. Then \nit made me push the knife in. The poor creature hung there for a second, then \npulled the knife out and made me stab it again. Over and over it made me do \nit, while its torso wracked and convulsed. It almost seemed like it was crying, \nbut without tear ducts or lungs there was no way to know. \nAfter the fifth time it had made me stab it, it loosened its grip on my hand \nenough that I could release the knife. With a burst of adrenaline, I took to my \nfeet and fled. Luckily, Stavo hadn't withdrawn the jeep's winch cable yet, or \nelse God knows how long I'd have been trapped down there, especially since \nwhen I emerged into the intense sunlight of the desert, I found Paul and Barry \narguing over the best way to replace the slab over the entrance. It took many \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 064 – Burial Rites \n \n13 \n \nhours to re-bury it completely, but when we were done, it was like no one had \never been there. Stavo didn't say a word as we drove away. \nIn ancient Egypt, dying was the most important thing a person would ever do. \nYour whole life was preparation for it, readying yourself and acquiring what \nyou would need for the journey. Back then the Nile was the source of all that \nkept you alive. The land of the living. But as you got further from it, the very \nearth itself became hostile to you, unable to support any sort of life at all. It \nwas there, at the outskirts, the edge of life itself, that they built their tombs \nand pyramids. I cannot imagine what they would have thought of a person \nwho could not die. I can imagine what they would have done to them. \nARCHIVIST \nEnd statement. \nIf there's one thing that I hate more than statements that can only be followed \nup by making contact with uncooperative foreign agencies, it is statements \nwhere everyone involved is a criminal who either cannot be tracked down or is \nunwilling to discuss their business in any way. This statement manages to \nneatly combine the two in such a way that any verification or follow up has \nproven utterly impossible. The only thing I have found is that Ms Gwynne is \nnow training to become a teacher. I can't deny I find a certain cruel satisfaction \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 064 – Burial Rites \n \n14 \n \nin that fact. I feel anyone who brings me a statement about mummies deserves \neverything they get. \nEnd recording. \n[Tape clicks off. Tape clicks on.] \nBASIRA \nYou can't just come down to the station asking after me. \nARCHIVIST \nI'm sorry, I didn't think. \nBASIRA \nNo, you didn't. Now I've got a whole bunch of questions being asked. They're \nkeeping tabs on me at work. \nARCHIVIST \nI just wanted to see— \nBASIRA \nThe next tape. Yeah, I get it. But right now, I can't do anything about that, \nbecause I feel like they're watching me all the time.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 5, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 4278}}
