A bayonet gouge scored through the soft and \nsodden mud for uncounted miles. \n[Hissing static ends] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nA trench that marks the front line of a war that has no name. It has always \nbeen raging, deep in the hearts of the powerful and those that thirst to see \nbodies piled high in their name. And now it has a battleground. A thousand \npointless conflicts and bitter stalemates stitched together like a triaged chest \nwound. It is a butchered border, a thin and punctured membrane between the \nunending meat grinder and the terrified victims it longs for. You may find this \ntrench reaching all across the world, and it will never stop, never be satisfied, \nnever think of peace. \nCharlie stands there, waiting in a transport. Once, it was a thin metal landing \ncraft, drifting slowly through a fetid lake. The waters were red and black by \nturns with blood and oil and the floating bodies of those before them, that \nwere pushed aside by the boat’s wake. Next to him, Charlie saw Ryan, who \nhe’d known since childhood, though the other details were hazy. Ryan gave \nhim a thumbs up and an encouraging smile, before his face exploded inwards \nto a sniper’s bullet, peppering the boat with shards of bone and gore. Charlie \nswallowed, and waited as the bullets kept coming and those around him died \nbut did not fall, propped up as they were by the pressing mass of people \naround them. He could not move, and as he waited for the shot that would \ntake him, his legs fell away in fear. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 163 – In the Trenches \n13 \nNow he is in a helicopter, strapped in tight and unable to move. The man in the \ngunner’s chair is dead, bound limp in his seat harness, half his jaw gone. The \nthump-thump-thump of the rotors pulses through Charlie like a toothache, and \nhe cannot hear the shouts and cries of his comrades. He looks out of the side \nas a tell-tale line of smoke arcs up and around towards them from the \nscorched earth far below. He cannot hear his own scream. \nHe lies upon the ground, amid the twisted wreckage of whatever he was \ntrapped in, feeling the jagged shards of broken bone dig into him. Charlie looks \nup, and sees something floating there, silently. It is sleek, and merciless, its \nfeatureless carbon-fibre face regarding the shattered man dispassionately. The \ndrone’s camera blinks once, twice as he tries desperately to crawl away, pain \nlancing through every part of him. The thing makes no sound as it follows him, \nmatching the excruciating pace of the bleeding soldier. Charlie knows when it \ndecides to fire, he won’t even hear it. \nHe places his hand down and it sinks, suddenly, into the mud. He cries out as \nthe rusted barbed wire curls itself eagerly around his wrist, digging into his \nskin. Tasting fear, more wire slithers through the churned earth towards him, \nstretching and gripping him tight, rough needles puncturing his legs and chest \nand throat, pulling him down and holding him steady as the drone lingers, its \nblankness giving no hint of the thoughts behind its trigger. \nThere is a rumbling in the earth around him as a tank speeds along its \nunstoppable path, and Charlie is immediately pulled under its tread. He has a \nmoment of shocked horror, before being reduced to a smear in the mud. \nInside the tank, Ishaan screams. \nIshaan remembers the recruiters. He was promised valour, and camaraderie, \nand the chance to be part of something meaningful. He knew that part had", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 2, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 4256}}
