I could see myself becoming one of these \npeople and I fought very hard against the feeling of wrongness that seemed to \nbe trying to worm itself into my mind. I forced myself to pay Daniel some \nvague compliment about the variety of his pieces as he lit another cigarette. I \nconsidered mentioning the smoking ban, but that wasn’t really why I was \nthere, so I just started talking about money laundering instead. He nodded and \nsaid he’d had the letter announcing the inspection and had got all the accounts \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 054 – Still Life \n6 \n \nand transactions for the past few years ready for me. He explained that, as \nhe’d only taken over the business very recently, he wasn’t aware of much in \nthe way of anti-money laundering policies or procedures. This was music to my \nears, as there’s very little I enjoy more than taking an engaged new business \nowner through the basics, and in a few minutes, I’d forgotten all the glassy \neyes that seemed to follow me round the room. At least mostly. \nDaniel seemed remarkably interested when I outlined basic checks and due \ndiligence, but it wasn’t the first time. People, especially new business owners, \ntend to sit up and take notice when HMRC turns up for a visit. I mean, I try not \nto exploit my position, but people take a visit from the taxman very seriously \nand it can produce some wonderfully attentive audiences. Daniel didn’t seem \npanicked or worried though, simply intrigued. He asked all the right questions \nand was always ready with a good example for any of the more abstract \naspects of the discussion. All in all, he was a real pleasure to discuss money \nlaundering with. \nI’d even stopped noticing the smell after a while, though I’d become aware of \nit again whenever he started another cigarette, something that usually \nhappened almost immediately after he finished his last one. I can’t even \nimagine what his lungs must have looked like. The only thing that was a touch \nawkward was that he seemed determined to avoid eye contact, looking at the \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 054 – Still Life \n7 \n \nfloor or the taxidermied animals, but never directly at me. It was a little bit \ndisconcerting, but I have a cousin with autism, so it wasn’t an entirely new \nsituation to me. \nEventually the discussion ended and Daniel talked through some of the \npotential policies he was going to put in place. They actually seemed a bit \nexcessive, given that he was only the person currently employed at The Trophy \nRoom, but I certainly wasn’t going to tell him to be less careful. I then asked if I \ncould have a look at his books and he nodded again and took me through to \nthe back room. \nThe office behind the main shop was small and very clean. Most of the space \nwas taken up by a large oak desk and I could see another door leading through \nto what seemed to be a workshop, judging by the tables and bags of sawdust. \nDaniel handed me his account books, bank records and receipts and left me to \nit. None of it had been digitised and I could tell it was going to take me a long \ntime to get through it all. The smell was fainter here though, so it wasn’t quite \nas dreadful as it might have been. \nThere was taxidermy in this room as well, though different to the ones out \nfront. Hung along the back walls were pelts and treated animal skins. They \nlooked very old.
