People you thought you could \ncount on? \n(Short thinking exhales from Martin) \nMARTIN \nI mean... I-I worry about it, but, but, actu-actually, no? Not like a full-blown \nbetrayal or anything. \nARCHIVIST \nI'm glad. Because this place focuses on that worry, that fear of your own pack \nturning their claws on you. \nMARTIN \nHm. Is that... really a Hunt thing? \nARCHIVIST \nCan be. The old divisions don't mean as much these days. Maybe they never \ndid. The domains are... smaller, more, personal than the powers. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 176 – Blood Ties \n6 \nThey don't just feed on the worst fears of the people trapped there; they're \nshaped by them, too. It's enough to fear the domain itself, if not the entire \npower behind it. \nMARTIN \nHm. \nYou should get that on a mug. ‘You don't have to fear the Hunt to be trapped \nhere...’ \nARCHIVIST \n(Humourless) But it helps. \nMARTIN \nLook, so can we, just, move on? \n[He takes a step] \nARCHIVIST \nSoon. \nMARTIN \nLook, John, I, I didn't want to say this, but we either need to move on or you \nneed to tell me what's going on because… \nI think we're being followed. \nARCHIVIST \n(Agreeing) We are. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 176 – Blood Ties \n7 \nMARTIN \nOh. 'Kay. That's not what I wanted to actually hear. \nARCHIVIST \nI know, that's why I didn't mention it before. \nMARTIN \n(Under his breath) Oh my god… \nBut we're safe, right? \nARCHIVIST \nAs long as you remain calm, yes, absolutely. \n(Beat) \nMARTIN \nSo-so are you… going to tell me what's going on? What the plan is? \nARCHIVIST \nWe're going to find Basira. \nMARTIN \n(Annoyed but still hushed) No, John, that's the goal. Wh-what I want is the \nplan, the steps in between that need us to be hunted through the woods. I'm \nflying blind here, I'm— \n[A cry from a bird of prey] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 176 – Blood Ties \n8 \nARCHIVIST \nYeah. I'm sorry. I do know what I'm doing. \nMARTIN \nHow nice for you, but I don't, unless you tell me! How, how are we even going \nto approach Basira? \nARCHIVIST \nIt's tricky, she's, (sighing) she's had a bad time. \nMARTIN \n(Slight scoff) I mean, haven't we all? \nARCHIVIST \nNo. No, we haven't. \n(Beat) \nMARTIN \nRight. \nARCHIVIST \nIf we approach her directly, she's likely to bolt. And she can move a lot quicker \nthan we can. \nMARTIN \nUm, yeah, okay, but I'm still not hearing a plan as such. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 176 – Blood Ties \n9 \nARCHIVIST \nAh— \nMARTIN \nWhat? \nARCHIVIST \nUh— Hold on. \nMARTIN \nOh my god, are you actually serious, right now? \nARCHIVIST \nI'm sorry! \n(Martin makes a short annoyed sigh) \nMARTIN \nFine. Just — I'll keep a lookout, be quick. \nARCHIVIST \nI'll do my best. \n[Martin walks away] \n[Hissing static starts] \nARCHIVIST \nFeet pound silent whisper silent blood on lips blood on teeth blood scent of \nhated prey flows through veins and into feet pound silent in pursuit.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 1, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 3021}}
