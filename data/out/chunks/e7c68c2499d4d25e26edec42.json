She carried a large canvas bag, and was shaking her head, telling the \nold man to leave me alone. After a few suspicious glances, he got up. I could \nswear I recognised him from somewhere, but when I asked the two of them \nwho they were, they just shook their heads and told me to leave. I asked them \nwhat was going on, and the old man looked at his companion, as if asking \npermission, said something about knowledge being a good defence here. She \nshook her head and said that leaving quickly was a better one. I didn’t need to \nbe told a third time. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG036 – Taken Ill \n12 \n \nI got in my car, and I left them to their work. I didn’t turn around even when I \nsaw the smoke start to rise behind me. And that was the last time I went there. \nNow, if you’ll excuse me, I need to go wash my hands. \nJONATHAN SIMS \nStatement ends. \nThe Ivy Meadows Care Home in Woodley was officially decommissioned in July \n2011, a month before the first of these alleged calls came in. It burned down \non the 4th of September that same year after a leaking gas main caught fire. If \nthe gas was already leaking, this might have resulted in hallucinations or other \nproblems during their initial visit. There is no record of the body of Bertrand \nMiller being processed, or cremated, by Baxter and Gordon Funeral Directors, \nbut based on this statement that’s not necessarily a point of incredulity. \nBertrand Miller was a resident at Ivy Meadows, but according to his death \ncertificate he passed away on 19th July, a week before the home was \ndecommissioned. There’s no record of any funeral arrangements or disposal of \nthe body. \nIn fact, it seems the records from the closure of Ivy Meadows are... well, \naccording to Sasha, calling them ‘patchy’ would be very generous. There are \nonly transfer records for seven residents, whereas at last official count the \nhome held twenty-nine. The others seem to have been lost in the system \nsomewhere. The majority of the workforce also appears to be undocumented, \nand I can find no record of any ‘Alenka Kozel’ on the system. Martin’s research \nwould seem to indicate the place employed a reasonable number of \ninternational staff they preferred to keep off the books, but it doesn’t explain \nwhy none of the officially-listed staff can be located for followup, except for \nHannah Ramirez, whose brief interview simply established she moved to \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG036 – Taken Ill \n13 \n \nBrighton shortly before the closure of Ivy Meadows and hadn’t heard anything \nabout it since. John Amherst, as best we can tell, doesn’t exist. We’re unable to \nlocate anyone fitting that description anywhere within the care or medical \nsector, and he certainly never ran any nursing homes. \nAnother tale full of dead ends. We did contact the Baxters. Joshua Baxter \nrepeated the first part of the above statement. George Baxter told us not to \nlisten to tall tales. Nicole Baxter said she stands by her account, but aside from \nlosing her left hand in what she calls “a workplace accident”, there have been \nno further developments. \nStill, there’s a lot here the puts me in mind of other statements. Something in \nthe way Ms. Baxter talks about fear. I can’t help but be reminded of statement \n0142302, how Jane Prentiss talks about her own fears. And the old man and his \ncompanion… who does that remind me of? If he wasn’t dead I’d think it might \nhave been Trevor… \n[Door opens] \nJONATHAN SIMS \nOh, er, yes? \nTIM \nAre you free? \nJONATHAN SIMS \nYes... Yes, I’m just about finished here, what is it? \nTIM \nOh, ah, nothing urgent, um, it’s just Elias was asking a couple questions about \nthe delivery. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG036 – Taken Ill \n14 \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nDelivery? What delivery? \nTIM \nAh well, that’s actually what he was asking, huh! Um, apparently Martin, uh, \ntook delivery of a couple of items last week addressed to you. Did he not \nmention it? \nJONATHAN SIMS \nNo, he... Oh, yes, actually. I completely forgot. He said he put it in my desk \ndraw, hold on. \n[SOUND OF PACKAGE BEING RETRIEVED AND OPENED] \nTIM \nEr, what is it? \nJONATHAN SIMS \nA lighter. An old Zippo. \nTIM \nYou smoke? \nJONATHAN SIMS \nNo. And I don’t allow ignition sources in my archive! \nTIM \nOkay. Is there anything unusual about it? \nJONATHAN SIMS", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 6, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 4430}}
