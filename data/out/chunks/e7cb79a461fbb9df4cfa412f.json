I assumed it would be about a circus or, uh...? \nXIAOLING \nI have not read it, but I would be surprised. I seriously doubt there were any \ncircuses at the time.

How can unspeakable carnage become so tired and repetitive? \nEven the most trite and poorly written of the penny bloods would, at least, \nmake some show of a plot, or a purpose to the horror and the suffering.
