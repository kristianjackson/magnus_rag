I’m sure it’s hard to accept for \nanyone, even an organisation such as yourselves, but I do not have proof to \ngive you except for the vampire teeth that I will leave with this statement. Do \nnot feel bad about reporting me to the police for the murders, as I am sure you \nmust, since I have recently received a diagnosis of late-stage lung cancer and it \nis doubtful I will be living much longer anyway. That is the main reason for \nfinally putting down on paper the details of the mission I have been secretly \nundertaking for the last half a century. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG010 – Vampire Killer \n3 \n \nI killed my first vampire in 1959. At that point I was still living a mostly normal \nlife, save perhaps for the abuse my family was subject to from my father. He \nwas a vile man who ended up killing my mother in ’56. It was a clear-cut case \nof drunken murder but the courts ruled it as an accident and my father stayed \nout of jail. Luckily, myself and my brother only had to endure four months of \nunpleasantness from him before he finally finished drinking himself to death. I \nwas thirteen when he finally died and my brother was fifteen. Following his \ndeath, there were several attempts to rehome us as orphans but they always \nsplit us up, and we couldn’t be doing with that, so we’d generally run away. \nAfter a while it became so we were happier finding our way on the streets than \nin another stranger’s home. \nIt was in autumn of 1959 that we were taken in by Sylvia McDonald. It wasn’t \nany sort of official fostering agreement, but it was getting to be quite cold at \nthe end of October and it just saw us shivering in a side street next to the Kings \nArms Hotel, as it was back then, on Tipping Street before the ring road took it \nover. Looking back I believe it to have been visiting the pub for the purposes of \nlocating down and outs for use as victims and in my brother and myself, I must \nsay, it successfully found some. It looked like an older woman, a widow I \nassumed, from the way it dressed in black and had a strange manner, which I \nnow know to be the mark of the vampire, but back then I paid no attention to \nit. Many of the older folks had lived through both wars and it was not \nuncommon for them to be somewhat strange. I thought this was the case with \nSylvia McDonald and after a small amount of discussion my brother and I \nagreed to the offer of food and shelter. \nLet me say a little bit about the vampire’s manner, because once I taught \nmyself to read I read as much on the subject as I could and it isn’t covered", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 1, "chunk_count": 10, "chars": 2707}}
