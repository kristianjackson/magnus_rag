Namely, that my television and computer had already been \nsent over to my sister’s place, and without any signal, I was left with pretty \nmuch two options: sit doing nothing and listen to the rain, or head out into it. I \nopened the door for about three seconds before I decided that sitting and \nwaiting was the better choice. \nI walked upstairs, pulled a seat to the window overlooking the road, and I sat \nthere, watching. The drains were already starting to flood, puddles growing \naround the parked cars, reaching up and over, eager to meet in the middle, to \nturn from a pool of water into something much more. I expected cars, maybe \npeople running desperately to their homes, but the street outside was quiet, \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 129 – Submerged \n11 \n \nsave for the pounding of the downpour. Ten minutes, twenty, half an hour \npassed, and I didn’t see a single soul. Not a car or a bike, not even a bus. That \nstarted to worry me a bit. The 394 should pass by every fifteen minutes or so, \nbut I definitely hadn’t seen it. Did they know something I didn’t? Was there \nsome sort of weather warning out that I’d missed, for Hackney? \nThat was when I heard the first peal of thunder. There was no lightening, I \nwant to be very clear on that, nothing broke the uniform iron grey of the sky, \ndark and solid as far as I could see. But the thunder hit like a hammer. It rolled, \ndeeper than I had heard even in the most violent of storms, and it just kept \ngoing. I could feel it shaking through my whole body, and for a moment, I \nthought I was wrong and that it must have been a proper earthquake. Then it \nfaded and the world was silent again, save for the impact of the rain. When my \nwatch told me it was nine o’clock, I dragged myself over to the mattress and \ntold myself I might as well sleep through the rest of the storm, even though \nthe sky seemed no darker than before. I tried to relax, to let the rhythmic \ntapping of the rain lull me off to sleep, like it always had when I was a boy, but \nI could find no comfort in it. It sounded too much like it wanted to get in. \nThe thunder woke me: another long, deep roar that seemed to come as much \nfrom the ground as it did the clouds. The rain still hammered down outside and \nI checked my watch, staring at it in confusion. It didn’t make any sense. It said \nit was three AM, the middle of the night, but looking out through the window, \nthe world was still light. The sky was cloudy and grey, as it had been the \nprevious day, and the rain made it impossible to see further than the end of \nthe street. But all the same, it definitely wasn’t night. There were no \nstreetlights turned on and, now that I looked for it, I couldn’t see any windows", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 3, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 2846}}
