How? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 195 – Adrift \n \n11 \nARCHIVIST \nI think she’s taking him to Hill Top Road, and... I don’t know, I just— I needed \nsomeone I could trust, and I couldn’t ask Georgie or Melanie to come all this \nway, so— \nBASIRA \nThey’re alive? \nARCHIVIST \nOh, uh, y-yes, I, um… \nBASIRA \nOh, it’s, it’s fine, you can catch me up later. Let’s focus on the Martin situation. \nARCHIVIST \nRight. \nBASIRA \nCan you, y’know, ‘see’ him? \nARCHIVIST \nNo. A-Annabelle has a— Sh-She can block The Eye. There’s a, a camera. It’s an \nartefact that was protecting Salesa’s— Right. So, um, shortly after we left you \nwe found a— \nBASIRA \nMagic camera that keeps them hidden. Got it. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 195 – Adrift \n \n12 \nARCHIVIST \nYeah. \nBASIRA \nSo they’re at Hill Top Road? \nARCHIVIST \nYes. \nBASIRA \nAnd you’re sure? Even if you can’t see them? \nARCHIVIST \nYes. \nBASIRA \nAnd you know the way? \nARCHIVIST \nYes. \nBASIRA \nSo what are we waiting for? Stop messing around, let’s go. \nARCHIVIST \n(Irritated) I’m not messing ar— Right. Of course. \n[Long moments pass with the Archivist’s audible exertions and slow \nrowing technique] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 195 – Adrift \n \n13 \nBASIRA \nIt’s lucky for me you needed help. I just got out of this weird mirror-maze \nthing, and then I was just... on an island. I was seriously considering swimming. \n[The deep pulsing sound from the behemoth fades in] \nARCHIVIST \nThat would not have been a good idea. \n[Suddenly the boat is jostled from beneath, rippling water and \nsplashes until it settles; the behemoth sounds are gone] \n(Small gasp from Basira) \n[Th Archivist restarts rowing, post-jostling] \nBASIRA \nI don’t remember there being a huge lake between London and Oxford. \nARCHIVIST \nThat’s because there wasn’t one. \nBASIRA \nRight. \nI’m a bit over the whole horror-geography thing at this point. \nARCHIVIST \nThat makes two of us. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 195 – Adrift \n \n14 \nBASIRA \nSo I’m guessing it represents academic isolation or something? Maybe \nsomething to do with ‘the dangerous unknown’, skimming to the surface, that \nkind of thing? \nARCHIVIST \n(Weary) Maybe it just represents the feeling of sore arms. \nBASIRA \nBeen rowing a while, then? \nARCHIVIST \nHard to say. Certainly feels that way. \nBASIRA \nYeah, you look like crap. \nARCHIVIST \nThanks. \nBASIRA \nYou’re welcome. \nARCHIVIST \nI’m trying to think of it as a metaphor. \nBASIRA \nAnd that helps? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 195 – Adrift \n \n15 \nARCHIVIST \nNot at all. \nI’d be more than happy to let you take over, if you’d like? \nBASIRA \nNo, I wouldn’t want to cramp your style. \nARCHIVIST \nAt this point, that’s just about the only part of me that isn’t cramping. \nBASIRA \nAlright, give ‘em here. \n[The Archivist transfers the oars to Basira, who begins rowing at a \nfaster pace than The Archivist] \nARCHIVIST \nHere you go. \nBASIRA \nOkay. So... what do we know about Hill Top Road? \nARCHIVIST \nNot much. \nBASIRA \nAnother blind spot? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 195 – Adrift \n \n16 \nARCHIVIST \nNo, it’s— I could look at it, but it... it was… it was like a… a hole. You know that \nfeeling you get when you look down from a, a great height, like you’re being \npulled into the abyss? \nBASIRA \nKind of? \nARCHIVIST \n(Getting lost in thought) Well it was… was like that. Normally I can see it, see \nthe… webs, and feel the power of The Spider emanating from it, but… as I \nwould look... it’s like my mind…. follows the paths of The Web… \n[Hissing static starts] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nthe strands going down and… out… \n(Catching self) It’s quite disorientating. \n[Hissing static ends] \nBASIRA \nSo what? It’s like a… a Web-Vast team-up? \nARCHIVIST \nAlmost, but… no. It… It’s different. Something else. Either way the important \nthing is that right now, I can’t see it at all. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 195 – Adrift \n \n17 \nBASIRA \nSo we know they’re there with the magic camera. \nARCHIVIST \nExactly. \nBASIRA \n(Sighs) And we’re charging off into the unknown again? It’s just like old times. \nARCHIVIST \nOld times wasn’t actually all that long ago. \nBASIRA \nHmm. True. Feels it, though doesn’t it? \nARCHIVIST \nWell, hopefully this one will go a bit better. \nBASIRA \nWould be hard for it to go worse. \nARCHIVIST \nYeah. \n(Beat) \nSo… how was the trip down?
