I took a step back in shock, \nand my feet hit the wall behind me. The passage was getting narrower, though \nI could not see any movement. I stood completely still and for several seconds \nthere was silence. Then, from somewhere in the darkness, I heard a single \nword, clear as day: “Leave.” \nIt was spoken simply, without intonation or threat. Just a command. \nSo I did. I began to shuffle back as quickly as possible the way I had come, \nkeeping my eyes open as long as I could, as every time I closed them the wall \nseemed to get even closer. By the time I reached the stairs back up, it had \nalmost pinned me. I fled back up the stairs, followed the arrows I had left back \nto the trapdoor. It took me barely ten minutes, but I was moving faster than I \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG041 – Too Deep \n11 \n \nwould have thought possible in those… cramped tunnels. I locked the trapdoor \nbehind me, and placed the heaviest objects I could find on it. \nI have not been below the Institute since then. It took no small amount of \nconsideration to decide I should officially make a statement. I did not think to \nbring the tape recorder with me. I suppose I’ve gotten out of the habit during \nmy recuperation. I am no closer to determining what is lurking down there \nthan I was when I started. If anything I have more questions. Why point me \ndownwards, only to then demand I run back? Was it some sort of trap? A test? \nI don’t know, but right now, finding whatever secrets might be lurking in those \ntunnels is my primary concern. \nEnd recording. \n[CLICK] \n[CLICK] \nJONATHAN SIMS \nSupplemental. \nI don’t care about the tunnels, or the secrets they might hide. That’s not \nstrictly true, I suppose. I do have a burning curiosity as to what is down there, \nbut my primary focus must be on who killed Gertrude Robinson, and I do not \nbelieve for a moment that it was a wall-moving spectre from the depths of the \nearth. No, far more likely it’s one of my colleagues. Elias is a prime suspect, but \nit could have been any of them. \nI have told Martin the second tape recorder was lost in the attack. Having two \nmeans I can make two tapes from each recording. One containing the main \nstatement and notes, which will be stored in the archive, and the other \ncontaining the statement, notes, and… this supplement, which will chronicle \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG041 – Too Deep \n12 \n \nmy own investigations. These tapes will be hidden. If you’re hearing this, I \nassume you’re my replacement, following my death or disappearance, and \nhave received instructions on where to find them. \nI have little more to add to this initial account, as I have only recently returned \nto my position in full, and haven’t had time to begin personal investigations. \nMy statement was, of course, completely true, though I have deliberately \noverstated my interest in the tunnels. If my colleagues believe that to be my \nmain focus, they may let their guard down. This level of paranoia is new to me, \nbut I’m learning fast. Trust can get you killed. \nEnd supplement. \n[The Magnus Archives Theme - Outro] \n \nThe Magnus Archives is a podcast distributed by Rusty Quill and licensed under \na creative commons attribution, non-commercial share alike 4.0 international \nlicense.
