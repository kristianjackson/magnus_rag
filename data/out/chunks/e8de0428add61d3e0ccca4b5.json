Behind Gerard I \nsaw bottles of saline solution start to bubble and boil. I stepped aside. He \nnodded in appreciation and said something that I remember very clearly, even \nthough it still makes no sense. He said, “Yes. For you, better beholding than the \nlightless flame”. \nI didn’t try to stop him as he walked back into the ward. I just stood there and \nwatched as he took out the scalpel, muttered some words I couldn’t make out, \nand plunged the blade into the centre of the chanting man’s throat. At that \nmoment there was the sound of sizzling and a smell like rotten meat on a grill. I \nwatched as the flesh around that wound began to blacken and crack, the \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG012 – First Aid \n10 \n \nbandages curled and disintegrated, and the scorched skin spread over his body \nlike water. There was no fire and I felt no heat, but over the course of twenty \nseconds I watched this man’s body cremate itself to ash. Even the scalpel was \ngone. \nGerard Keay walked over to the bed and, picking up the empty bedpan \nbeneath it, gently swept the ashes into the metal basin and handed it to me, \nasking me to dispose of it. I took it and numbly walked out, heading towards a \nmedical waste bin. As I walked the corridor, I noticed a figure at the other end. \nIt was Doctor Grice. I’m not ashamed to admit that I wept in relief as I ran to \nthe waiting room and saw it once again full of people complaining and \nmoaning to themselves. By the time I was finished and got back to the room, \nGerard was lying in his own bed, apparently sleeping. I considered asking him \nnow what had happened, but at that moment another ambulance arrived with \nthree members of a Christmas party that had gotten dangerously out of hand, \nand just like that, the rest of my shift was gone. \nGerard Keay was treated for a further four days in the hospital before being \ndischarged into the care of his mother. I tried to talk to him about what \nhappened, but he was on a lot of painkillers and never seemed to really \nregister I was there. It may have been feigned, I suppose, but in the end the \nresult was the same. Since then I’ve just tried not to think about it. I’ve \nmanaged to get almost thirty years of nursing under my belt before something \nlike this happened, so with any luck I’ll be long retired by the time anything like \nit happens again. \nI worry sometimes, though. Over the last few months, when I’m alone on the \nwards, I get the feeling I’m being watched. Not threatened or judged, just \nwatched. I avoid that storeroom, particularly. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG012 – First Aid \n11 \n \n[Main Body of Statement] \nJONATHAN SIMS \nStatement ends. \nThere’s obviously a lot to unpack here, so let’s start with what is provable. \nSasha managed to get access to the hospital records for this period and they \ndo list the admission of Gerard Keay and an unknown male for burn injuries \nsimilar to what Ms. Saraki described. Furthermore, there are only discharge \npapers for Gerard Keay and a short police report on the disappearance of the \nsecond burn victim. No evidence of foul play was found and no official missing \npersons case was ever opened. \nAs far as the mystery man’s chanting goes, if it was indeed “Asag” that he was \nsaying, then that’s quite interesting. Asag is the name of a demon in Sumerian \nmythology associated with disease and corruption, which doesn’t really seem \nto have much relevance to this statement except that it was also fabled that \nAsag was able to boil fish alive in their rivers. Admittedly in Sumerian myth this \nwas because he was monstrously ugly but a curious coincidence nonetheless. \n“Veepalach” might also be a mishearing of the Polish word “wypalać”, \naccording to Martin, which means to cauterize or brand. Admittedly, if Martin \nspeaks Polish in the same way he “speaks Latin” then he might be talking \nnonsense again, but I’ve looked it up and it appears to check out. I can’t find \nanything conclusive on the phrase “the lightless flame” however; it crops up in \na lot of different contexts throughout various esoteric literatures. \nIt has not escaped my notice that this is the second time Gerard Keay has \nturned up in this Archive. I’d be very keen to get his statement, but \nunfortunately it looks like he passed away from a brain tumour late last year.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 6, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 4341}}
