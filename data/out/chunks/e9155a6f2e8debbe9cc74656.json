But she \nstrains and shakes and fears the wind that pushes and bends the brittle \nstiffness of the bones. It takes every drop of her strength to keep herself aloft, \nto not collapse in a heap of splintered femur and broken rib. There is no \nmoment of her new existence that is not a shuddering, terrified effort. She is \nbeautiful. And she cannot allow herself to lose that at any cost. She cannot \nshatter into fleshly ugliness again. \nThe Bone Rose, properly cultivated, will be a fearful and wonderful centrepiece \nfor a carefully tended mortal garden. \nCultivation notes for Secarium Leopold, commonly known as the Cutaway \nTulip. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 171 – The Gardener \n12 \nAt the edges of the mortal garden, if one is lucky, one may find the rare \nCutaway Tulip, the pride of any diligent gardener. While easy to grow to a \nsmall size with some casually applied insecurities, to create a true masterpiece \nof carved and peeled and sculpted flesh requires a lengthy and involved \ncultivation. \nEnsuring a properly grotesque blossom, an elegant and graceful flowering, is \nmore in the pruning than in the preparation. The soil can be anything mulched \nin hostility to self-worth, and the light and temperature must simply be kept at \na level to allow the appropriate growth of an obsession. \nAn obsession, with the changing and hacking of itself, that from stem to root to \npetal it cuts and breaks and sticks itself into ever new configurations and \nshapes, each a new summit of repulsive symmetry and stomach-churning \nperfection. A perfection sought in the blade and the shears of the gardener. Or \nthe edge wielded by its own wildly waving roots, eagerly digging into a knotted \nand knitted form and pulling itself apart. \nThe Cutaway Tulip's growth is less reliant than other blooms on the moment-\nto-moment terror of themselves, the sharpened, pointed fear of a form you \nare appalled to look upon. Instead, what must be grown and fed and watered \nis the lingering, nagging dread of falling short of what could be. At the final, \nglorious culmination that a body may someday achieve, the ever-retreating \nperfections that sit always on the tip of a knife. \nBut also growing with the flower must be that other dread: Not of perfection \nto be hunted, but of decay to be fled. The wrinkled, greying translucent marks \nof encroaching mortality, a body that seeks to turn all that looks like you into a \nmouldering parody. And the fearful slicing and desperate stabbing that is no \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 171 – The Gardener \n13 \nlonger to seek the golden promise of an eternal beauty but a tearful attempt \nto rewind a spring that ticks itself ever looser with every snap of the clock face. \nLeopold is aware of what he has become, of the bleeding, twitching caricature \nof a human body he inhabits, the ribbons of himself that are pruned and \nbroken and woven into dazzling petals. But as much as he is scared to his roots \nof the next form the shears will chop him into, even more he fears the \nspreading stagnation that moves through his stem like rot, the start of a \ndecline that can only be postponed by the mutilating torments of his gardener. \nHe would cry, but he has no idea where his tear ducts are anymore. \nWhile initially a very intensive and time-consuming flower to grow, a well-\ncared for Cutaway Tulip can stand as a torn and wretched testament to the \ngardener's skill, especially if successfully brought to the point where it begins \nto operate and dissect itself. \nCultivation notes for Supramium Maeve. Commonly known as the Lily of the \nDamned. \nWhile a somewhat difficult flower to acquire the seeds for, the actual growing \nof a Lily of the Damned is a task that requires remarkably little input from the \ngardener, although, if it is to be a strong feature of the mortal garden, it must \nbe regularly pulled up into fresh air. \nAny soil works for a Lily of the Damned, though some contend a rough and \ndamp texture causes them to blossom faster. The important aspect to bear in \nmind is to never allow the lily to forget its physical existence. Temperatures \ncan be hot or cold as long as it is uncomfortable, and light levels need only be \nhigh if the preoccupation with its body's presence has a visual component.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 3, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 4323}}
