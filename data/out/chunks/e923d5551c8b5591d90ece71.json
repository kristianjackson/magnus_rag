He wanted to pull the ripcord, to unfurl his \nparachute, but his hand wouldn't close over the grip. So he just fell. \nRobert was shaking badly at this point, so I got him a blanket and made him \nanother cup of tea. I wasn't sure I believed all what he was saying, but he'd \ncertainly been through something dreadful; I could see that. I asked him how \nlong he'd been falling like that, and he said he didn't know. His watch had \nstopped, but it had felt like hours. Days even. He had been so hungry, he said, \nbut had just kept falling. He didn't know which direction; there was just that \nempty sky all around, so it was impossible to tell. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG021 – Freefall \n6 \n \nFinally, he said, he saw the ground again. It didn't feel like a change or a \nsudden difference, he just closed his eyes as he had so often in that place, and \nwhen he opened them it was there, green and sprawling and rushing up \ntowards him. He'd been so relieved he'd almost forgotten to deploy his \nparachute. He did, though, and landed safely near the target area. \nHe was greeted by Harriet, who was surprised by how long it had taken him to \nget down. She told him it was almost fifteen minutes after when he should \nhave hit the ground, and Simon, this old man, and his supporters had already \nleft. It was obvious something was wrong, and Harriet asked Robert if he was \nalright. He repeated, “fifteen minutes, just fifteen”, and she told him “yes, \nwhat had been the problem?” Robert quit right there and then, and it was \nshortly after that he came to see me. \nNow obviously I was a bit speechless at my son's tale. It's hard to say how \nmuch of it I thought to be true. I didn't think he would ever have lied to me \nabout something like this, but at the same time the sort of thing he described, \nwell, I didn't think it sounded like something from a healthy mind. Let's just say \nI was thinking the sort of thing… you'll be thinking in a few minutes. Point is, I \ntried to talk him through his problems and his feelings, but the more he talked \nabout it, the more agitated he became, until at last I decided that we weren't \ngetting anywhere, and I got his old room ready for him. He slept soundly that \nnight, as far as I remember. \nThe next morning was a beautiful day. The sun was streaming through the \nwindow and the air was warm and still, without it being as hot as it had been \nthe week before. When Robert finally woke up, I suggested that we go for a \nshort walk to enjoy the day, and hopefully clear out any of that fear he felt that \nwas still hovering about. He didn't seem to want to go, at first, he kept glancing \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG021 – Freefall \n7 \n \nat the cloudless sky, but I promised him a picnic lunch and that seemed to \nconvince him. \nThat last hour was one of the happiest I'd ever spent with my son. In the \nsunlight, the bags under his eyes seemed to disappear, and after a few minutes \nhe even stopped glancing at the sky all the time. We walked along, sometimes \ntalking, sometime silent, and the world seemed to be alright. \nThere's a hill near where I live. It's a gentle, grassy slope but goes up quite \nhigh. You can see it from the kitchen window of my house. That's one of the \nreasons I'm moving. It was that hill we were climbing when it happened. We \nhad just reached the top, when Robert turned and to me with a sudden look of \nutter terror on his face. I asked him what was wrong; he just screamed and \npushed me away. I fell hard onto the ground, and could do nothing but watch \nas my son ran off up the hill. \nAnd then... And then… This is the part I can't put into words. I'm going to try, \nbut whatever you think of when you read this is not going to be what \nhappened; it will just be the closest I can describe before thinking about it too \nmuch gives me a migraine. The closest I can say is this: the sky ate him. \nHe didn't fall, or fly, or take-off. There wasn't anything in the sky that took him. \nIt wasn't a hand that reached out and grabbed him, it was the sky itself, the \nwhole sky, as far as the horizon I could see, that twisted around and moved \nlike... like the shifting of sand. It ate Robert. That's the only way I can describe \nit. Please don't make me do so again. \nJONATHAN SIMS \nStatement ends.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 3, "chunk_count": 5, "chars": 4328}}
