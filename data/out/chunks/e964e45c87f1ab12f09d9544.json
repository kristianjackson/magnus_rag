Either way, I dragged \nmyself up and, as I sat there, it all came back to me, what I’d seen, and I \nshuddered. \nI tried to tell myself I’d imagined it. Maybe I’d overreacted to finding a \nhomeless woman sleeping in the basement. Maybe she was sick and needed \nan ambulance. Oh god, maybe I’d left her to die. There was more knocking and \nI reached up to flick the light on. But when I did so nothing happened. I tried \nthe lamp next to my bed, but again, nothing. Looking around I saw that none of \nmy electronics seemed to be on. There must have been some sort of power \ncut. Again, someone knocked at the door. Maybe it was one of my \nneighbours… coming to check whether I’d lost power? So I shuffle over \ntowards the door and… reached for the handle. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG022 – Colony \n9 \n \nAs I was about to open it I got a sudden chill and stopped. What if she was \noutside, waiting? I mean th-the worms that made a hive of her body, eager, \nstriving to make me one as well. I thought of that awful case you had us \nlooking into where that woman… burst into worms, and I realised that this \nwoman must be that Jane Prentiss you were telling us about. I never had one \nof those peepholes added, so I couldn’t see what was out there, but as I took a \nstep back I saw something on the floor, crawling out from underneath the \ndoor. It was a small, silver-looking worm. I think I might have… lost my mind a \nbit, then. It all… feels very… strange, blurry. I-I remember stamping and \nstamping as-as more made their way under my doorway. I-I remember \ngrabbing every towel, sock, bit of fabric scrap that I could find, stuffing them \nunder the door, into the cracks around the window. Anything where a slender \nworm might crawl I made airtight. And then I sat there and waited. I-I still had \nno power, no phone, no way to communicate with the outside. \nThis went on for thirteen days. Every time I thought it might be safe to try and \nleave I’d hear that knocking at my door come back. Luckily there was no \nproblem with my water supply, so I had plenty to drink. I’m just glad none of \nthem thought to come up through the pipes. I eat a lot of… ready meals, cans, \nthat kind of thing, so… I had food, although after the first few days I had to \nstart rationing. \nIf I ever see another can of peaches… But… I-I think the worst part was the \nboredom. No internet, no phone, no power. I read the handful of print books I \nown several times. I-I didn’t really sleep. Every time I closed my eyes I’d start to \nfeel something was crawling… up my legs and I’d have to sit up and check. \nOther times I’d be awoken by that knocking. I spent a lot of time trying to \nremember what you told me about Jane Prentiss when we were working on \nTim Hodges statement, but… all I remembered were that she called herself to \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG022 – Colony \n10 \n \nbe a practising witch and was believed to be infected by a-a dangerous, \nunknown parasite. She never talked to me. I-I could have heard her clearly \nthrough the door, but she never made a sound apart from that knocking. From \nwhat I saw, maybe what was in her throat didn’t leave room for a voice. \nStrangely, she never tried to break down my door, either. Just knocked. She \nknocked… and knocked… and knocked. \nFinally, I woke up this morning and she was gone. I don’t know exactly how I \nknew. I-I think she brought that musty smell with her, and this morning I-I \ncouldn’t smell it. And there was no knocking. I mean, it still took me about four \nhours of checking and double-checking and listening at the letterbox before I \ngot the nerve to actually open the door, but when I did… there was no-one \nthere. And I ran… all the way here. \nJONATHAN SIMS \nStatement ends. \nYou’re sure about all of this, Martin? \n \nMARTIN \nLook, I'm not going to lie to you about something like this, John. I… like my job. \nMost of the time. \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nVery well. In which case there's a room in the archives I use to sleep when \nworking late. I suggest you stay there for now. I'll talk to Elias about whether \nwe can get extra security, but the Archives have enough locks for now. It's also \nsupposed to be humidity controlled and, though it hasn't been working for \nsome time, it does mean it's well-sealed. Nothing will be sneaking through any \nwindow cracks.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 5, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 4365}}
