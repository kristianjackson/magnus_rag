You can take a few days off to \nrecover if you need. \n \nSASHA \nNo, it’s fine. Tim’s getting me a coffee, and I’d rather get this down while it’s \nstill fresh in my mind. Besides, you didn’t give Martin any time off when he had \na bad experience. \n \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG026 – A Distortion \n2 \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nMartin had to start living in the archives. I mean, I could hardly give him a \nholiday in the office. Anyway, he wasn’t injured. \n \nSASHA \nIt’s just a scratch, John. I’ll be fine. Can we begin? \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nOkay. Statement of Sasha James, assistant archivist at the Magnus Institute, \nLondon, regarding… SASHA Let’s just call it ‘a series of paranormal sightings’. \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nStatement recorded direct from subject, 2nd of April 2016. \n \nSASHA \nRight. Well, I’m sure you know I was sceptical about how dangerous this Jane \nPrentiss was when you first suggested Martin stay in the archive. I mean, it’s \nnot that I didn’t believe him about what happened, it just seemed… Well, \nMartin is a great researcher, but his self-preservation instincts are not the \nstrongest, and to be frank I thought that if this Prentiss were a danger \neveryone seemed to think, then he’d almost certainly be dead. Don’t get me \nwrong, I mean, I’ve read the same statements and profiles as you, so I know \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG026 – A Distortion \n3 \n \nhow many people have died because of her. What was it, six hospital staff \nwhen she was first admitted? \n \nJONATHAN SIMS \nSix from colonisation and a seventh… with a broken neck from her escape. \n \nSASHA \nBut that was two years ago, and whatever she is now, it sounds like her \ncondition is degenerating. I just wasn’t sure how much damage she’d still be \ncapable of. So I guess… I didn’t take as much care as I should have when I was \ncoming into the Institute yesterday. The thing is, I’m still not sure how much of \na threat she is. I’ve seen plenty of those silver worm things squirming about \noutside, same as you, and made a point to step on them every time. What \nhappened just made things more… complicated, I guess. I’m not really sure \nwhat to think. \nI’ll start with the first thing I noticed. I live up near Finsbury Park, and my \nbuilding is old. Victorian, I think, and though it’s been repaired and maintained \nquite well, it’s got all sorts of strange little quirks. One of these is the windows. \nThe actual windows in the flats are fine, but the stairwells they have slightly \nwarped glass, where the window have those little bubbles. Looking down on \nthe street below can be a bit strange, as the glass bends the light and distorts \nwhatever’s below it. I never really paid much attention to it until a few days \nago, but it’s not a new thing. \nIt was the day before yesterday when I first saw it. When I’m heading down the \nstairs in the morning, I sometime like to spend a few seconds looking out of", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 0, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 3402}}
