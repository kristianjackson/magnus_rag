Episode one hundred and one. \nFamily Business. \n[Tape clicks on.] \nARCHIVIST \nRight, so I just... read it? \nJULIA \nHe’s the last page. \nTREVOR \n(Snorts) Good luck. I guess. \nARCHIVIST \nAh, you’re not staying to… I dunno, keep an eye on me? \nJULIA \nIt’s not a... Trevor doesn’t like using the book. I don’t either. Makes me feel off. \nDead should stay dead. \nARCHIVIST \nS-So… I mean, why keep it around? \nTREVOR \n\n ‘Cause sometimes talking to the dead can stop you joining ‘em. Come on Julia. \nJULIA \nAh, just give us a knock when you’re done. \nARCHIVIST \nSure. \n[Footsteps] \nSure... \n[Door closes.] \nRight... (Sighs) Okay. \n(The Archivist takes a deep breath before reading from the book.) “His \nconsciousness faded in and out like the tide. He tried to refuse their drugs, \nthough for what purpose even he could not have said. Perhaps he was simply \ntrying to push away the smell of disinfectant and grief that rose from his \nhospital bed. She was there sometimes, the one he had followed around the \nworld. There was almost sadness in her eyes. He felt himself begin to slip, the \nicy certainty of what was happening seeping through his flesh, and as he fell \naway for the final time, he felt that all-consuming fear. And his only thought \nwas to cry out for his mother. \nBut with the last vestige of his stubborn will, he refused. She would not claim \nhis last moment. \nHe was silent. \n[There’s an ominous rumble.] \nAnd so Gerard Keay ended.” \nGerard? Gerard Keay? \nGERARD \nYou’re new. Did you kill them? \n\nARCHIVIST \nUh… who? \nGERARD \nThe Hunters. They had this book. Are they dead? \nARCHIVIST \nN-No. \nGERARD \nThen piss off. I told them I’m not talking. \nARCHIVIST \nSorry, what? \nGERARD \n(Tired) I’m not their bloody Monster Manual. I’m done. \nARCHIVIST \nI-I-I didn’t— I mean, that’s not what this is. \nGERARD \nNo? They didn’t hand me over for you to use, like I’m a bloody dictionary they \nkeep in a special box? \nARCHIVIST \nUh... Yeah. \nGERARD \nLike I said. (Pause) You got a cigarette? \nARCHIVIST \nUh, oh, yeah. Here. C-Can you smoke it? \nGERARD \n\nUgh. I guess not. Yeah… Nice lighter. You a spider freak, then? \nARCHIVIST \nWhat? Oh! Er, no. I-I never really, uh... I never really thought of it. I-I’m John. \nI’m with the Magnus Institute. I-I’m the Archivist. \nGERARD \nWhen did she die? \nARCHIVIST \nAbout a year after you did. \nGERARD \nWas it peaceful? \nARCHIVIST \nNo. \nGERARD \nGood. Don’t think she would have wanted that. God, I can’t imagine her dying \nin bed. So you’re the new guy, then? Following in her footsteps? \nARCHIVIST \nI mean some of them. They… don’t exactly lead where I thought they would. \nGERARD \nYeah, she was like that. \nARCHIVIST \nI-I’m trying to stop the Unknowing. \nGERARD \n(Exhales) She didn’t manage it, then? \nARCHIVIST \n\nNot before she, uh... I need your help. \nGERARD \n(Snorts) Do you now? \nARCHIVIST \nShe thought she’d found a-a way to stop it. I think. If anyone knows what that \nwas, it’s you. \nGERARD \nNo. \nARCHIVIST \nWhat? W-Why not? If, if it happens, if the Circus— \nGERARD \nYeah, the world changes in horrible ways. For you. I’m a book. \nARCHIVIST \nYou can’t be serious. \nGERARD \nI’m dead serious. \n(Laughs) It hurts. Being like this. And it’s not like any pain you can feel when \nyou’re alive. It’s... it hurts to exist. To be dead and still here. And those two \nwant to keep me like this, so I can answer questions about their Dracula of the \nweek. So, no. Help me, or you go to your little apocalypse with nothing. \nARCHIVIST \nFine. What do you want? \nGERARD \nI want to go away. I want you to take my page and burn it. \nARCHIVIST \n\nI-I-I can’t do th— They’d know! They’d kill me. \nGERARD \nTear it out and take it, then. Do it somewhere else. \nARCHIVIST \nB-B-But if they check the book— \nGERARD \nGuess you better hope they don’t. \nARCHIVIST \nGerard, please... \nGERARD \nYou want answers, you tear out my page now! So I know you can’t back out. \nARCHIVIST \n(Sigh) Okay. \nGERARD \nOkay. \nARCHIVIST \n(Exhales) Ready? \n(Gerard inhales.) \n[The sound of tearing fibres as the page is ripped out.] \nThere. \nGERARD \nThank you. \nARCHIVIST", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 0, "chunk_count": 9, "chars": 4271}}
