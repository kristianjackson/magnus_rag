Tape clicks on.] \n(The Archivist sighs heavily.) \nARCHIVIST \nFuck. \n[Tape clicks off. Tape clicks off. Typing sounds: the sounds of Martin \nworking.] \nMARTIN \n(Still typing) Oh. Hi. Hello again. \n[He keeps typing.] \nMARTIN (CONT’D) \n(Small laugh) Sorry pal, false alarm this time. \n[He stops typing.] \nMARTIN (CONT’D) \n(Sigh, voice darkens dramatically) Unless… Peter. \n[The clock ticks in the background.] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 154 – Bloody Mary \nMARTIN (CONT’D) \nLook, Peter, I- \n[The door is thrown open. The Archivist bursts in.] \nARCHIVIST \nMartin! \nMARTIN \n(Overlapping) Oh- (quieter) John! God, don’t do that! \nARCHIVIST \nSorry, I just- \nMARTIN \nNo, it’s fine! I j- you just surprised me, that’s- (surprised) Jesus, you alright? \nYou- You look like hell. \nARCHIVIST \nOh! Uh, Ri, Right, I um, God, I get weak. Hungry, I guess, sort of. I,I’ve been \ntrying to avoid, being, um- sticking to old statements? Thank you for your little \nintervention, by the way. \nMARTIN \nLook, I wouldn’t have to if you’d hadn’t been- \nARCHIVIST \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 154 – Bloody Mary \n(Overlapping) Yes no, I know, I know; I’m sorry; that didn’t come out right; \nhonestly, thank you. It’s been hell, but- I, I did need to hear it. \nMARTIN \n(Pleasantly surprised) Oh, um. Uh,h, good. Are the others- helping? \nARCHIVIST \nOh. They’ve been keeping a, um, very close eye on me. (Half laugh) Well, that’s \nnot important- no, well, it is important, but it’s, it’s not why I’m here, I- \nMARTIN \nJohn. Calm down. What do you want? \nARCHIVIST \nI know. I know what you said, but I just- (inhale) I think I’ve found a way for us \nto leave the Institute. \n(Pause) \nMARTIN \nOkay? \nARCHIVIST \nYeah. But it’s- (heavy inhale) It’s pretty drastic. \nMARTIN \nWhat, you going to gouge your eyes out, or something? \n(Beat.) \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 154 – Bloody Mary \nMARTIN (CONT’D) \nFuck off. \nRight. Uh, uh, right, uh... (groping for words) Erm... like, I mean... \npermanently? Or… \nARCHIVIST \nI, I, I don’t know; I suppose. I, If your vision comes back, the Beholding \nprobably does as well- probably. But i-it’s not like it’s easy to only blind \nyourself temporarily anyways i- I- \nMARTIN \n(Weak) Uh, y,yeah, yeah, uh... H-Have you told the others, or?.. \nARCHIVIST \nNo, you’re the first. \nMARTIN \nWhy? \nARCHIVIST \nUh, because... because, because I trust you. I, I’m trying to think about what to \ndo, and I… (exhale) If I did try this, I don’t want to do it alone. But we could \nleave here, you and me. Escape. \nMARTIN \n(Weary) John. Don’t do this. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 154 – Bloody Mary \nARCHIVIST \nDo what? \nMARTIN \nMake it my decision. \nARCHIVIST \nI’m not- \nMARTIN \nI mean, (mirthless laugh) Could you even survive at this stage? Is there \nanything else keeping you alive? \nARCHIVIST \nUh, I,I don’t know. I don’t- know. But... maybe it’s worth it? The risk- y,you and \nme, together, getting out of here- \n(Martin sniffs.) \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \n-one way or another. \nMARTIN \nJohn. \n(Martin sighs.) \nARCHIVIST \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 154 – Bloody Mary \n(Sharp exhale) No. No, o,of course, this was stupid; you have your own plans \ngoing on, don’t you? \nMARTIN \nJust- Look, I need to see this thing through with Peter to the end. If, If what \nhe’s saying is even half true, I need to be there. \nARCHIVIST \nBut what if you don’t? (Small exhale) We could just leave. I mean, whatever \ntheir plan is for me, I am damn sure that doing that isn’t it. I’d derail \neverything- we could derail everything, and then just- leave! \n(Martin laughs, humourlessly) \nARCHIVIST \nWhat? \n(Martin keeps laughing.) \nMARTIN \nNothing; It’s just- (one more laugh) It’s just ironic, that’s all. \nARCHIVIST \nMartin… \nMARTIN \nWho are you kidding, Jon? You’re not going to do any of that. \nARCHIVIST", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 5, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 4042}}
