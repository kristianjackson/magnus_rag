Him and Peter Lukas are looking \nfor something d-down in the tunnels. \nBASIRA \nDo you know what? \nARCHIVIST \nNo, he called it a device. \nDAISY \nWhen? \nARCHIVIST \nI-I mean, I don't— I mean... n-now? I guess? They could— it can't be a \ncoincidence that this is when Elias chooses to make a break for it. \nBASIRA \nYou think he's coming here? \nARCHIVIST \nYou don't? \nDAISY \nLet's go. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 158 – Panopticon \n \n8 \nARCHIVIST \n(Sighs) I'll get the key. \n[Tape clicks off] \n[Tape clicks on] \n[Faint sound of the Lonely static] \n[Martin and Peter’s footsteps clang as they walk in a large \nechoing space] \nMARTIN \nWhat is this place? \nPETER \nThe panopticon of Millbank prison. Not quite as Smirke originally conceived it, \nof course; Jonah Magnus made certain... adjustments. \nMARTIN \nAnd it's been down here the whole time? \nPETER \nWhy'd you think this was chosen as the Institute's location when the prison \nclosed? It's a significant site of power for the Beholding. From the tower in the \ncentre of this room, you can see everything. \nMARTIN \nBut there's nothing in the cells. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 158 – Panopticon \n \n9 \nPETER \nI don't mean the cells, Martin! I mean everything. Come on. Mind your step, \nthis comes from an era before safety rails. \nMARTIN \nB… But I don't understand. Why are we here? \nPETER \nIt's quite simple, really. I want to use the powers of this place to learn about \nthe Extinction— what it's doing, where it's manifesting. Then we can stop it. \nMARTIN \nAnd you need me for this? \nPETER \nCorrect! Without a connection to The Eye, any attempt to use it would likely \nend very messily indeed. But thankfully it just so happens that you hold such a \nconnection. \nMARTIN \nSo that's it. Both Lonely and Watching. \nPETER \nYou must admit you're the perfect candidate. \nMARTIN \nI suppose I am. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 158 – Panopticon \n \n10 \nPETER \nThere is, of course, just one other complication? \nYou'll have to dispose of the current occupant. \nMARTIN \nCurrent... \n[Martin sees; and they stop walking] \n(Tense) Who is that? \nPETER \nJonah Magnus! His body at least. Sitting here, watching. Binding it all together, \ngrowing ever older. If you want to take his place, well... \nMARTIN \nI'll need to kill him. \nPETER \nYes. Don't worry, though, I brought a knife. \n[The sound of a rolling, metal gate being opened and sliding back] \n[Martin steps forward] \n(Martin takes a trembling breath) \nMARTIN \nWhere are his eyes? \n[A footstep] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 158 – Panopticon \n \n11 \nELIAS \nExactly where they've always been, Martin. \n(Martin gasps) \nWatching over my Institute. \n[Tape clicks off] \n[Tape clicks on] \n[A quiet room] \nBASIRA \nAnd you're sure? \nARCHIVIST \nYes, I'm sure it wasn't here before! \nBASIRA \nIt's just that there's a lot of tapes around. \nARCHIVIST \nAnd I don't keep any of them with the key to the tunnels. It's been left for me. \nDAISY \nAnd it says 'play me'. Kind of suspicious. \nBASIRA \nSo Elias left it. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 158 – Panopticon \n \n12 \nARCHIVIST \nOr Martin. Or Peter, or Annabelle! \nBASIRA \nFine. Whatever. Could be a distraction. \nARCHIVIST \nOnly one way to find out. \nBASIRA \nWe don't have time for this. \nDAISY \nWe don't know that. We've no idea what sort of time frame we're on. I say \nplay it. \nARCHIVIST \nThank you. \n[Tape clicks off] \n[Tape clicks on] \n[The sound of liquid being sloshed around; the Archivist’s office \ndoor swings open] \nELIAS \n(Further back) Gertrude.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 1, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 3792}}
