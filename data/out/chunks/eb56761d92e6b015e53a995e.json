I assume that’s why I had the police asking after you? \nARCHIVIST \nOh, they came here? \nGEORGIE \nIt’s fine, you were asleep. Anyway, that – \nARCHIVIST \nWh– \nGEORGIE \n– that makes sense, but it doesn’t explain the hand. \nARCHIVIST \nOh, that was… that was one of the other… ‘avatars’. \nGEORGIE \nOf your guy, or…? \nARCHIVIST \nNo, no. My… my patron is focused on knowledge and observation. Elias calls it \nThe Eye, but I’ve also heard it called Beholding, or Ceaseless Watcher… a lot of \nnames. This one was… The Lightless Flame, or, or I think she called it The \nDesolation. It’s burning, destruction, pain. All the bad bits of fire without any of \nthe light or joy. \nGEORGIE \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG093 – Contaminant \n18 \n \nSounds lovely. And you were meeting them because…? \nARCHIVIST \nOne of the powers, The Stranger, is… Its beings are trying to perform a ritual \nthey call The Unknowing. Apparently it’s meant to remake the world, bring it \ncloser to their master. I don’t know exactly what that means, or where it is, \nbut… I need to stop it. \nGEORGIE \nJonathan Sims, are you trying to save the world? \nARCHIVIST \nI… Yeah. I… I guess I am. \nBut, but I need information, so I’ve been trying to find as many like me as \npossible. I’ve got a lot of leads: a weird Russian circus run by Gregor, or, or \nNikola, Orsinov, and these weird van drivers that seem to turn up everywhere, \nand mannequins and taxidermy and skin, and all sorts, but… nothing solid. \nElias has been sending me statements, apparently to prepare me, whatever \nthat means, but some of the people I’ve been talking to have been… very \ndangerous. I’m starting to feel like a bit of a punching bag, to be honest. Would \nbe nice to meet a monster, and not have a scar to show for it. \nGEORGIE \nWell. Shit. \nARCHIVIST \nSo… You believe me? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG093 – Contaminant \n19 \n \nGEORGIE \nYeah. Yeah, I do. \nARCHIVIST \nOh, thank god. \nGEORGIE \nJohn. These, these things you’re talking about? Is… Is one of them, like, Death? \nARCHIVIST \nUh, yes. I-I-I think so. There’s one I’ve heard called “The End”. Why? \nGEORGIE \nI’ll make us a cup of tea. \n[Tape clicks off.] \n[The Magnus Archives Theme - Outro] \nThe Magnus Archives is a podcast distributed by Rusty Quill and licensed under \na creative commons attribution, non-commercial share alike 4.0 international \nlicense.
