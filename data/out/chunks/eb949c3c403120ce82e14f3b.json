It had a ‘Closed’ sign displayed \nprominently, despite the time of morning, and there were no interior lights on. \nI couldn’t see anything inside except the old, poorly refrigerated meat hanging \nin the window, dripping silently onto the trays below. I reminded myself how \nmuch money was on the line and tried the handle. To my surprise, it was \nunlocked. I slipped inside the shadowed storefront before anyone spotted me. \nThe smell was rancid, but not as strong as I had expected. A quick glance \naround the place told me why – aside from the window display, the room was \ndevoid of meat. In fact, there didn’t seem to be much there at all, aside from a \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG049 – The Butcher’s Window \n8 \n \nrefrigerated counter and drinks cooler. Both sat empty. I waited and listened, \nprepared to bolt through the door at the slightest sound, but it was quiet. \nI gathered myself and made my way around the counter to open the door into \nthe back. I was keeping on an eye out for anything that might have given a hint \nas to Hector’s fate. As soon as I had proof, I was gone.

There were several large lockers along one wall, a \nsteel chair in the corner and, though there were no stainless steel drawers, the \ntarpaulin covered shape that lay awkwardly on the large central table was \ndisconcertingly familiar. I took a breath and pulled back the plastic sheet. \nHector Laredo lay there on the table. He was naked, utterly still and, though he \nseemed to be in one piece, his skin had the sickly pallor of a corpse. I sighed, \nrelieved at this discovery, which, from my perspective, was about the best \nresult I could have hoped for. I spent a minute or two taking pictures for Nicola \nand headed back towards the door. And that’s when everything started to go \nhorribly wrong. \nWhen I reached the doorway back into the shopfront, I took a second to glance \nthrough the window and I froze. In the entrance to the shop stood a huge, \nhulking silhouette. It reached to push it open and I staggered back into the \nroom, looking for another way out.
