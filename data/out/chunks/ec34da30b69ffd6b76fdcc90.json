Maybe not if you’re used to it, I suppose. If you’ve \nlived a solitary life then I’m sure it doesn’t feel so isolated or empty. Heck, I \nremember a time when I wouldn’t have batted an eyelid at living on my own. \nBut now I’m so used to having other people in the house that it’s a sad, lonely \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG027 – A Sturdy Lock \n2 \n \nexistence I’ve found myself living. Even before I started having my nightly \nvisitor. \nMy son Marcus moved out about two years ago, and before that he’d spent a \nlot of time away at university or, later, moving around because of his work. So \nI’d grown accustomed to his absence. But when Diane, my wife, passed away \nfour months ago it has… left the place so terribly hollow. I tell myself that it \nwas a mercy, that by the end her condition meant she wasn’t able to live as \nshe deserved to. And while I’m sure it’s true, the sentiment does little to make \nthe bed seem anything other than far too large for just me. She’d hate me \nsaying that. Diane never had any time for mopers or people who wallowed in \nself-pity, but after forty years of marriage I think I’ve earned it. \nThe thing about living in a house full of people if that you can just ignore any \nnoises that you hear in the night. Is that a creak on the stairs? It’s probably just \nsomeone going down for a glass of water. What was that thump? Probably \nMarcus up too late, and accidentally knocking things off the table. I know it \ndoesn’t actually make you less likely to be robbed or broken into, but you stop \npanicking about it every time you hear the slightest noise from outside your \nroom. I think that’s normal, at least. I’ve never considered myself to have a \nnervous disposition, but maybe other people just get on with things and don’t \nworry so much. \nStill, since Diane died my nights have become a constant vigil. No house is \nsilent if you listen hard enough, and since ending up alone, I have been \nlistening so hard that at points I have to remind myself to breathe. Now every \nsoft groan of the settling house is the sound of some violent thug or burglar in \nmy home, waiting to see if they need to kill me.
