It talked of Garland Hillier’s “new \nrevelation” about the “absolute change of the world” in terms that seemed at \nfirst elegiac, but later seemed almost panicked, with the final entry simply \nrepeating the words “la porte est la porte”, “the door is the door”. Clearly his \nmental state had been in decline, and Bernadette said she could not help \ndwelling on the image of this poor man, his whole world shifting and falling \naway from him, lost and alone in his tiny apartment, gradually losing himself, \nuntil at last, he lay down and simply did not get up again. But that couldn’t be \nthe case, she knew, as there had been no sign of a body. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 134 – Time of Revelation \n \n5 \n \nBernadette arrived and got into the building without any trouble save for the \nfive flights of stairs that needed to be climbed, and found the door unlocked. \nMonsieur Pinard, who had been supposed to meet her there, was apparently \nnowhere to be found, so she simply let herself in. \nThe place felt strange, she told me, like a tiny pocket of another time, a bubble \nwhere the world had never changed, and stepping inside she almost felt like \nshe would never change either. Even the light that came through the window \nseemed to be of a different quality, muted and gentle. The street chatter of \nParis, which usually reaches all but the most remote of windows, seemed to \nvanish entirely. There was a sense of peace to it all, shot through with a strand \nof disquiet, a wrongness she told me she could not identify, but she could \nalmost smell it. \nThe objects left within the room itself were, unfortunately, somewhat \ndisappointing. While the clothes and household objects were in a remarkable \nstate of preservation, none gave any particular insight into the life or fate of \nGarland Hillier. The bed was unmade, but seemed to hold no clues, and aside \nfrom the journal, there were no papers in the place that gave any useful \ninformation, save for a few letters from Hachette and the like, declining to \nprint his essays. \nAll in all, Bernadette described it as intensely disappointing, at least from her \nperspective, since the only aspect that served to shine any further light on \nHillier, his theology or his fate, seemed to be the journal, something she hadn’t \nneeded to spend an hour and a half on the train to get to. She turned to leave, \nand that, she says, is when she started to get the sense that something was \nwrong. The door had been damaged by the builders who uncovered the place \nand there were several distinct gaps in the wood, but as she walked back out, \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 134 – Time of Revelation \n \n6 \n \nthe door appeared to be whole. She ignored it, and left anyway, trying to \nreason it all away as a strange quirk of memory, just one of those things. \nUnfortunately for her, it was not the only thing that had changed. \nThe walls of the stairwell were discoloured, as though covered with some a \ndusting of some faint yellowish dirt, and the stone steps were ever so slightly \nsticky beneath her shoes. There was no sound, no sign of life other than the \nsqueaking of leather as she descended, trying desperately to convince herself \nthat nothing was wrong, that it had been just as quiet on the way up, that this \nbuilding had always had a thick, humid feeling to the air. \nWhen she stepped outside into the street of corpses, that was when her mind \ncould no longer deny that she was not in any Paris that she knew, no matter \nwhat the architecture might have looked like. There were hundreds of them, \nstood in place where they had died, some fallen, a few kneeling. They were \nstiff and desiccated, mummified by some process Bernadette could not begin \nto guess at, but that rendered their flesh like tightly packed ash. At least, that’s \nwhat it looked like, as she dared not touch them. Those that had fallen seemed \nto have fused with the street, and some that seemed to have been too close to \nnearby walls were embedded within them. Every single shrivelled, ashen face \nwas contorted in a scream of agony; every sharp and jutting jaw cracked and \ntwisted in an expression of horror, of understanding not just of their death, but \nthe end of everything they knew. It was clear that they had been this way for \nyears, if not decades. Bernadette says she was sure that nothing had moved in \nthat dead city for a hundred years. She was mistaken. \nI have never envied you your position, Gertrude. I", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 3, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 4499}}
