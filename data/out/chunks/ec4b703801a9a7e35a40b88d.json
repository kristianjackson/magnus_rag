This particular encounter doesn’t seem to \nhave much in common with manifestations from similar buildings. We’ve had \nsomething of a spectrum from him and his ilk. Cobwebs, entombing, difficulty \nin navigation, and now a violent, murderous dark. \nMy first thought was the People’s Church of the Divine Host, as they seem to \nhave some affinity to the darkness, but I can find no connection of any sort \nbetween them and West Hackney church. Not that any of the staff there were \nvery helpful. Every one of them claims to have no memory of encountering Ms \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 063 – The End of the Tunnel \n \n12 \n \nGallagher-Nelson, despite hospital admission records clearly stating she was \npicked up from there on the morning of the 26th March 2014. Tim is convinced \nthat at least some of them are lying, but there’s little we can do to gain any \ninformation they don’t wish to volunteer. \nWe’ve been unable to follow up with Ms Gallagher-Nelson. All attempts to \ncontact her have been prevented by her wife Stephanie Gallagher-Nelson, who \nhas made it abundantly clear that we are not welcome and are to attempt no \nfurther contact.

None of the obvious passwords I’ve tried have been successful and I am \nunsure who can provide both assistance and discretion. There may be further \nclues on the other tapes, but so far, I’ve had no word from Basira. I’m so close \nto finding something, maybe I should just go down— \n[The door opens.] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 063 – The End of the Tunnel \n \n13 \n \nMELANIE \nExcuse me, do you have a moment? \nARCHIVIST \nMs King? How did you, er… how did you get in here? \nMELANIE \nThe new girl let me in. Are you all right? \n[The Archivist shuts the laptop.] \nARCHIVIST \n(Distracted) Hmm, Sorry? \nMELANIE \nYou look like hell. \nARCHIVIST \nIt’s been a hard few months. Look, can I help you? Because if you’re just after \nanother shouting match... \nMELANIE \nNo, I, um... I actually do need your help. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 063 – The End of the Tunnel \n \n14 \n \nARCHIVIST \nMm. Interesting. \nMELANIE \nAll right, can you not be an arsehole about it? I just need access to your library. \nARCHIVIST \nSo, talk to Diana. She runs the place. \nMELANIE \nYes, I don’t exactly have the academic credentials you guys demand. So I \napparently need someone to vouch for me, and you’re basically the closest \nthing I have to a friend here. \nARCHIVIST \nWe’ve spoken once and we ended up screaming at each other. \nMELANIE \nYes, and that’s more than I have with anyone else here. Also, uh, Georgie \nactually has some nice things to say about you. \nARCHIVIST \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 063 – The End of the Tunnel \n \n15 \n \nOh. \nMELANIE \nThat came as a surprise. You didn’t even tell me you knew her. \nARCHIVIST \nI... it was a long time ago. Before she started doing What the Ghost? \nMELANIE \nHuh. \nARCHIVIST \nIt’s a surprise to me as well, to be honest. We didn’t exactly part on the best of \nterms. \nMELANIE \nMm. \nARCHIVIST \nWhat exactly do you need from us anyway? Can’t your showbiz friends help \nyou? \nMELANIE \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 063 – The End of the Tunnel \n \n16 \n \nNo, I’m... most of... most of them won’t talk to me anymore. \nARCHIVIST \nWhat happened? Did word get out that you’d given a statement to us? What \nwas it, “credulous idiots”? \nMELANIE \nNot exactly... look, in my business your reputation is all that you have. \nARCHIVIST \nHm. \nMELANIE \nThe industry’s mainly full of sceptics pretending to be believers pretending to \nbe sceptics. \nARCHIVIST \nI think the word you’re looking for is charlatans.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 5, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 3903}}
