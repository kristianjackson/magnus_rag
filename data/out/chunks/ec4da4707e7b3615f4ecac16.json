Episode one hundred and eighty-\ntwo: \"Wellbeing.\" \n[Theme finishes] \n[Tape clicks on] \n[Wasteland winds with distant distorted howls; closer there are \nmuffled tannoy announcements punctuated with high-pitched \nfeedback squeals] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 182 – Wellbeing \n2 \nMARTIN \nSeriously? \nARCHIVIST \nYup. \nMARTIN \nNot an hour from an oasis, and we’re already at sinister hospitals? \nARCHIVIST \nIt’s the next stop on our journey. \nMARTIN \nOf course it is. And, of course, there’s no chance for a warm-up? \nARCHIVIST \n(Incredulous) …A warm-up? \nMARTIN \nYeah, y’know. Something a bit more… manageable. A-A chance to get our \nbearings a bit first. \nARCHIVIST \nWhat exactly did you have in mind? \nMARTIN \nI dunno. Y’know like, like a creepy... bus stop or something? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 182 – Wellbeing \n3 \nARCHIVIST \n(Amused) I’m afraid not. \nTruth be told, I’m actually feeling pretty great. \n…Which isn’t necessarily a good thing, I suppose. \nMARTIN \nYeah, I know. \n(Sigh) \nWe stayed in Salesa’s as long as you could. \nARCHIVIST \nA bit longer, actually. I was, ah… not really holding it together by the end. \nMARTIN \nWhy didn’t you say something? \nARCHIVIST \nIt’s fine. I’m fine. \nMARTIN \nYeah now. \nARCHIVIST \nI just thought, what with Daisy and Basira, and... You needed a break. Some \ntime to process. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 182 – Wellbeing \n4 \nMARTIN \nWe both did. But apparently I’m the only one who got to. \nARCHIVIST \nIt’s okay. I deal with things differently these days. I just wanted to make sure \nthat you were doing okay. Was I wrong? To hold off? \n(Beat) \nMARTIN \nNo. No you weren’t. Just getting the chance to sleep again was... \n…Ah well. Good while it lasted. Come on then, ‘nightmare hospital’ it is. \nARCHIVIST \nWould it help if I told you we were actually starting to get a bit closer to \nLondon? Well, what was “London”. \nMARTIN \nActually yes. That does help a bit. How many more? \nARCHIVIST \nDepends on, uh… A few, at least. \nMARTIN \nRight. \n(Fortifying deep breath) Right, let’s get on with it then. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 182 – Wellbeing \n5 \n[They walk through sliding doors and into the hospital; the muffled \nsounds of screams, bandsaws and other ‘devices’ become audible; \na constant distant alarm sound plays] \n[They pause walking] \nMARTIN \nOkay… could be worse... \n[The sound of blades, like knives being sharpened or unoiled \nscissors working] \nDR DOE \nGood! \nMARTIN \n(Scared) HAHHH! HMMM! Worse! It got worse! Worse, ah, much worse… \nARCHIVIST \nMartin, be polite. \n(Martin sounds discomforted) \nHello! \n[Blade sounds accompany Dr Doe’s movements and gestures; her \nvoice sounds slightly distorted and her manner is upbeat] \nDR DOE \nPleasure yes hello! I am Doctor Doe, Jane. Welcome into my hospital Inspector. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 182 – Wellbeing \n6 \nARCHIVIST \nInspector? \nDR DOE \nYou have come here to over-observe yes? To inspector? \nARCHIVIST \nI, uh, I s-s-suppose so. Y-Yes. \nDR DOE \nThen follow. Let us tour our wellbeing centre. Keep your screams inside if you \nwant to be polite. \nARCHIVIST \nRight. \n[They begin walking; Dr Doe’s walk has a constant blade-\nsharpening sound] \n[Sounds of screams and devices evolve as they move] \nMARTIN \n(Nervously) It’s a... Beautiful building. \nDR DOE \nDo not insult me. \nMARTIN \nI, uh... okay. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 182 – Wellbeing \n7 \n(Beat) \nW-What’s it called? \nDR DOE \nCalled? \nMARTIN \nThe hospital. \nDR DOE \nAh. St Bleedings Centre for Wellbeing. \nMARTIN \n(Drawled) Right. \nARCHIVIST \n(Hushed) Martin, keep your eyes forward. On the doctor. \nMARTIN \n(Hushed) Seriously? She’s all kinds of horrible— \nARCHIVIST \nBetter than what’s in the rooms. Trust me. \nMARTIN \nAh, right. \n[They stop walking as Dr Doe opens a door]", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 0, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 4275}}
