You were starting another, and I didn't want to wait. We should get \ngoing. \nARCHIVIST \nYou-you were listening, I-I, I, I thought that— \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 172 – Strung Out \n16 \nMARTIN \nNo, I— Not for most of it. I just thought I heard… something. Whatever. I went \nexploring, alright? I don't know why; I shouldn't have. \nARCHIVIST \nNo, you-you shouldn't have! \nMARTIN \nYou know how many stages there are in this place, how many, little theatres? \nARCHIVIST \nYes. Yes I do. \nMARTIN \nRight, stupid question. \nARCHIVIST \nMartin… \nMARTIN \nWell, let's just say they have a full bill, alright? \n[In the background, an announcer makes a show-starting \nannouncement] \nARCHIVIST \nMartin. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 172 – Strung Out \n17 \nMARTIN \nWhat? \nARCHIVIST \nWhy did you go looking? \nMARTIN \nCan we just go, please? \nARCHIVIST \nOf course. But... you were safe here. And after everything that's already \nhappened, I, I-I just don't understand why you would… \nMARTIN \n(Sudden burst) Me neither, okay! \nARCHIVIST \nWhat? \nMARTIN \n(Emotional) I mean, that's it, isn't it? I don't know! I don't know why I went \nexploring. \nARCHIVIST \n(carefully) Are you saying you were... Compelled? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 172 – Strung Out \n18 \nMARTIN \nI'm saying I don't know, do I? I-I thought I was just curious; it felt like curiosity, \nbut, given where we are, and with the Web everywhere, and Annabelle Cane \nstill out there playing mind games with payphones, I just… \nI mean, how d'you even know if it's your motivation, you know? Being here… \n(sigh) it-it just makes me second-guess all of it, and I, I don't like it, it… really \nscares me. \nARCHIVIST \nI, uh… \nMARTIN \nOh, don't say that's what it wants; I know. \nARCHIVIST \nI, I wasn't going to. \n[In the background, there is another announcement] \nMARTIN \nOkay. Right. \nARCHIVIST \nI was going to suggest that I could... maybe... Know. I could look. Just a quick \npeek, to, to see if it was just curiosity or… something else. \nWell? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 172 – Strung Out \n19 \nMARTIN \nI don't— \nIf you look, and I was… influenced, then how can I trust anything else? How can \nI believe any of my thoughts and feelings are really mine? \nARCHIVIST \n(Struggling) Uh— Well, I, I'll still be here to check. I-I'm not leaving you. \nMARTIN \nSure, but you'd be looking through the details of everything that ever crosses \nmy mind? I don't want that, y-you know I don't want that. \n[In the background, there is another announcement] \nARCHIVIST \nI know. \nDon't do this to yourself, Martin. This is what it wants, the, the paranoia. \nTrust me, I, I know. \nMARTIN \nFair. \n(Beat) \n(Exhale) John, what does the Web want? It's… I mean, we know it's got a plan; \ncan't you just, see what it is? \n(The Archivist sighs) \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 172 – Strung Out \n20 \nARCHIVIST \nKnowing... seeing... i-it's not the same thing as... understanding. Every time I \ntry to Know what the Web's plan is, if it can even be called a plan, I see a \nhundred thousand events and causes and links, an impossibly intricate pattern \nof consequences and subtle nudges, but I, I can't, I can't hold them all in my \nhead at the same time. \nThere's no way to see the whole, the, the point of it all. I can see all the details, \nbut it doesn't provide context or… intention. \nI suppose the Web doesn't work in knowledge, not in the same way. \nMARTIN \nOh. Right. \nARCHIVIST \nSorry. \nMARTIN \nAnd Annabelle? \nARCHIVIST \nStill can't see her. If it wasn't for the phone call, I'd have said she was probably \nalready dead. \nMARTIN \n(Quiet) Yeah. \n(Beat)", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 5, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 3577}}
