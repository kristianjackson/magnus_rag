If there is official documentation of this \nparticular shipment that might verify Mr Yang’s story, we’re not able to obtain \nthem. \nMartin encountered a different problem tracking down Mr Yang himself. \nApparently, he’s retired now and living with his children, who were surprisingly \ncooperative in allowing Martin to see him. He’s also in the later stages of early \nonset Alzheimer’s disease. He could provide no new useful information and \nMartin left after Mr Yang became acutely distressed at the mention of boxes. \nAll in all, a dead end. If this was the first time Mikaele Salesa had turned up in \nour files, I would definitely agree with Mr Yang’s own assessment. But by now, \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 066 – Held in Customs \n \n10 \n \nthere are far too many cases to chalk them all up to drugs. Whatever Salesa \ndeals in is, I suspect, infinitely more dangerous. \nEnd recording. \n[Tape clicks off. Tape clicks on.] \nARCHIVIST \nSupplemental. Gertrude’s laptop has been rather... interesting. Unfortunately, \nnothing along the lines ‘My Murderer.avi’, and she didn’t keep any sort of diary \nfrom what I can see. In fact, it doesn’t look like she kept many documents at all \n– a few budget spreadsheets and work forms, but I get the feeling she wasn’t \nmuch of a notetaker. The thing that is interesting in the budget spreadsheet is \nthe rather large amount she requested for travel. What’s even stranger is that \nit seems the budget was approved. \nHer internet history and emails reveal some more pertinent information; it \nlooks like she did do a lot of travel, all over the world, far further than the \nsingle basement one would expect an archivist to keep to. And in these cases \nat least, she kept the receipts and the booking information: Nairobi, Wichita, \nBudapest, Shanghai... the list goes on. No records as far back as ‘98, of course, \nbut given the pattern, I don’t think a trip to Alexandria is at all out of the \nquestion. \nThere’s also the matter of the products she was ordering. There are several \nonline orders of petrol, lighter fluid, pesticides and high-powered torches. They \nare sporadic, but notable in that she did not drive, smoke or work in pest \ncontrol. The torches would make sense if it wasn’t for the quantities in which \nshe ordered them. She also sent orders for a staggering array of filing tabs, \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 066 – Held in Customs \n \n11 \n \nlabels and index markers. All different makes, formats and systems, most of \nwhich I have encountered in various forms around the archives. \nGiven that the doddering old lady image is now dispelled in its entirety, I \ncannot help but wonder if there is a reason she was keeping the files in \ndisarray. I’m not convinced she would approve of my efforts to organise them. \nPart of me is tempted to follow her lead and suspend my explorations, but the \nmore I find out about Gertrude, the less I am inclined to trust her, and I am not \nsure emulating her is the wisest course of action. \nEspecially given the three more alarming purchases I found in her history. \nGertrude Robinson was trying to buy Leitners. Seeing the account name \ngrbookworm1818 gave me a particularly hollow laugh. Obvious when you are \nlooking for it, I suppose. It looks like she managed to get hold of three books: a \nspecial printing of The Seven Lamps of Architecture by John Ruskin, that rather \ndubious copy of The Key of Solomon and a 1910 pamphlet simply entitled A \nDisappearance. I am quite sure none of them are in the archives and they \nweren’t in her flat either. I rather hope she destroyed them, especially as The \nKey of Solomon is something of an almanac on demonology, but my luck isn’t \nthat good. \nAll told, the laptop has given me much cause for concern and little in the way \nof hard evidence. The more I learn about Gertrude, the more I respect her, and \nthe more I worry about her motives. Perhaps I’ve been focusing on the wrong \nquestion and the most important thing isn’t who killed her, but why? \nEnd supplemental. \n[Tape clicks off.]", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 5, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 4052}}
