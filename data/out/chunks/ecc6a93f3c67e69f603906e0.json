Not really. You forget, \nwe’ve been watching you a long time, and I know you, Gertrude. You don’t \nactually care about the fears; you’re too practical. All your energy is focused \ndown here, on monsters and murderers and all the things doing the dirty work \nfor them beyond. You know plenty, sure, but you don’t have that obsession, \nthat stupid urge to try and understand and classify things that use logic and \nreality like weapons. \nGERTRUDE \nHm, perhaps. \nARTHUR \nAlways respected you for that. It takes a strong stomach to not give a shit. \nGERTRUDE \nYou’ll forgive me if I’m not overjoyed at the compliment. \n \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 145 – Infectious Doubts \n \n14 \n \nARTHUR \nSuit yourself. \nGERTRUDE \nSo, now Diego has taken over, where does that leave you? \nARTHUR \nHuh. Slum-lording over a nest. \nGERTRUDE \nA nest of what? \nARTHUR \nFound a mass of the crawling rot growing, a while back. Managed to get hold \nof the property before it became too big. Gotta wait ‘til it blossoms before we \ncan properly burn it, so until then, I’m just playing landlord. It’s alright, I guess. \nYou’d be surprised the misery and pain you can cause when you have control \nover someone’s home. If you’re careful, if you’re smart, you can burn their life \nto ashes as thoroughly as any fire, and worst comes to worst, you can still do it \nthe old-fashioned way. Had an elderly tenant last year. Oh, she was in a \nterrible state. I had her trapped, too poor and immobile to do anything but sit \nthere, then I broke her boiler so the cold started to get her. Not exactly my \nusual, but agony is agony. But then her son and his wife moved in with her to \nhelp her out. Not much I could do against that, so I just waited until all three \nwere home and set the place ablaze. They went up nicely, screaming all the \nway as the flames started to reach them. The doors were locked and the \nhandles too hot, so they didn’t have a hope of escape. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 145 – Infectious Doubts \n \n15 \n \nGERTRUDE \nYes, that’s quite enough, I think. \nARTHUR \nOh, I’m sorry. There I was, thinking you liked the gory details. My mistake. \nGERTRUDE \nI think we’re just about done here. \nARTHUR \nAll your burning questions answered? \nGERTRUDE \nI’m certainly convinced you don’t know anything else useful. \nARTHUR \nSo, I’m free to go? You’re not going to, y’know … \nGERTRUDE \n(Laughs) I suppose you’ll have to wait and see. \nARTHUR \nSuppose I will. \nGERTRUDE \nYou tell the others. Make sure they know what happened to Eugene. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 145 – Infectious Doubts \n \n16 \n \nARTHUR \nSure. Can’t make any promises, though, especially for Jude. She really hates \nyou. \nGERTRUDE \nTell her she’s welcome to try. Oh, and tell them I’m extending my protection to \nyoung Mr Barnabas. They hurt him anymore, then what happened to Eugene \nwill seem like a mercy. \nARTHUR \nYou’re really pushing it, you know that? \nGERTRUDE \nFeel free to push back. But until then, get out of my archives. \n[Tape clicks off. Tape clicks on.] \nARCHIVIST \nThe more I listen and learn, the more it seems to me we’re all just groping \nabout, trying desperately to find out what we’re actually meant to be doing. \nThese things that loom so large over our lives, trap us and push us and \nsometimes kill us, but never actually tell us what we’re supposed to be doing. \nSo, we scheme and we plot. We lash out at each other without ever really \nknowing why. I think Gertrude knew this, knew to focus her attention on those \nparts that could be understood and, well, and killed. But I’m really starting to \nworry there aren’t any answers, not like I want there to be. There aren’t any \nanswers at Ny-Ålesund. There aren’t answers in the past.
