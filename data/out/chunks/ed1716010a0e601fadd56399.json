And she can move a lot quicker \nthan we can. \nMARTIN \nUm, yeah, okay, but I'm still not hearing a plan as such. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 176 – Blood Ties \n9 \nARCHIVIST \nAh— \nMARTIN \nWhat? \nARCHIVIST \nUh— Hold on. \nMARTIN \nOh my god, are you actually serious, right now? \nARCHIVIST \nI'm sorry! \n(Martin makes a short annoyed sigh) \nMARTIN \nFine. Just — I'll keep a lookout, be quick. \nARCHIVIST \nI'll do my best. \n[Martin walks away] \n[Hissing static starts] \nARCHIVIST \nFeet pound silent whisper silent blood on lips blood on teeth blood scent of \nhated prey flows through veins and into feet pound silent in pursuit. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 176 – Blood Ties \n10 \n[Hissing static ends] \n[The birds of prey fall silent while the rest of the forest sounds \ncontinue; now with the jagged breaths and running feet of a group \nof people; and every so often a rustle as they go through the \nundergrowth] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nTeeth smile. Ready to kill. \nThe lashing branches reach and claw and try to hold back the charging \nvengeance of the pack. But they slip, and fall away. The killers make no sound \nas they move across the forest floor, their steps quick and certain. In the \ndistance they hear the crashing stumble of the one who deserves to be \nhunted, all stealth forgotten in the panicked flight from righteous cleansing \nviolence. There are no names among the pack, no words, only a razor-keen \nunity of purpose, a shared loathing of the sickly scent of the one they chase. A \nmutual determination that their quarry does not deserve to live. \nIf any were able to form the words to express them, no doubt the crimes listed \nof their prey would be as varied as the pack themselves, and some, perhaps, \neven true. But that is not important, not really. Not the driving, pounding need \nbehind the hunt, what spurs pursuit of tooth and claw is not some calmly made \nassessment or solemn judgement on the weight of the hunted's sin. It is the \nneed to tear and rend and coat their faces slick with the blood of the guilty \nthat pulses through every fibre of them. The thumping need inside their head \nto hate, and to be right within that hate. To taste the blood of those that have \ndeclared themselves deserving of it. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 176 – Blood Ties \n11 \nBut as the pack runs, each and all among them are afraid. Of what? The \npounding in their heart drowns out the unease, makes it hard to taste and feel \nit out, but it is there. Are they afraid of their prey, fleeing in abject terror, their \ntrail marked clear by the scent of fear? No, it can't be. But what else could it \nbe? Surely not their packmates, sprinting along beside, leaping, jumping, \ngrinning in anticipation, moving as a group, their minds as one, never looking \neach other in the eye. \n[Distant fall into undergrowth] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nUp ahead, the quarry trips, cries out, tumbles to the floor in a desperate heap. \nThey try to stagger to their feet but they are caught in the undergrowth, ankle \ntwisted, vines wrapped around it. They already lost their boots, and now their \nbare and muddy foot is trapped, flesh and dirt and oozing blood, the blood \nthat fills the nostrils of these hunters, and drives their furious chase with the \nawful scent of its transgression. Tears flow, too, but no one notices, and no \none cares. Their punishment is at hand. \n[Rustles of undergrowth as the runners come to a stop; from \ndifferent directions, every so often a twig snaps from their \nmovement] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nIn moments, the prey is surrounded. The spaces between the trees are filled \nwith eyes that hate and hands that hold the promise of a life ended on the \nrotting leaves of the forest floor. They smile, and their teeth glint in the \nmoonlight, still red with all that remains of their last morsel of prey.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 2, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 3888}}
