Exactly no reason to up and vanish \nfrom his job without telling anyone where he’s going. They started a search of \nthe Marlborough Forest, they informed local police, they started discussing the \nbest ways to publicise the disappearance. \nI’m sure you can guess where this is going. Through it all there was this dark \nlittle suspicion growing in my mind. I never saw any evidence for it, not really. \nNothing that would stand up in court, but even so, the suspicion grew into a \ntheory, which grew into a certainty. That pig, that monster still squatted in my \nsty. The lock hadn’t been damaged or left open, so it was hard to see how it \n\ncould have gotten out to attack a clown, or even how Angus might have gotten \nin. But I know he did. I know that thing killed and ate him. \nI keep having this dream. I used to watch the rehearsals for the Carley \nBrothers’ performances, and I can clearly remember Angus Dale’s voice, or at \nleast his clowning voice. I was watching him perform, but instead of a comedy \nskit or a bit of slapstick, he would sink his teeth into his limbs with this \ncrunching, cracking sound, gradually eating himself. But even with a mouth full \nof meat, his laugh was still clear as a bell, his jokes and pleas for mercy clearly \narticulated. He never gave any sign he was in pain, but every few seconds he \nwould stop laughing or chewing, and just repeat the words, “Long pig. Short \npig. Wide pig. Narrow pig,” before starting up again. \nWhen I finally managed to drag myself out of bed the next morning, there was \na bright, white, human femur on the ground in the pig sty, lying in front of the \nenormous fleshy form that just gazed at me in horrid triumph. \nI didn’t want to tell anyone. That would have brought investigation, the police, \nefforts to exterminate the man-eating thing that looked so much like a pig. It \nwouldn’t go how they expected, I was sure of that, and I didn’t know what to \ndo. Would it kill more people if I just left it alone, or if they tried to kill it? I \nnever had much call for ethics before really, it was just… grapes and pigs. And \nwhen faced with that choice, I found myself completely paralysed. \nAfter about ten minutes standing there in silence, staring at that bone, I \nwalked into the pen, and I lay down motionless in front of the monster pig. \nThinking now, that decision seems alien to me, but I think I just couldn’t stand \nthe thought of going any further in the story that was playing out in front of \nme. It smelt awful on the floor, and as the pink form began to move towards \n\nme, my resolve started to waver. It was far too heavy to be supported by its \nskinny, twig-like legs, but something still propelled it slowly forward, inch by \ninch, that familiar pink drool leaving a thin path for the enormous body to \nfollow, until it was right on top of me. \nI closed my eyes and gritted my teeth, waiting to feel the pain of it starting to \ntear into my flesh. But instead, I felt it settle next to me, the meat of it sinking \ninto the spaces left by my position. It was pressing up against me, and let out \nthe most contented sound I have ever heard from a pig. \nThe message could not have been clearer: ‘Friend’. \nI don’t know how long I lay there in that stinking pig sty, listening to the calm, \nrelaxed breathing of the murderous thing that had chosen to spare me. \nEventually it retreated to its corner, and I stood and walked back into the \nhouse. \nIf you hadn’t turned up that evening, I don’t know what I’d have done. I know a \nmonster pig wasn’t what you were looking for, but I do appreciate your advice. \nWhen you explained the situation, I hoped you’d have some special trick for \ndealing with it, but I suppose welding scrap metal around the pen and filling it \nwith cement just about works, even if I do owe Mason a favour for borrowing \nhis mixer. I’d have thought the thing would at least try to break free while I did \nit, but… thank heaven for small mercies, I suppose. \nA huge block of solid concrete. What ought to do with it? Some sort of \nengraving, maybe? “In memory of Toby”? I can’t very well put it up “In \nmemory of Angus”. That’s what really gets me, to be honest. Those pigs didn’t \ndeserve what that thing did to them. Tearing them apart and eating them. \nNeither did Angus, of course.
