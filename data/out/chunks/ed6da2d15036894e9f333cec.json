It had two \nfloors with a loft that was going to be another bedroom, to match the rest of \nthe road. The doors had been fitted, although the locks had not, but the empty \nspaces where the windows were due to be still stood vacant, letting in the chill. \nThat side of the road backed on to South Park with fences marking the bottom \nof each garden. The garden of this particular house was mostly full of building \nmaterials and debris, but I remember that standing over it all was a tree. It was \nvery large and very dead and not to put too fine a point on it, the thing \ncreeped me right the hell out. It seemed to cast odd shadows, which were dark \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG008 – Burned Out \n3 \n \nand clear on even the most overcast of days. But it wasn’t the tree that started \nit, though. No, that happened my third night on the job. It must have been 8 or \n9 in the evening, as it had been dark for a couple of hours. I was working on \nthe ground floor wiring when I heard a knock at the front door. At first I \nthought it must have been one of the other builders who had forgotten \nsomething, but then I realised that there was no lock on the door; any of the \nothers would have known that and just come right it. I began to feel slightly \nuneasy, when the knock came again. Over the years I’ve had a few altercations \nwith punks that wanted to cause trouble on my sites, so I picked up a hammer \nas I approached. I did my best to hold it casually, as though I’d just been using \nit. \nI opened the door to see an unassuming man in a tan coat. He was quite \nyoung, white, maybe mid-twenties, clean-shaven with shaggy, chestnut brown \nhair. His coat was quite an old cut; it seemed to me he looked like something \nout of an old Polaroid. He said his name was Raymond Fielding and that he \nowned the house. As he spoke, I felt my grip on the hammer tightening \nalthough I have no idea why. I asked him if he had any ID or documents and he \nhanded over to me what seemed, as far as I could tell, to be the deed to the \nhouse, as well as the land beneath, and did indeed list a man named Raymond \nFielding as the owner. So I let him in. \nI apologised for the draught and said the window panes were being put in over \nthe next few days but until then it was going to be cold. He didn’t respond, just \nwalked over to the empty frame of the back window and stared out into the \ngarden. I tried to get on with my work, keeping one eye on this stranger. \nNothing about the situation felt quite right, but he didn’t seem to be doing \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG008 – Burned Out \n4 \n \nanything suspicious, just standings there, looking into the garden. So I returned \nmy concentration to the wiring. \nAfter a minute or two, I became conscious of a sharp, unpleasant smell. I \nthought maybe I had wired something up wrong, but no, it smelled like burning \nhuman hair. I looked over to where Raymond had been standing but he was \ngone. Where he had been there was just a patch of scorched wooden floor, \nstill apparently smouldering and giving off that dreadful stink. I ran to get the \nfire extinguisher from an adjoining room. I was gone only a few seconds but \nwhen I returned the smell was gone and there was no longer any smoke or fire, \njust the burn mark on the wooden floor in front of that window. Touching it, I \nfound that it was just as cold as the rest of the floor. I started to clean and \nfound that the wood below appeared to be undamaged with just a coating of \nsoot and ashes on top. I had a look around for this Raymond Fielding but if he \nwas ever truly there, then he was gone now. It was only when I had finished \ncleaning up the mark that the true strangeness of the situation began to sink in \nand I started to panic. \nI should probably explain my fear a bit, as it wasn’t because of ghosts or \nphantom smells or anything like that. You see, there is quite a significant \nhistory of schizophrenia among the men in my family. My father had it, as did \nmy great uncle, and in both of their cases it led to suicide. I didn’t know much \nabout my great uncle but I had seen my father’s decline first hand. It had \nstarted shortly after his divorce from my mother, although thinking about it; it \nwas perhaps the early stages that had exacerbated the problems in their \nmarriage. Regardless, he began to spend a lot of time locked in his study doing \n“his work”. I was maybe 24 or 25 at the time and still living at home.
