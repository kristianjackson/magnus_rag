I really considered myself retired, \nresting after a life spent defending the world from the darkness. Because that’s \nwhat I thought it was, you know? Vampires were what lurked in the dark. The \nonly thing that lurked in the dark. Last year though, just before my diagnosis, I \nmet something that made me re-think this. \nI’m sure you don’t need me to tell you that winter’s a hard time to be \nhomeless. Doesn’t matter how many times you’ve done it, when that first cold \nwind blows through you, it’s like some awful debt coming due. The last one \n\nThe Magnus Archives –056 – Children of the Night \n10 \n \nwas really bad. A bunch of the shelters I normally hit up had closed up shop \nand those that were left tended to fill up fast. I do pretty okay, given I’m a well-\nknown face and all that, but I still felt the pressure to scrape enough cash \ntogether to secure my spot early. Even then, there’d be a couple of times a \nweek that I still ended up in the cold. My old bones don’t do so well at that \nthese days, so I was keeping quite a close eye on the comings and goings \naround the night shelters of Manchester and after a few weeks I started to \nnotice something strange. \nSeveral times, at a couple of different shelters, I watched one of the sleepers \nget up in the middle of the night, gather their possessions and walk out into \nthe freezing streets of the city. To see it happen once would have been \nstrange, but to see it happen several times was surreal. I was sober at the time, \nso I couldn’t even pass it off as a trick of the mind. Even stranger, every time it \nhappened, within ten minutes a woman would walk in and take their place. It \nwas the same one every time. She must have been about 40 and slender, \nthough her clothes bulged a bit in odd places. Her face was lined from what I \ncould recognise as a hard life and a thin layer of grime matted her hair. She \nlooked pretty normal for the place and I could even write off the distant, \nneutral expression as the sort of trauma all too common among my people. \nThat’s why I didn’t pay her any mind the first time it happened, or the second. \n\nThe Magnus Archives –056 – Children of the Night \n11 \n \nWhen I noticed it happening a third time, I finally started to pay attention, \nthough I didn’t approach her immediately. I did ask about her the following \nmorning, but even the staff didn’t seem to know anything. I decided to keep a \nlook out and if she turned up again, I would confront her. \nWell, she did. It was late January when it happened, about two in the morning, \njust when the night was at its coldest. I saw one of my fellow sleepers get \nslowly out of bed. His name was Craig, I think. I didn’t know him well; he was a \nseasonal drifter and we’d only occasionally crossed paths. Well, he walked out \nwithout a sound, gathering up his belongings quietly and leaving an empty bed. \nI waited, wide awake, hand on my knife, breathing steady. Sure enough, a few \nminutes later in she walks, no backpack or gear of any sort and sat on Craig’s \nbed. I stood up and walked towards her. \nAs soon as she saw me, her posture changed and she became defensive, \nalthough the expression on her face never changed from that blankness. I \nstarted to introduce myself and ask how come she was taking over Craig’s bed, \nwhen she locked eyes with me. The weirdest sensation began to flow through \nme. I wanted to leave. It wasn’t like with a vampire where I would feel like I’d \nbeen spoken to. This was just a sudden awareness of my own desire. I’d been \nsober for three years at that point, but I felt like I desperately wanted to get \nhigh and I knew that the best place to get some was out in the night.
