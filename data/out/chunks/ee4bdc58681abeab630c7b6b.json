What do you think? \nAre we going to have to kill John? \nALSO MARTIN \nI don’t know because you don’t know. But it seems like something we should \nat least consider. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 186 – Quiet \n \n18 \nMARTIN \nI… have thought about it. And... I won’t. I don’t think I could. \nALSO MARTIN \nMm-hmm. \nMARTIN \nBut anything else? Any other price? I’ll pay it. \nALSO MARTIN \nEven dying? \nMARTIN \nYeah! \nALSO MARTIN \nJohn’s as bad as we are. He wouldn’t let it happen. \nMARTIN \nIt’s not his decision. \nALSO MARTIN \nFine. So flip that round, then. What are you going to do when he tries to \nsacrifice himself, because you know he’s going to try? \nMARTIN \nI don’t know all right? I don’t know. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 186 – Quiet \n \n19 \nALSO MARTIN \nAnd that’s okay for now, but I just want us to have thought about this stuff \nproperly before it comes up. Because even if that’s not it, chances are it’ll be \nsomething else you don’t want to do, and we need to make a proper choice. \nWe can’t just react out of shame or fear or whatever. \nMARTIN \nWhat, like with Peter and Elias? \nALSO MARTIN \nYes. \nMARTIN \nThat was a proper choice?! I chose wrong! \nALSO MARTIN \nBut you made a decision. Your own decision. Regardless of the outcome. \nMARTIN \nI… I’ll think about it. \nALSO MARTIN \nWe’ll think about it. \nMARTIN \nSure. \n(Another sigh) \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 186 – Quiet \n \n20 \n[Martin sips his tea] \nMARTIN (CONT’D) \nWhat about the people here? \nALSO MARTIN \nWhat people? \nMARTIN \nI don’t know. My... ‘prisoners’, I guess? \nALSO MARTIN \nWhat about them? \nMARTIN \nWhy haven’t we talked about them? \nALSO MARTIN \nBecause you didn’t want to think about them. So, we didn’t. \nMARTIN \nYeah? Well, I want to now. Consider it a ‘proper choice’ if you like. \nALSO MARTIN \nOkay. \nMARTIN \nCan I see them? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 186 – Quiet \n \n21 \nALSO MARTIN \nNo. This place is about hidden, unnoticed suffering. \nMARTIN \nI can feel them though. \nALSO MARTIN \nSure, you’re aware of it, dimly. A sort of far-off, lonely terror. But there’s no \nway for us to actually see or hear them. \nMARTIN \nHmm. But… if this is my domain, can I fix that? Like, can I change things? \n(Small sigh from Also Martin) \nALSO MARTIN \nIf you wanted to start actively tormenting them, I’m sure this place would \noblige. But ‘fixing’ things? Making it easier on them, or freeing them… probably \nnot. \nMARTIN \nFine. \n(Beat) \nCan you tell me about them? \nALSO MARTIN \nI can. Deep down we do know what’s happening to them. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 186 – Quiet \n \n22 \nMARTIN \nDo we know who they are? \nALSO MARTIN \nWe never met them in the old world. Although one of them is named Tim. Just \na coincidence, I think, unless it was a subconscious thing on our part. \nMARTIN \nTell me. Please. Like John would. \nALSO MARTIN \nWhy? Just so you can torture yourself? \nMARTIN \nI want to know the exact limits of my guilt. \nALSO MARTIN \nFair enough. \nI can’t tell you their names, because we don’t know them. Who they are, who \nthey were, these details are lost to us. But they’re also lost to them. \nSometimes they get flashes, moments of people they might have been. \nPhantom pasts, the ghosts of happy futures, but they’re empty, and vanish if \nthey try to hold them. \nOne of them is young, though he has always felt old. He has always felt tired. \nHe has stood apart from everyone who ever cared for him and never felt the \ndistance. His family were cold, and so to keep that coldness at bay, he built a \ntowering wall between them and him. He hid it in jokes and practiced smiles,", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 3, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 3562}}
