I like to keep an eye on \nthem. Besides, wanted to give her some space, you know? But yeah, living \noutside the Institute, it’s just not safe anymore. \nARCHIVIST \nWhat about Martin? \nBASIRA \nI think he’s still got a place? He’s not down here, anyway. \nARCHIVIST \nRight. So, how, how does thi— \nBASIRA \nDo you want to get on with this or what? \nARCHIVIST \nYes, right, sorry. You, uh, you managed to get some anaesthetic? \nBASIRA \nHere. The guy said it was a nerve block, should numb pretty much the whole \nleg. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 125 – Civilian Casualties \n \n12 \n \nARCHIVIST \nRight. Right. Was it hard to come by? \nBASIRA \n(Sarcastic) No, I just popped down Superdrug. Yes, it was hard to come by. \nARCHIVIST \nAnd you couldn't get any general anaesthetic to knock her out fully? \nBASIRA \n(Sarcastic) Oh, sure. Did your spooky brain tell you the right dosage to not kill \nher? \nARCHIVIST \nN-no. No, it didn’t. \nBASIRA \nThen it’s got to be the local. Here, get on with it. \nARCHIVIST \nWhat, me? \nBASIRA \nYeah. If she comes round she’s going to kill someone and, you know, not it. \nARCHIVIST \nFine, give it here. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 125 – Civilian Casualties \n \n13 \n \nBASIRA \nThe guy said you’d need to hit the right nerve for it to work. Do you know \nmuch about— \nARCHIVIST \n(Confidently) Here. \nBASIRA \nYou sure? \nARCHIVIST \nYes. \nBASIRA \nOkay. Go for it. \nARCHIVIST \nRight. \nBASIRA \nAnd pray the injection doesn’t wake her. \nARCHIVIST \nYes, thank you, Basira. You’re sure we shouldn’t just... tell her? \nBASIRA \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 125 – Civilian Casualties \n \n14 \n \nI really don’t know how she’d take it. Not well. If we want to get it out of her, \nthis is it. \nARCHIVIST \nOkay. \n[Melanie stirs at the injection but does not wake] \nRight. How long does it take? \nBASIRA \nAbout half an hour, he said. \nARCHIVIST \nRight. \nBASIRA \nYou'd better be right about this. \nARCHIVIST \nI am. \n[Tape clicks off. Tape clicks on] \nARCHIVIST \nRight, pass me the scissors. \nBASIRA \nWhat? I thought you had a scalpel? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 125 – Civilian Casualties \n \n15 \n \nARCHIVIST \nFor the trouser leg. \nBASIRA \nOh, right. \n[Sound of fabric cutting] \nARCHIVIST \nGod. Look at that. \nBASIRA \nI don’t... It’s a leg. \n[Static rises] \nARCHIVIST \nNo. Inside. \nBASIRA \nI don’t know what you’re seeing, John. \nARCHIVIST \nIt’s... Christ, it’s all rotten. \nBASIRA \nCan you see the bullet? \nARCHIVIST \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 125 – Civilian Casualties \n \n16 \n \nYes. \nBASIRA \nYou ready? \nARCHIVIST \n(Bitter chuckle) No. \nYou’re sure you don’t have restraints, or…? \nBASIRA \nYou think she’s gonna sleep through being tied down? I’ll try and grab her if \nshe wakes, but... \nARCHIVIST \n(Sighs) Okay. Here we go. \n[Sounds of impromptu surgery and nervous breathing. Clang of metal on \nmetal, followed by relieved sigh from the Archivist.] \nMELANIE \n(Screaming) Get off me! \n[Extremely loud commotion as Melanie springs up and attacks the archivist] \n(Everyone starts speaking/shouting/screaming simultaneously) \nMELANIE \nGet off me! \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 125 – Civilian Casualties \n \n17 \n \nARCHIVIST \nWoah, Jesus! Basira, she’s awake! \nBASIRA \nMelanie! It’s okay. It’s okay. I’ve got you. \n \nMELANIE \nDon’t touch me! \n[Melanie’s anger is being physically expressed] \nARCHIVIST \nBasira, watch her hands, watch— \n[Wet, fleshy sound of stabbing] \nArgh! Argh! \nMELANIE \nI’ll kill you. I will kill you! \nBASIRA \nMelanie! \nARCHIVIST \nIt’s alright! It’s just— \nBASIRA \nJust go!", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 5, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 3644}}
