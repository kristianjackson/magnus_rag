Right. Keep saying it’s not meant to trip whenever one bulb goes, but \n“No, John, I don’t want to bother the landlord.” (Sighs.) Ah. \nORSINOV \n(Sing-song) You don’t want to do that. \n(The Archivist gasps.) \nORSINOV \nI mean, you can if you really want to, but you’re not going to like it. Sometimes \nnot being able to see something is actually quite a good thing. \nARCHIVIST \nWho are you? \nORSINOV \nWell, my father called me Nikola, and then I killed him, so I thought I rather \ndeserved to have his second name too. Which makes me Nikola Orsinov. \nPleased to meet you at last. \nARCHIVIST \nYou, um... You killed Gregor Orsinov? \nORSINOV \n\nYep! He got really boring, and I’m a monster. I mean, what do you want me to \ndo – not pull him apart? I did use all the bits. \nARCHIVIST \nI... Y… Y-You don’t… sound Russian. \nORSINOV \nHow could I sound anything, silly? I’m plastic. \n[The sound of tapping on plastic.] \nI don’t even have a voicebox. I had to borrow this one. \nARCHIVIST \nUh... \nORSINOV \nDon’t turn on the light. \nARCHIVIST \nA-Are… Are you going to kill me? \nORSINOV \nNo! I mean, yes. But not for a good long while yet. I don’t want you to go to \nwaste. \nARCHIVIST \nThen, er… then, then what... Then why are you here? \nORSINOV \nAfter you attacked poor Sarah, I thought it was about time we had a good old \nchat. Face to no face! Eye to... well. \nARCHIVIST \nW… What do you want? \n\nORSINOV \nYou remember that old piece of skin you were talking about? We’d like it back. \nWe thought that mean old Gertrude had destroyed it. But then you went \nlooking, and now we think maybe she was just very good at hiding. \nARCHIVIST \nI’m sorry, are you asking me to find it for you? \nORSINOV \nThat would be lovely. And a lot nicer for you than our other ideas. \nARCHIVIST \nWhat is so important about some ancient bit of taxidermy? \nORSINOV \n(Happily) I want to wear it when I dance the world new. \nARCHIVIST \nBut… But wh—URK! \n[It sounds as if the Archivist has been hit.] \nORSINOV \nQuestion time is over, little Archivist. Find the skin for us. You have until... well, \nuntil I change my mind. \n[The sound of an impact – the Archivist gasps for breath.] \nShhh... Save your energy for the dance. \n[Footsteps over laboured breathing] \n[Tape clicks off.] \n[The Magnus Archives Theme – Outro.] \nJONATHAN SIMS \n\nThe Magnus Archives is a podcast distributed by Rusty Quill and licenced under \na Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Sharealike 4.0 International \nLicense.
