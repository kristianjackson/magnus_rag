Episode one hundred and fifty-one. \nBig Picture. \n[Tape clicks on. Faint sounds of footsteps approaching.] \nUNKNOWN \nOh! Hello. \n(Several long ‘hmm’s, then a satisfied ‘hm!’ followed by chuckling.) \nMARTIN \nUm, excuse me sir, sorry - you can’t actually be here. \nUNKNOWN \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 151 – Big Picture \n2 \n \nOh, not to worry! I seem to be doing alright so far. \nMARTIN \nNo, I mean - this area is actually off limits to the public, so - \nUNKNOWN \nAnd quite right to! Goodness, the things they could learn here turn your hair \nwhite, eh? (chuckles) Best to keep them out, I say. \n(The unknown person continues humming to themself.) \nMARTIN \n...who are you? did Peter send you? \nUNKNOWN \nYou must be Martin. Goodness, he was not exaggerating. \nMARTIN \nWhat’s that supposed to mean? \nUNKNOWN \nOh come now, don’t be like that. Let’s start over. \nSimon. Simon Fairchild. Peter asked me to look in on you and have a small chat. \nWell, a big chat, really. Answer all those nagging questions. \nMARTIN \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 151 – Big Picture \n3 \n \nSimon Fairchild? Wait, Simon Fairchild as in- \nSIMON \nAs in, all those people who said I did horrible things to them and their loved ones? \nYes. They have been in, haven’t they? I’d hate to think I’m underrepresented in \nhere, not when Peter tells me that that bone fellow has at least half a dozen - \nMARTIN \nNo, no, not at all. you’ve sent plenty of people our way. \nSIMON \nBrilliant! So shall we get started? \nS-sorry, I’m still not entirely clear what’s going on. What are you doing here? \nSIMON \nI see. I suppose it was a bit much to expect him to have filled you in on everything \nalready. I mean, in many ways, that’s the point. \nMARTIN \nRight. \nSIMON \nSo you’ve been working with Peter for a while now, correct? \nMARTIN \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 151 – Big Picture \n4 \n \nSure. \nSIMON \nAnd he’s been promising you answers to all those difficult questions? \nMARTIN \nI mean, sort of. \nSIMON \nWell, that’s me. \nMARTIN \nWhat? \nSIMON \nYes, well you have to understand how it is with Peter. He finds talking to people \ndirectly very difficult, especially explaining the more, um - esoteric side of things? \nCharming chap, I’m sure you agree, absolutely lovely, but even if you can convince \nhim to actually give you a straight answer, he’s just not that good at actually \nputting these things into words. Something to do with his upbringing, I think. \n(Conspiratorial whisper) I’m pretty sure he was home-schooled, you know. \nMARTIN \nSo what, he sends you to answer questions because he doesn’t want to? \nSIMON \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 151 – Big Picture \n5 \n \nPrecisely! \n \nMARTIN \nAnd you do it? Why? \nSIMON \nIs that your first question? \nMARTIN \nIs there a limit? \nSIMON \nOnly until I get bored, and that does tend to come more quickly these days. \nMARTIN \nO... okay, okay then, sure, sure. First question then. Why are you helping Peter? \nDon’t you serve different, you know, fears? \nSIMON \nWell, now see… that’s actually two questions. The answer to the first is simple. I \nlost a bet, and this is how the good captain chooses to use that. The second is... \nsort of? I mean yes, if you want to get technical, he serves the One Alone and I \nserve the Falling Titan, but those two are a lot closer than you might imagine. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 151 – Big Picture \n6 \n \nAfter all, the larger the space you find yourself alone in, the more isolated you \nfeel. \nMARTIN \nAnd being aware of how lonely you are can make anywhere feel more empty. \nSIMON \nExactly. I’ve actually been toying with the idea of trying to do something with the \nscale of humanity itself, you know, emphasize all that overpopulation nonsense. \nBut honestly it just doesn’t ring true for me. We’re all just so tiny and pointless, \nyou see, it’s hard to really get past it. Also, I worry it might be straying into \nterritory that emboldens our potential new rival. \nMARTIN \nThe Extinction. \nSIMON \nThe very same. Peter said you’d have a lot of questions about that one. \nMARTIN \nI do. How are new powers born? \nSIMON \nHmm… don’t know. \nMARTIN", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 0, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 4476}}
