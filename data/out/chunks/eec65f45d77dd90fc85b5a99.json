He stood upright on his spindly back \nlegs, attached to a disproportionately swollen abdomen. The rest of his legs \nwere splayed at odd angles, as though in the middle of some sort of dance, and \nhis head had no mouth, but was covered asymmetrically with eight eyes of all \nshapes and sizes. On the top of it there sat a small bowler hat, which had been \ndrawn in a splash of red ink, unlike the black and white which made up the rest \nof the image. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG081 – A Guest for Mr Spider \n6 \n \nI was a bit taken aback. I had seen plenty of children’s books that tried to be a \nlittle bit scary, or ended up being unintentionally disturbing, but this felt \ndifferent. There was something to this drawing, to this book, that I’d never \nseen before. A violence seemed to ooze from it, sticky and pungent. I had no \nidea what was inside, but I knew that I hated that book. And I knew that wasn’t \ngoing to stop me opening it. You know what was immediately inside the cover. \nIf you’re in a position to be listening to this, you know exactly whose mark was \nthere. \nThe book itself starts with a blank room in a simple house, almost entirely bare \nsave for a small table with a pot of flowers on it and two doors. The flowers are \ndrooping in a way that might just be a poor rendering of bluebells, but with the \nblack and white it just makes them look sick. \nIn the centre of the room stands the figure I take to be Mr. Spider, his arms are \nstill splayed wildly, and his back is turned to the reader. He is staring, it seems, \nat the door on the left. On the next page the image is identical, save that the \narms are now in different places. The third and the fourth are the same again. \nThere is no text on any of them. \nThen, on page five, the words ‘KNOCK KNOCK’ appear next to the door in the \nsame style as the words of the title. Mr. Spider’s arms are suddenly straight \nand still by his side. The text comes again: ‘WHO IS IT, MR. SPIDER?’ \nThe door opens, and stood there is a thin, scrawny looking fly clutching a box. \nIt is crudely dressed in an ill-fitting suit. It is hard to tell from the fly’s face, but \nhis attitude seems to be one of trepidation or anxiety. ‘IT’S MR. BLUEBOTTLE’, \nthe text reads, ‘AND HE’S BROUGHT YOU A CAKE’. The next page is a close-up \nrendering of a large slice of cake in a box; it does have colour, but it’s a pale \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG081 – A Guest for Mr Spider \n7 \n \ngreen that makes me think of disease. Then comes a page showing the \ninsectoid face of Mr. Bluebottle, the worry now stark etched there. Then there \nis a page with no picture at all, just the words: ‘MR. SPIDER DOESN’T LIKE IT’. \nThen the book returns to the room. Both doors are once again closed. The only \ndifference between this image and the one on the very first page is the ink that \nseems to have been spilled on the lower half of the right-hand door. There are \nseveral more pages of Mr. Spider waiting, his arms a windmill of activity. \nThen another ‘KNOCK KNOCK’ on the left door, and Mr. Spider goes rigid. \n‘WHO IS IT, MR. SPIDER?’ In that position it’s clear his belly is even larger than \nit was before. The door opens on another fly, this one slightly larger, wearing a \npale yellow dress. ‘IT’S MRS. FRUIT’, the book announces, ‘AND SHE’S \nBROUGHT YOU SOME FLOWERS’. The flowers on the next page look even less \nhealthy than the ones on the table, and are coloured with a gentle pink. A \nclose-up on her face, frozen in stark fear. ‘MR. SPIDER DOESN’T EAT FLOWERS’, \nthe next page announces, and Mrs. Fruit is gone, the door closed again. \nThe right-hand door is more noticeably stained now; the once-black ink now \nseems like a dark, crusty brown at the hinges and the seams. The flowers \nbrought by the doomed fruit fly now stand on the table, but they are more \nclearly wilted and stained a deep, vivid red. Mr. Spider’s abdomen is engorged \nand straining, and where his mouth would be is marked by the same dried \nbrown colour as the door. His arms are moving once again. \nOn the messier page, with more colour to contrast it, I can see that his hands \naren’t empty, but are weaving and pulling on thin grey threads, that st", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 2, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 4500}}
