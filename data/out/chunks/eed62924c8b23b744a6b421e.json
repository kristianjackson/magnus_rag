There wasn’t a door and then there was. \n[TAKES A CALMING BREATH] \nI worked for Wolverton Kendrick. I still do, I suppose. I haven’t officially quit, \nbut I haven’t been back there since this happened. We mostly sell properties \naround the Wimbledon area, sometimes as, as far out as Colliers Wood. We \nspecialise in well-appointed, family homes for successful professionals looking \nto move further out of London. We’ve had a lot of success and these days \nusually have anything up to 200 properties on the market. Most of them are \ndetached family homes or big, well-appointed flats. \nI’ve been with the agency for about eight years now and I’ve done thousands \nof viewings for them, so believe me when I say there was nothing unusual \nabout that house on St Aubyn’s Avenue. I mean, maybe the fact the owner was \nselling it for less than two million? Even though it, it still wasn’t suspiciously \ncheap, it was just a lovely house in a good area, like every other house I sell. \nWhen I think back to driving there, the trees seemed darker than they should \nhave been... the other houses sit there, sinister, behind their tall gates and \nempty driveways, but I think... oh, that’s just my memory changing to fit what I \nknow now. At the time, I don’t think I felt anything except annoyance that I \nwas going to be two minutes late to the viewing. You know what’s funny? Even \nafter everything that happened, I actually have trouble picturing the house in \nmy mind. It was so much like all the others. So unremarkable. And it’s not like \nI’ve been back. \nFor most of the morning views it was business as usual. I had the usual stream \nof bankers and executives asking the standard questions, occasionally livened \nup by a private dentist or a barrister. I walked around that house for the better \npart of five hours, and by the end I’d been in every room and opened every", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 0, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 3914}}
