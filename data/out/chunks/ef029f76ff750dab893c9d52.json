Didn’t say anything ‘bout talkin’. \n \nARCHIVIST \nLook, we’re on the same side. \n \nJULIA \nIf you’re telling the truth. \n \nARCHIVIST \nI mean, I don’t know what proof I can give you. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG109 – Nightfall \n \n2 \n \n \nJULIA \nWell, if you’re right about it, it won’t be long until “Officer Mustermann” over \nhere is able talk again. That should be illuminating. \n \nTREVOR \nHe’s almost got his lungs again, if you can call ‘em lungs. \n \nJULIA \nAs long as they can push air, it’ll do. \n \nARCHIVIST \nAnd if you don’t like what he has to say? \n \nJULIA \nThen this cabin is a long way away from anything can hear you. \n \n(Trevor and Julia chuckle) \n \nARCHIVIST \nA-and if I run? \n \nTREVOR \nWe’re very much hoping that you do. \n \n(Trevor and Julia chuckle) \n \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG109 – Nightfall \n \n3 \n \nARCHIVIST \nI read your statement, you know. You, you don’t kill people, only monsters. \n \nTREVOR \nThe line gets blurrier every day. \n \nARCHIVIST \nWhat about you, Julia? Following in your dad’s footsteps? \n \nJULIA \nHm, it’s a legacy I’ve learned to be proud of. There are people who would sell \nus all out for things you can’t even imagine. I’m happy doing what it takes to \nstop that. \n \nARCHIVIST \nMurder? \n \nJULIA \nWhy not? Everything dies. You think if you walk out of this cabin you just keep \ngoing? Something gets you, even if it’s just time. Mostly though, life on this \nplanet ends violently. It’s the most natural thing in the world, and sometimes it \nmakes the world a better place. \n \nARCHIVIST \nAnd when something comes for you? \n \nJULIA \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG109 – Nightfall \n \n4 \n \nThen I die. \n \nARCHIVIST \nTh-that doesn’t scare you? \n \nJULIA \nEvery second. \n \n(Gurgling, gasping noise, someone struggling to breathe) \n \nARCHIVIST \nC-can we keep that somewhere else? \n \nTREVOR \nI want it where I can see it. \n \nARCHIVIST \nAnd when you’re satisfied that I’m not trying to harm you? \n \nTREVOR \nIf you’re right about that ritual, I guess you talk to Gerard. \n \nARCHIVIST \nYou said he was dead. \n \nJULIA \nHe is. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG109 – Nightfall \n \n5 \n \n \n(Trevor chuckles) \n \nARCHIVIST \nRight, so we just... wait. \n \nJULIA \nThat’s the plan. \n \nARCHIVIST \nRight. \n \n(More gasping sounds) \n \nARCHIVIST \nPerhaps, if all we can do is listen to this... regrowing itself. May I suggest a way \nto pass the time? \n \nJULIA \nSure. You want our story? \n \nTREVOR \nGave you folks plenty already. \n \nARCHIVIST \nI m-mean, yes, but the situation has changed quite a bit. Last I heard you were \ndying of lung cancer. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG109 – Nightfall \n \n6 \n \n \nTREVOR \nI was. \n \nARCHIVIST \nAnd now? \n \nTREVOR \nI’m not. \n \nARCHIVIST \nAnd that doesn’t strike you as... odd? \n \n(Another struggling breath) \n \nTREVOR \nNot much I see these days isn’t ‘odd’ somehow or other. Not going to turn my \nnose up at the one bit of it that worked out well for me. I hunt monsters; my \nlungs don’t kill me. Seems like a fair trade. Maybe God did it. \n \nARCHIVIST \nWhat about you, Julia? C-care to make a statement? Maybe about, uh, how \nyou met Trevor? \n \nJULIA \nSure. Why not?
