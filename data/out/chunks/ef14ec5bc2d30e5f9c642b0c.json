And now I stare at it and not a \nword of it is even enough to fully describe the fact that I itch. Because ‘itch’ is \nnot the right word. There is no right word because for all your Institute and \nignorance may laud the power of the word, it cannot even stretch to fully \ncapture what I feel in my bones. What possible recourse could there be for me \nin your books and files and libraries except more useless ink and dying letters? \nI see now why the hive hates you. You can see it and log it and note it’s every \ndetail but you can never understand it. You rob it of its fear even though your \nweak words have no right to do so. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG032 – hive \n7 \n \nI do not know why the hive chose me, but it did. And I think that it always had. \nThe song is loud and beautiful and I am so very afraid. There is a wasps’ nest in \nmy attic. Perhaps it can soothe my itching soul. \nJONATHAN SIMS \nThis is... uh... Excuse me, reading that was, um... hmm. While I am pleased that \nwe have… found the statement that Prentiss gave the Institute, it answers far \nfewer of our questions than I would have hoped, and gives us little new \ninformation about her than we had before, save for a snapshot of her mental \ncondition before her hospital admission. We were already aware of her \nreligious history, and her breakdown over an ant infestation that apparently \nled to her termination from her work at the Good Energies spiritual supplies \nshop in Archway. \nThe wasps’ nest is interesting. The paramedics report claims that when they \nand the police responded to reports of screaming at Miss Prentiss’ flat on \nProspero Road, they found her in a loft space, passed out, with her forearm \nburied up to the elbow in “pulped organic matter”. This could indeed have \nbeen a wasps’ nest, I suppose, but no nearby residents reported to have seen \nany wasps in the area. Unfortunately, it could not be examined further, as later \nthat night there was a fire that completely destroyed the flat and killed the \nlandlord, Arthur Nolan. The fire service determined he had fallen asleep with a \nlit cigarette, due to the fact that he was found sitting in the remains of an \narmchair, with no sign he had made any attempt to escape. \nMiss Prentiss was taken to the Emergency Department at Whittington \nHospital, but she was already showing signs of the... infestation that would \ncharacterise her later appearances. Six hospital staff were attempting to treat \nand sedate her, when many of the worms were violently expelled from her \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG032 – hive \n8 \n \nbody. They quickly burrowed through the soft tissue of the medical personnel \n– eyes, tongue, et cetera – and into the brain, killing them after roughly a \nminute and a half. She then walked calmly out of the door to A&E. A nurse \nattempted to run, but in his panic he tripped on the stairs and broke his neck. \nThen she was gone. The Institute was consulted, as apparently during her \nadmission she had claimed that she was being possessed, but it was decided \nthe situation was medical in nature and our involvement was dropped in \nfavour of, what I can only describe, as a cover-up. If we’d known about this \nstatement, perhaps things might have been different, but here we are. \nStill anyone who’s familiarised themselves with her file could tell you this. We \nstill don’t have any evidence that Prentiss is actually paranormal. It could just \nbe an unknown, aggressive parasite. There are weird things out there that are \nperfectly natural. It’s not, though. I know it’s not natural. Somehow I... I feel it. \nI’m sorry, my academic detachment seems to have fled me. Something in this \nstatement has got to me a bit. I’m… I’m going to go lie down. \nRecording ends. \n[The Magnus Archives Theme - Outro] \n \nThe Magnus Archives is a podcast distributed by Rusty Quill and licensed under \na creative commons attribution, non-commercial share alike 4.0 international \nlicense.
