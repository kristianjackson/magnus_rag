I thanked you when you handed it to me, \nbut I don’t know if you’ll remember. I wonder, will you… forget you lent it to \nme and believe that it was my pen all along? Maybe instead you’ll forget that I \never had one to begin with, and think of me as an idiot who turned up to give a \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG038 – Lost and Found \n2 \n \nstatement without a pen, so you had to lend me yours. My own fault for \nputting it down, really. Assuming I did ever have one. I’ll try to keep a slightly \ncloser hold on this one. \nI’ve been in the antiques business for a long time. It’s not what it used to be. \n[Nervous chuckle] I’m sorry, I know. I always did that, try to make myself feel \nmore comfortable with jokes. There’s a follow up to that one, you know. \nSomething along the lines of the joke being so old only an antiques dealer \nwould be able to sell it. I love that one; I think it’s clever, but in my whole life \nit’s only ever gotten a laugh once. That’s why I remember buying the vase so \nclearly. I remember that the seller laughed. \nIn the old days, I never would have considered buying wares from the likes of \nMikaele Salesa. He has a good reputation for quality, but a… bad reputation for \nlegality, as it were. I’ve had more than one acquaintance sell on a particularly \nvaluable find they got from him, only to discover that it didn’t have proper \nimport papers, or that it had been reported stolen years before. Charlie Miller \neven did some jail time over a Georgian brooch he bought off him, so as a \ngeneral rule I’d have given Salesa’s stuff a wide berth, but... Well, the antiques \nbusiness isn’t what it used to be. That isn’t a joke. I had to close up my shop a \nfew years ago, you see. Actual antiques don’t sell to the mass market anymore. \nOh, young people will snap up vintage clothes or have any number of cheap \nfaux-antique replicas strewn about their living rooms, but as soon as they get a \nlook at the price tag for the real thing? They’re out of there like a shot. \nSo I went the same way as a lot of my peers. Lose the premises, start selling \nonly high-margin goods direct to specific clients who can afford them, or shift a \nfew guaranteed sellers on the auction. It’s the only real way to stay afloat in \nthe business nowadays, but the competition is intense, and getting the calibre", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 0, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 3178}}
