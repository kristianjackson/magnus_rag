An appropriate gift and one \nthat serves to provide a certain distance from things. Of course, a paltry few \ncenturies is nothing really, but it’s more than most get. And even in that brief \ntime, I’ve seen all sorts of ebbs and flows to the balance of things. Do you know \nwhen the last ritual I attempted was? \nMARTIN \nI - I don’t know, that space station? \nSIMON \nOh goodness no, that’s the future, my boy! No. It was 1853, the height of the \naquarium mania. All over the empire, people were starting to understand the \ndepths of the terrible unknown below the ocean, and I thought that was a rich \nvein to be tapped. Even bothered old Harley into helping me design a special \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 151 – Big Picture \n10 \n \ndiving bell for the ritual. I called it the Awful Deep, and between you and me I was \nrather proud of myself. \nMARTIN \nSo why didn’t it work? \nSIMON \nBecause it wasn’t a very good idea. The fear wasn’t out there, not like I hoped it \nwas. All sort of fizzled. Also, a Hunter broke in and destroyed the mechanism, sent \nme and all my sacrifices plummeting to the bottom of the ocean. \nMARTIN \nI don’t see your point. \nSIMON \nMy point is... \n...you know, I’ve quite forgotten. \n(Martin sighs in frustration.) \nSIMON \nHey, I’ve just not been doing much recently, it’s not a good time for perspective \nyou see. The world all feels too small these days. I used to do a lot for the religion \nbut it’s just not got the same conceptual scope that used to. honestly I’m pinning \nmost of my long-term hopes on space, but that’s at least a hundred years away. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 151 – Big Picture \n11 \n \nMARTIN \nAssuming the Extinction doesn’t derail everything. \nSIMON \nWhich is why I’m happy helping Peter. But if it does, then I’ll either be dead, \nwhich will be fine, or I’ll adjust. \nMARTIN \nIt doesn’t scare you? \nSIMON \nMartin. Taken on a cosmic scale we’ve never even been alive, not in any way that \nmight register. I mean, if this dreadful little planet had a fractionally different \norbit and life had never even started here, then ultimately nothing of any real \nimportance would have changed. \nMARTIN \nI think our experience of the universe has value. Even if it disappears forever. \nSIMON \nWhat a lonely way to look at things. Which makes sense I suppose. \nMARTIN \nSo what do you do then, if - if the world is pointless and your God is so weak right \nnow? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 151 – Big Picture \n12 \n \nSIMON \nI have a good time, and do my best to avoid the drama. It’s all been getting a bit \nmuch over the last few decades, I blame the number of people. from our own \nnumbers point of view it’s getting very busy. more Minds equals more fear after \nall. \nMARTIN \nI thought you said that the maths doesn’t work. \nSIMON \nOh, you are a quick one! So maybe I’m wrong. But crucially I suspect a lot of the \nother servants and creatures out there have a similar idea. probably while they’re \nall in such a rush to make their own attempts. \nMARTIN \nYou make it sound like the entities don’t even know what they’re doing. \nSIMON \nI have no idea if they’re doing anything at all. if they’re even capable of ‘doing’ \nthings. I know that most of their servants are simply doing their best to interpret \nand serve something that is almost definitively inconceivable. \nMARTIN \nYou can’t be serious. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 151 – Big Picture \n13 \n \n \nSIMON \nAll right. Let’s try one of those analogies Peter finds so annoying. Erm… imagine \nyou are deaf, but every night you hear the most beautiful music in your dreams, \nand your every waking thought is consumed by trying to reproduce that music. \n(Oh, you’re mute as well in this analogy, or at least you can’t sing.) And you need \nto invent the idea of a musical instrument from scratch. Everyone else is also deaf \nand mute, and -- \nMARTIN \nYes, I think I get it. \nSIMON \nYes, well the point is, most of us are trying so desperately to recreate our own \ndream symphony that we bring an awful lot of our own baggage into the mix. \nMARTIN \nWhat about the monsters? \nSIMON \nWhat monsters? \nMARTIN", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 2, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 4094}}
