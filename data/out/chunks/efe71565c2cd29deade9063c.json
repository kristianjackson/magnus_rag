I saw a figure walking \naway, through the door to one of the clerk’s offices. It was short and wide and \nI could see the wood of the floor bow beneath its huge boots. It wore a tall, \nblack hat and only the thinnest wisps of grey hair were visible below. In its \ncoarse, ruddy hand, it held a hard-worn black cane tipped with iron. Then the \ndoor closed behind it and it was gone. \nI followed into the room behind it, but it was empty. There was no sign of the \nman, or whatever it was, that had gone in before me. The window was sealed \nand there was nowhere for someone of that size to hide. Still I searched. I \nwasn’t sure what else to do. Even the heavy boot prints seemed to have \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG050 – Foundations \n8 \n \nvanished. What I did manage to find, however, fallen behind one of the writing \ndesks, was one of George Gilbert Scott’s workhouse designs. \nThere is, of course, no way to be certain of any connection between the two \nevents, but that did little to quell the scalding rage in my breast as I strode out \nof my door the next morning. I took a cab to George’s office, where I was \ninformed that he was at his workhouse site with Moffatt, and took another \ncab. I found the site in a state of some commotion, with my former assistant \nstanding next to a high stone wall, arguing with a labourer who seemed quite \ndistraught. He was gesturing wildly at an area of the wall, while another man, \nwho I assumed to be Moffatt, tried to calm him down. \nAs I approached, I began to make out what the labourer was saying. He was \nasking after someone he referred to as ‘The Governor’, while Moffatt was \ntrying very patiently to explain that no governor had yet been appointed to the \nworkhouse. The labourer didn’t seem to be paying this point much mind, \nhowever. He kept repeating that the Governor had come to see Harry. He did \nnot say who Harry was, but I assume an acquaintance of his. He said he knew it \nwas the Governor because of the jangle of his keys. He said that the Governor \nhad called Harry idle. \nIt was at this point I was finally close enough to see the wall he was pointing at \nwith such excitement. As first I thought they were worms, small and pale \nagainst the brickwork. But as I got closer, I saw them clearly. Extending from \nthe unblemished, solid stone of the workhouse wall, were four fingertips. \nThe labourer repeated it again. The Governor had called Harry idle. I returned \nGeorge’s documents and left. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG050 – Foundations \n9 \n \nI trust you will understand now, Jonah, why I have been avoiding the company \nof my fellows these last few years. I have always been reluctant to make any \nnotation of my story, but now that I finally have everything prepared for my \nmove to New Zealand, I would feel like I had slighted you had I left without \nsharing my tale. Do with it as you will. I am done with it. \nSincerely yours, Sampson Kempthorne. \nJONATHAN SIMS \nStatement ends. \nObviously trying to trace disappearances and deaths in Victorian workhouses is \nan exercise in futility, so I’m loathe to even try. More importantly, who is \nRobert Smirke? I have read every book I can find on the man, which is \nadmittedly not many, and none of them show any sign of this other side to \nhim, apparently at the heart of strange buildings and architecture all over \nLondon. And now what? Students? Apprentices? \nIf Henry Roberts was a student of some sort of paranormal construction \nmethods, it doesn’t appear to show up in any of his buildings, save perhaps for \nFishmongers’ Hall, which he designed along with Sir George Gilbert Scott for \nthe Worshipful Company of Fishmongers in 1834. It is reportedly a hotbed for \nlow key hauntings, but nothing of the magnitude we’ve heard from others. \nScott is concerning, however. While Smirke seems to have built a handful of \nnotable buildings around London, Sir George Gilbert Scott is responsible for \nlandmarks such as St Pancras Station, the Albert Memorial and the restoration \nof Westminster Abbey. If his buildings have similar quirks, then... well, to be \nhonest, I don’t know what that would mean, but I doubt it would be good. That \nsaid, there have been no reports of any sort of paranormal or supernatural", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 4, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 4300}}
