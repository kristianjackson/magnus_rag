Vampires tend to go for \nthe smaller victims, those less able to defend themselves should the initial \nsurprise of their attack not be enough. This one really looked like he could take \ncare of himself. Still, as far as I was concerned, he had no idea what was about \nto happen to him, and as Dupont led him down a nearby alley, I hurried after \nthem. \nI was quiet as I limped through the rubbish that covered the alleyway and I \nsilently drew my trusty hammer. After a minute, they turned into a doorway \nand took out a key. The door opened and they both stepped inside. I had a \nsudden alarm at the thought of getting locked out and being unable to reach \n\nThe Magnus Archives –056 – Children of the Night \n8 \n \nhim. Forgetting stealth, I grabbed the door and flung it open. They turned to \nface me. I charged in with a cry, slamming the hammer into Dupont’s shoulder \nand knocking him to the ground with a sickening crack. \nI will never forget the moment I heard Alard Dupont scream. It was such a \npiercing sound and something I’d never expected. In a moment, everything I’d \nbuilt up in my head over the past couple of days shattered and I felt a sudden \npanic at what I’d done, what I was doing. His friend screamed as well and \nstarted run back out the door. I don’t know if he got a good look at me. Given \nthe police never came around to question me, I guess not. \nDupont was still screaming, that horrid sound overriding all other thoughts. \nBlood was streaming from his face where it had hit the ground and I didn’t \nknow what to do. I had to get out of there, but that noise was too much. I \ncouldn’t focus, couldn’t do anything. So, I hit him again. Hard. In the head. And \nthen he was quiet, and everything was horribly still. He just lay there. I have \nnever felt anything like the shame and disgust I felt at that moment. I tried to \nburn his body, more out of habit than anything else, but it didn’t really take, \nand I fled out into the street before the police arrived. \nAfter that I spent over a decade in a very serious spiral. I don’t remember \nmuch of it, except that I spent most of it so high that looking back, I’m \n\nThe Magnus Archives –056 – Children of the Night \n9 \n \ngenuinely astounded I never OD’ed. I only snapped out of it in ‘96, when a \nchance encounter with a creature that called itself Hannah Edwards led to my \nsaving a young woman from becoming its dinner. I won’t bother with details. It \nwas very similar to my hunt for June Lewis, except that the victim made it out \nalive this time. I wonder why it is that I only ever seem to find them just before \nthey attack? It can’t be that they spend every night feeding; the world would \nbe a bloodbath. Maybe they just blend in better when they’re not on the hunt \nand I don’t spot them? Or maybe they hibernate? It’s not a question I think I’ll \never be able to answer, but it does mean that there is always an urgency to the \nhunts that has, for the most part, stopped me doing much investigation into \nthem. \nHannah was my fifth confirmed vampire, and the last one, assuming I don’t \nfind another before the cancer takes me. I really considered myself retired, \nresting after a life spent defending the world from the darkness. Because that’s \nwhat I thought it was, you know? Vampires were what lurked in the dark. The \nonly thing that lurked in the dark. Last year though, just before my diagnosis, I \nmet something that made me re-think this. \nI’m sure you don’t need me to tell you that winter’s a hard time to be \nhomeless. Doesn’t matter how many times you’ve done it, when that first cold \nwind blows through you, it’s like some awful debt coming due.
