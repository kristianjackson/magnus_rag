You keep disappearing behind \ntombs and that. \nARCHIVIST \nI’ll try to slow down. \nMARTIN \nThank you. I really rather not end up lost in a... what did you call it? \nARCHIVIST \nA necropolis. It’s like a cemetery but all the tombs are above ground. New \nOrleans has a very impressive one. Or… had. \nMARTIN \nHmm. \nARCHIVIST \nIt’s usually for places where the ground floods often or is too swampy for \nburial. \nMARTIN \n(Sarcastically) Pffft, oh yeah, yeah, I’m sure this place is just here because of all \nthe flooding swamps. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 180 – Moving On \n3 \nARCHIVIST \nNo, obviously. This place is a manifestation of— \nMARTIN \nNo. Nope. \nARCHIVIST \nI understand.

No, no, I… I get it. \nMARTIN \nJust a little break. \nARCHIVIST \nThat’s fair enough. \nMARTIN \nIn fact, this time, when you start to... intone, I’m going to find a nice \nsoundproof mausoleum, and just, just chill with whatever horrors they’ve got \nlurking in there, y’know. Maybe play a bit of I Spy or something. \n(The Archivist chuckles) \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 180 – Moving On \n4 \nMARTIN \nI-I’ll start. I spy with my little eye, something beginning with... T— \nARCHIVIST \n(Immediately) Tombs. \nMARTIN \nCheater. \nARCHIVIST \n(Fake indignant) I did not! \nMARTIN \nYour turn. \nARCHIVIST \nFine. I spy with my little eye… Literally everything. \n(Martin laughs) \n(The Archivist laughs) \n[Low laughter comes from a nearby tomb] \n(Laughter stops with tense sighs) \nMARTIN \nRight. \nSorry. \nForgot. Levity is just… off the cards. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 180 – Moving On \n5 \n(Archivist noise of agreement) \nARCHIVIST \nHow are you doing? About... \nMARTIN \nYeah, yeah… Yeah. I'm… I don't know. I’m not sure how to feel. Just… pressing \non, you know? \nARCHIVIST \nI do. \n(Beat) \nMARTIN \nDo you think she'll be okay without us? \nARCHIVIST \nShe's made it this far. \nMARTIN \nYeah. \nI just worry. \nARCHIVIST \nYeah me too.

I said slow down. \nARCHIVIST \nS-Sorry. \nMARTIN \nHow exactly does a leg wound make you faster? \nARCHIVIST \nI just want to get through here quickly. \nMARTIN \nReally? It mean, it seems pretty calm apart from... Wait. Wait, wait. No, no, no, \nno, no, no. It’s not more children, is it? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 180 – Moving On \n7 \nARCHIVIST \nNo, no, no, the necropolis is fine. Uh, I mean, well, obviously it’s, it’s bad, i-i-it’s \nhorrible... \nMARTIN \nS-So why the hurry? Where are we going? \nARCHIVIST \nAh… well… \nMARTIN \nCome on, don’t play coy. \nARCHIVIST \nI’m not being coy, it’s just, well… \nMARTIN \nWait. Wait… are you excited? \nARCHIVIST \n(Enthused) A bit. Maybe. \nMARTIN \n(Suspicious) Why?
