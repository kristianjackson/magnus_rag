Three more were subdued and arrested, but as far as I know \nthey still haven’t said a word. God knows how they’re going to process them \nwith all the secrecy around the operation, but thankfully that’s not my \nproblem. I think they were connected to that cult group from way back, the \nChurch of the Divine whatever. \nARCHIVIST \nThe People’s Church of the Divine Host. Rayner was their leader back in the \nearly Nineties. I have a few statements related to them if you're interested. \nNatalie Ennis was actually one of the... \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG073 – Police Lights \n11 \n \nBASIRA \nNo. I’m not interested. Not even a little. I’ve been thinking a lot over the past \nfew days, and I’m done. \nWith the police, with Section 31, all of it. I wanted to tell you in person. And \ngive you the statement. It seemed the least I could do. \nARCHIVIST \nYou’re really quitting? \nBASIRA \nYeah. And you should too. This place... It’s not right. Goodbye, John. \n[Door opens] \nARCHIVIST \nBasira, wait. What about the tapes? \nBASIRA \nWhat? \nARCHIVIST \nThe tapes. Fr... from Gertrude’s case. Is there any way I can- \n[Door closes] \nNo, I suppose not. \n[Tape clicks off] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG073 – Police Lights \n12 \n \nWell, that seems to close the book on Maxwell Rayner. Maybe the whole \nPeople’s Church of the Divine Host. I can’t help but feel I’ve got the last \nchapter of a story and I don’t even know the title. At least I hope it’s the last \nchapter. I still can’t find much about the company Outer Bay Shipping. Looks \nlike a shell corporation, but tracking corporate ownership is not something I’m \nskilled at. \nI’m disappointed with Ms. Hussain’s decision. It’s not exactly a surprise, \nthough. I’ve... thought about quitting myself. It’s not an option, of course. I’m \nin far too deep now. I get the impression that to quit would be giving up \nwhatever small protection I seem to have here. I just wished... I don’t know. \nOddly enough, all I can think about is how did the police know where Rayner \nwas keeping the boy? Basira didn’t seem to know, and the Church clearly \nwasnn’t expecting the police to arrive. With a few exceptions, Rayner managed \nto stay off the grid for two decades. How did they find him now? \nSomeone must have known what was happening and tipped them off. And I \ndon’t think it was anyone inside that building. \nEnd supplement. \n[The Magnus Archives Theme - Outro] \nThe Magnus Archives is a podcast distributed by Rusty Quill and licensed under \na creative commons attribution, non-commercial share alike 4.0 international \nlicense.
