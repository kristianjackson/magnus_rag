The blanket was just there to keep me warm. Until \nlast week. \nThe mother of an old friend of mine, Robin Patton, called me out of the blue. \nNow, at that point I hadn’t really seen Robin in about three years, but she \nsounded close to panic so I listened. She told me she hadn’t heard from him in \nalmost a month, and was convinced something terrible had happened to her \nson. Apparently he lived alone, and I was the closest friend to Robin’s address. \nShe begged me to go over, and see if anything was wrong. \nI feel a bit guilty about how long I put off going, although in the end I guess it \ndidn’t matter. Robin and I hadn’t parted on bad terms or anything, he was just \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG086 – Tucked In \n8 \n \na bit dull, and I had no real wish to bring him back into my life. Still, I couldn’t \nnot check on him, not after that phone call. So, eventually, I drove the half \nhour over to his cheerful suburban bungalow. \nIt was almost evening by the time I got out, and as I walked up to the front \ndoor I noticed that none of the windows were lit. I was reassured, though, \nwhen I saw a shape watching me from the kitchen. I couldn’t really make it out, \nand it disappeared almost as soon as I’d seen it, but I managed to convince \nmyself that it was Robin, probably wondering why I’d shown up at his door \nunannounced. I kept telling myself there was no reason to feel so uneasy. \nWhen I reached the front door, I saw it was open, and shadows spilled out of it \nlike paint. \nIt wasn’t open so wide that you could have seen it from the street, but it was \nimmediately clear that something was very wrong with Robin Patton, and I \nalready regretted getting involved. I expected the door to creak when I pulled \nit, but the hinges moved in complete silence. Inside, everything was gloomy, lit \nonly by a few stray beams of sunset that had managed to slip in past the heavy \ncurtains. There was no sign of any figure watching from the window, but \nsomething in the light made the shadows seem as if they were moving. \nForwards and backwards, shifting to a beat that only they could hear. I \nfumbled for a moment or two, looking for a light switch, until I was able to flick \nthe ceiling lights on and the shadows retreated back to where they should \nhave been. \nInside, the place was an absolute mess. Robin had never been a tidy guy, but it \nlooked like it hadn’t been cleaned in weeks. A thin film of dust coated \neverything, and there was this rancid smell pervading the place, that I thought \nmust have been coming from the fridge. On the wall hung a calendar, still \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG086 – Tucked In \n9 \n \npinned to January. From the looks of things, he hadn’t been living there in over \na month. I was about to head out, and find a phone somewhere to call Robin’s \nmother, and then maybe the police, when I caught another glimpse of \nmovement. I saw through a crack in one of the doors that lead further into the \nhouse. This time it was a slow, languid motion, and I was absolutely sure that \nI’d seen it. \nI called out for Robin, or for anyone who might be in there to respond, but I \ngot nothing but that same thick silence. My heart was thumping so hard I could \nfeel my legs shake as I approached the door. I pushed it open, and reached for \na light switch on the wall. I found it, turned it on and… nothing happened. The \nroom remained completely black, and for the first time in almost twenty years \nI began to feel that childish fear of the dark. \nThankfully, I always keep a heavy torch in the car, in case I break down \nsomewhere at night, so I went to fetch it. The weight in my hand was \nreassuring and solid, as I walked slowly back and into the darkened room. In \nthe light I could see this was Robin’s bedroom. There was a small writing desk \ncovered with papers, a large oak closet, a single bed missing its covers, and a \ndoor to a small en suite bathroom in the corner. As I went in, I noticed the dust \nin here wasn’t as thick as in the rest of the house, and that the last entry \nmarked on his desktop calendar was the 12th of February. Empty food packets \nand bottles were strewn about the room and piled up in the corner. It looked \nas though Robin hadn’t left his bedroom in weeks. The rancid odour that I’d \ncaught wind of outside was stronger in here, and I no longer thought it was \ncoming from the fridge. \nSlowly and carefully I made my way towards the wardrobe. It was a stark, \nimposing thing: a good two feet taller t", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 2, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 4500}}
