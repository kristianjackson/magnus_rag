I know the statistics, how big the universe is, the \nprobabilities and proximities and the promises of other beings out there \namong the stars. But I’ve been there. There’s nothing. Nothing but empty, \nuncaring void, lacing dead worlds and dead stars all together like a tapestry of \nlonely meaninglessness. Humans have existed for the smallest sliver of a \nfraction of a moment in the existence of the universe and we will be \nextinguished just as quickly. And when we are at last gone forever into the \nquiet emptiness of death, there will be nothing left but the cold universe and \nnothing shall mark our passing because there is nothing to do so. Dismiss me if \nyou wish to, take comfort in your escapist fantasies of aliens and visitors from \nother worlds, but there’s no proof I can give you beyond the testimony of one \nwho has spent so very long staring into that black and empty infinity and \nknowing, truly knowing, what it means to be floating and forsaken in an empty \nuniverse. \nI knew isolation experiments could be rough when I signed up. I’m not some \nnaive fool who thought he’d endure a few quirky side effects for science. No, \nI’m an astronaut, so I do my research. When I was picked for the project, a \nlong-term isolation study set in conditions of low earth orbit, I read up on as \nmany previous cases and similar experiments from the past 30 years, \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 057 – Personal Space \n \n3 \n \nfamiliarising myself with possible side effects and likely psychological hurdles. \nIt was daunting to say the least. \nI wasn’t keen to experience some of what the previous tests seemed to \npromise would happen to my mind, but I didn’t feel like I had much choice. I’d \nhad my application to the International Space Station floating in limbo for so \nlong that when a private consortium approached me, telling me they’d \nrecently launch Daedalus, a small manned satellite of their own, and needed \nqualified crew members, I jumped at the chance to go to space at last. I should \nhave realised that what they meant by crew member was lab monkey, but to \nbe honest, even after I found this out, it didn’t do a lot to dampen my \nenthusiasm for the project. I was going to space. \nThere were two other people technically on the crew. I say technically, as I \nnever spent any time with them beyond the trip up to the Daedalus. Their \nnames were Jan Kilbride and Manuela Dominguez. I’m sure that they probably \ndid a lot more looking after the station than I ever did, but as far as I was \nconcerned, I was the only one up there. From the chatter I heard before the \nmission began, each of us had an experiment of our own to be concerned with, \nbut they were also there as a back-up in case something went horribly wrong \nwith mine, since the observing scientists simply didn’t have the option of \nintervening themselves.
