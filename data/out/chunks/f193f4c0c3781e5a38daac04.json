I’m not a doctor, so describing exactly what \nit did to the flesh it touched would serve no purpose except to start me having \nthe nightmares again. Let us just say that it gave a plentiful home for the flies \nthat swarmed around his body. \nWe looked at John Amherst, utterly appalled. He said not to worry, that the \ndisease that had claimed poor Mr. Miller wasn’t contagious. Even produced \nthe recently signed death certificate, though it was stained with some dark \ngrey fluid, so I did not examine it too closely. He then apologised that their air \nconditioning had broken. “I’m sure you know all about what heat does to \ncadavers,” he said. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG036 – Taken Ill \n9 \n \nI just wanted to get out of there, and have never been more grateful to \nwhoever designed care home beds so that we could remove the body with as \nlittle contact as possible. Even then, on the way out I felt a sudden tickling pain \non the back of my left hand, and looked down to see the thick leather glove in \ncontact with one of the patches of yellow. I nearly screamed and dropped the \nbody, but did neither. Ivy Meadows did not feel then like a safe place to do \neither of those things. In fact, I kept my composure through the whole of the \ndrive home. \nAs soon as we arrived, I ran into the bathroom, throwing my gloves into the \nmedical waste bin. I scrubbed the patch of skin that still felt like it was \ncrawling. I could see nothing wrong with it, but I kept scrubbing until it was \nbloody, then poured disinfectant over it until it went numb. \nWhen I finally left the bathroom, I found Josh arguing loudly with his father. \nApparently Uncle George was not satisfied with the explanation given for the \nstate of Mr. Miller’s body. He turned to me, and asked what had happened. I \ntold him the same thing Josh had, the same thing I’ve told you. We went over it \nslowly, point by point until finally he stood there silently, looking worried, but \ndetermined. He had us tell it to him one more time, before he nodded, told us \nto stay away from the corpse of Bertrand Miller, and left, telling us he had to \nmake a few calls. I have never seen a cremation done with such a quick \nturnaround, and he was burned before the end of the day. I asked Uncle \nGeorge about returning the ashes in a brass urn, but he shook his head, and \nsaid he’d already had them disposed of. \nI knew my uncle wasn’t one to share his thoughts when he didn’t want to, and \nthat seemed to be the end of it, save for those times throughout the day I \nwould feel that tickling in my hand and run to scrub it away. I went on a couple \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG036 – Taken Ill \n10 \n \nof other jobs, and it seemed like we were expected to forget it. Josh didn’t talk \nabout what happened, and I got the impression he was trying to ignore what \nhe had seen. He always was a practical soul. \nI… couldn’t let it go, though. It just kept playing in my mind. So when the \nphone rang two weeks later and I heard Alenka’s voice on the other end, my \nheart skipped several beats. What she said did nothing to allay my fears. The \nline was bad, very bad, but I could have sworn she said, “Come quickly. We’ve \ntaken ill. We’ve passed away.” The words repeated, as though on a recorded \nloop, though they were no easier to make out than the first time. Finally, I put \nthe phone down. I was technically off duty at that point, having just finished \nmy shift, so I could have ignored it. I could have walked away. Instead, I put on \nmy normal clothes, grabbed three pairs of gloves and got in my car. \nThe drive there was dreadful. Still hot, I kept looking at turnings and junctions, \nand imagining where I would go if I turned away from Ivy Meadows and just \ndrove off. But I didn’t. I kept taking those old familiar turnings, moving \ninevitably towards that sick, old building. When I arrived, it was quiet. The \nwhole building looked filthy now, even from the outside, and the plants that \nbordered it had started to take on an unhealthy whitish colour. There was one \nother car in the parking area, a faded white Transit van I didn’t recognise. I got \nout and started to walk towards the front door. The smell was noticeable even \nfrom out here, and by the time I got close enough to reach the buzzer, it had \nbecome so strong as to be unbearable. I tried to bring myself to press the \nbutton. But instead I turned and half-sprinted back to my car, desperate to \nbreath clean air", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 4, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 4500}}
