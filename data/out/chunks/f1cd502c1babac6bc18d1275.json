It had been the office \nof my old line manager, John Uzel, and he was inside. One of the dark black \nveins had snaked in through the window and seemed to have suspended John \ntwo feet from the floor, wrapped lightly around his throat. Like all the others \nhe was still, an image held in place, dangling and hanged by this pulsing mass \nof otherness. \nI awoke at that point. Normally, a nightmare would leave me a sweating, wide-\neyed mess, but that morning I felt invigorated. It came to me that, while the \ndream had in all ways appeared as nightmarish, I had never felt any true \ndiscomfort. Even my fall at the beginning had been curiously lacking in any true \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG011 – Dreamer \n5 \n \ndistress. I tried to put it from my mind as I searched through the jobsites, but \nsomething about the dream lingered, like a foul odour you only smell when \nyou’ve stopped thinking about it. \nI hadn’t seen John Uzel in several months. He had left the company some time \nbefore my breakdown and I had never known him that well, but the image of \nhis face in my dream wouldn’t leave me, so I resolved to find out why he had \nreturned to my mind in such an odd manner. For whatever reason, the idea \nthat there might be no cause for his appearance, that it may be entirely \nincidental, never occurred to me. I had been offered the chance to return to \nBarclays after my rather dramatic departure, once my mental health was in a \nbetter state, but at that point I couldn’t even take the Docklands Light Railway, \nas I’d get a panic attack whenever the train hit Poplar and the looming figure of \nthe Barclays building and Canary Wharf came into view. I had declined the \noffer but I still kept in contact with some of my now ex-colleagues, so emailed \na few of them to see if they knew how to get in touch with my old manager. \nIt didn’t take long to find out the truth. John Uzel had apparently hanged \nhimself following the loss of a bitter custody battle with his ex-wife. I’m sure I \ndon’t need to tell you that this shook me deeply. Again there was no question \nto me that it may have been a coincidence. I knew, I still know, that what I saw \nin my dream deliberately mirrored his fate. \nI don’t remember my dreams for the next few nights but I do remember that I \nhad that same dream again the following Saturday. It was the same in every \ndetail, except there were different people. Some remained the same but \nothers were new or had disappeared, and those that I remembered had faded, \nlike wallpaper left too long in the sun. Again, I began atop Canary Wharf, with \nthe light pulsing behind me, and once I was down I found myself able to \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG011 – Dreamer \n6 \n \ntraverse the city at will, watching all the figures wrapped in those throbbing \nveins. \nI returned to where John had been, and sure enough there he remained, \nthough faded to the point where if I didn’t know who he was already, I could \nnot have identified him. The tendrils that wrapped his throat were as dark as \nthey ever had been, though. Knowing now what I did about John, I could see \nthe deaths of each poor soul I saw as I wandered through the dream. The dark \nvines would clutch the head of the stroke victim, the lungs of a cancerous \nsmoker and would bury the car crash victims under the vastness of their bulk. I \ndid not go towards the hospital, as so many of those thick and rubbery lines led \ntowards it that I could see no space within that was not choked with them. \nThese dreams have been a regular part of my sleeping for about eight years \nnow. Even as life improved and I found a new job and place to live, believe it or \nnot I now work selling crystals and tarot cards in a magic shop, they continued \nto crop up a few times each month. If there’s one advantage to working where \nI do, it’s that I’ve been able to read every book on esoteric dreaming ever \nwritten but none of them even come close to what I have experienced. \nI tried to make peace with the dreams for some time, reasoning that as long as \nthey caused me no discomfort, they were harmless. This worked fine until I \nsaw my father in the dream, walking down Oxford Street, the pulsing veins \nclimbing up his leg and into his chest. I tried to warn him of course – asked \nleading questions on his health and how he was feeling, whether he’d been \ntired recently. I even went so far as to book him a doctor’s appointment, much \nto his annoyance. It did no good, though – ten", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 2, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 4498}}
