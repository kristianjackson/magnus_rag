And there’s place just opened. \nARCHIVIST \nYou’re serious? You’re going on a date with… the Dullard of Skull Mountain, \njust so you have an excuse to eat a shopska salad? \nGEORGIE \nI need my sheep’s cheese, John. No one else will go with me. You hate \nHungarian food. Jeff says it tastes too “Soviet”, apparently, whatever that \nmeans. Melanie says it’s too salty. Everyone I know has bad taste in food. \nARCHIVIST \nI don’t hate Hungari– Hold on. Melanie’s back? \nGEORGIE \nYou didn’t hear? \nARCHIVIST \nHear what? \nGEORGIE \nYeah, she… had a bad time in India.

Well, er, speaking of weirdos, I think you have a Hungarian \nmountain man to be courting. \nGEORGIE \nYes I do. I’ll see you later. Don’t forget the freezer. \nARCHIVIST \nI won’t. Have fun. \nGEORGIE \nEh, we’ll see. \n[Georgie leaves and the door closes.] \nARCHIVIST \nHmm?
