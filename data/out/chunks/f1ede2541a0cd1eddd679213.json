He \ntried to settle down on one of the smooth, orange chairs, bolted to a long iron \nbar to form a crude bench, but he couldn’t get comfortable. From underneath \nhis coat, he could hear it; the tiny, whispering mouth that had opened up on \nthe long Tube-ride over. \n[Wet eye noises restart along with a strange, muffled internal \nbody sound] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 194 – Parting \n \n15 \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \n“They’re going to laugh at you,” it hissed. \n“No, they won’t.” \n“They’re going to tell you, you’re a freak, a deviant. They’re going to put you \naway.” \n“They’re going to cut you out of me.” \n“So you can kill me again?” \n“I didn’t kill you.” \n“You might as well have. With your insolence. With your disrespect.” \n“Shut up!” \n“I’ll tell them. I’ll tell them all the horrible thoughts you keep deep inside.” \nMalcolm’s leg wouldn’t stop shaking. Somewhere, from deeper within the \nhospital, a laugh echoed— \n[Distant laugh] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \n—cold and tinged with a judgemental cruelty that he recognised so keenly. He \npulled his coat tighter and got up, stepping out through the automatic doors \nand out into the cold night. \n[Sliding doors open and the waiting room is replaced with camera \niris movements, and distant helicopters and drones] \n[Footsteps on pavement] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 194 – Parting \n \n16 \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nHe was going to have to do it himself. That was all there was to it. If a \nprofessional, medical option wasn’t on the cards then what other choice did he \nhave? \n[Footsteps pause, then pivot and continued walking] \n[Automatic doors slide open, followed by supermarket sounds; \ndistorted unpleasant muzak, checkout beeps, camera iris \nmovements] \n[Strange, muffled internal body sound restarts] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nHe hurried into the supermarket, the dull throb of his shoulder causing his \nright arm to hang stiffly by his side. There were no trolleys left, nor any \nbaskets, so he grabbed what he could, and held them to his chest, dreading the \npossibility they all might fall tumbling to the ground at any moment. Kitchen \nknife, paper towels, disinfectant, vodka, ibuprofen. \n[Sounds of pickup up grocery items] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nAs he walked through the huge aisles, that seemed so much longer than he \nremembered, he tried to ignore the looks of curiosity and disgust he saw on \nthe faces of the other shoppers. By now his shoulder was clearly swollen, \nlumpy and bulging under his coat. One woman simply stood there, and pointed \nsilently as Malcolm felt the tiny, stick-thin arm creep out from under his collar, \ntrying to push the thick coat out of the way. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 194 – Parting \n \n17 \n[Strong fabric rustles] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \n“Let me see, Malcolm. Let me see!” \nMalcolm ran out of the store, dropping his items as he went. All except the \nkitchen knife. \n[Running, with items tumbling; supermarket transitions to \noutdoors London again; running continues] \n[Keys being used in a lock, followed by door creaking open; gasps of \nbreath] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nThe flat was dark and silent when Malcolm flung the door open, and fell inside \nin a heap. The pain in his shoulder was now unbearable as he clawed his way \nover the grimy, matted carpet, hands sticky from the decades of unnoticed \ndirt. The only light in the room spilled out from the static of the old television \nscreen, casting his agonies in a pale and washed out cathode-ray glow. \n[Gasps of breath continue, strong fabric rustles of a fight; the \nmuffled internal body sounds and wet noises intensify] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nHis coat and the shirt beneath it were rags now, torn by the sharp, flailing \nfingers that reached out from his shoulder. Malcolm tried to breath, to \nconcentrate or centre himself, to find any way to carve out a moment in the \nchaos and think. But there was none.
