She instinctively \nswatted at it, batting it away. \n[Wet crunching impact] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nIt was softer than she expected, and warmer, impacting the wall with a gentle \npop, and leaving a sticky grey residue behind it. Carmen hurried down the \nstairs as the other cameras all focused on her, and the other doors on the floor \nbegan to open to see what all the fuss was about. \n[Hurried footsteps on concrete; cameras iris, doors creak open] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 188 – Centre of Attention \n \n16 \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nFrom the speed at which they opened, her neighbours must have been \nstanding just behind them. Waiting. \nShe took it two steps at a time going down, and almost tripped and fell twice, \nbut it was better than the lift. The lift was nothing but cameras and mirrors, \ninfinite reflections staring at each other out to all eternity and the endless \nmultiplication of four cameras to watch it all forever. No, she wasn’t going in \nthe lift. \n[Transitions to exterior door opening to urban London sounds \nincluding people talking] \n[Footsteps as she walks] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nAt last she was in the street, the air of the city close, dry and tinged with that \ngritty texture that always made her afraid she was going to have an asthma \nattack. Did she have one recently? There were memories, flashes of lying on \nthe ground, desperate for someone, anyone, to help. But they had just \nwatched silently. Some had taken videos. But she was here now, and she \ncouldn’t afford to have another attack today. She had somewhere very \nimportant to be. \nThe street outside was not crowded, which gave Carmen the briefest moment \nof hope. Perhaps she could make her journey in relative peace. \n[A camera iris, followed by two synchronised footsteps as \npeople turn; crowd talking stops, whispers start] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 188 – Centre of Attention \n \n17 \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nBut then the camera orb on a nearby pole swivelled to focus on her and, just \nlike that, every single person turned towards her as one. Her stomach dropped \nas one by one their faces lit up, taking on that unmistakable hue of \nanticipation; of recognition. Carmen could remember none of these people, \nbut there was no ignoring the fact that they definitely knew her and, more \nthan that, she was important to them. \n‘Oh my god,’ a young man said as she tried to walk past him, ‘it’s you!’ \n[Carmen’s walking stops] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nHe waited for a response, but Carmen had nothing to say, and as her feet \nlocked in place her mind could do nothing but recite at her a litany of her \ninadequacies, her failures, her regrets. What did he want from her? His smile \nturned into a sneer. \n‘I should have known,’ he spat, ‘what a disappointment.’ \n[Carmen’s walking restarts] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nCarmen tried to walk faster, ignoring the middle-aged woman who looked her \nup and down, not bothering to hide the judgement in her gaze. All she had to \nsay was, ‘Oh.’ \nA little girl implored for Carmen to play with her, huge eyes pleading, but she \ndidn’t have time.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 4, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 3314}}
