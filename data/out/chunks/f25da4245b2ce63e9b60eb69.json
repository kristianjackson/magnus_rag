It might just have been the way he looked at Benjamin, with his \nsquare white teeth bared in a mirthless smile. But somewhere between the \nwagon and the cave, I became convinced that our so-called guide had lured us \nup here with no intention short of killing us and eating our flesh. \nI had no time to communicate this thought to my husband, however, who still \nseemed woefully oblivious of the situation, and once we were inside the small \ncave, there was no privacy in which to discuss it. So, I just had to sit there, \nwatching Eustace Wick building a fire, as Benjamin tried to suppress his shivers \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 058 – Trail Rations \n \n10 \n \nand make conversation with the man who he still did not realise had turned \nfrom our guide into our captor. I simply watched and waited as the storm \nbegan to descend outside and the warmth of the fire was quickly overcome by \nthe icy chill of the wind. Night began to fall, and the fire was the only light, \ncasting long, dancing shadows upon the walls behind us. I could feel hunger \ngnawing at me and was sure that I was not the only one, but I had a strange \nthought that the bearded man squatting the other side of the flames was \nwaiting for someone to mention it, so I refused to do so. \nMy husband, of course, had no such reservations and began to bemoan our \nforgetfulness at leaving what little food we still had in the wagon. At this, \nEustace Wick’s smile – if it were even possible – got wider and he said that we \nhad all the food we needed. He stared into the fire and began to mutter \nsomething. It sounded like a prayer. I think he was, in his own demented way, \nsaying grace. I remember the words exactly. He locked eyes with Benjamin and \nsaid, “Come, meat, be my guest and let thy gifts to me be blessed.” \nAs he said this, a silence fell across the cave. The wind died and the shadows \non the wall stopped moving, as though they were watching the scene in rapt \nattention. Eustace Wick withdrew a long, sharp knife and stalked over to \nBenjamin, who made no move to defend himself. His eyes were wide, staring \nat the mad cannibal approaching him with a look of both fear and rapture. The \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 058 – Trail Rations \n \n11 \n \nwhole scene was so utterly unreal that it took me almost a full second to \nremember and draw my gun. \nAll through this journey I had kept my father’s caplock pistol hidden, tucked \ninside my crinoline. Benjamin knew about it, of course, but had obviously \nnever mentioned it to Eustace. Had I had a possibility of reloading it, I might \nhave drawn it earlier, but with only a single shot, and I a barely passible \nshooter, I knew that I needed to be sure of my moment. As it turned out, I left \nit too late, for even as I placed the barrel to the temple of the foul murderer \nand pulled the trigger, he drew the blade across my husband’s throat. There \nwas a terrific bang, a splash of brain and a spray of blood. The two men fell \ndead upon the floor, and I found myself alone in the silence of the icy night. \nI’m sure I need not tell you the tears that I shed that night, tears that were ice \neven before they touched the ground. I wept for my beautiful, stupid Benjamin \nand I wept for my own life, now most certainly lost to the cold and snow. And \nto hunger. It was as this last thought passed unbidden through my mind that I \nheard it. Very faint, calling softly, was the sound of Benjamin’s voice. I crawled \nover to him, for a second overjoyed that he might be alive, but as soon as I \ntouched his ice-cold skin, already beginning to turn blue, I knew that it could \nnot be so.
