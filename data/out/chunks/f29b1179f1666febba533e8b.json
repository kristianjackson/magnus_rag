I’m sure you can \nalways rely on having a true friend in me. I’ve been installed here some weeks \nnow, and I’m finding myself well-contented, my sexton duties keeping my time \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 152 – A Gravedigger’s Envy \n2 \n \nemployed such as I scarce have a chance to allow myself those dark thoughts that \nso concerned you when last we visited. \nIt’s a fine little church, and the Reverend is a good sort, though I’ll confess to \nfinding his gospel readings tending towards the dull of a Sunday service. Not his \nfault, of course. The Lord gave him that voice for a purpose, no doubt – but \nsometimes that purpose does feel like it might be providing me a few minutes of \nunearned slumber. Still, his conduct towards me has never been less than \ncompassion itself. Why, he told me not yesterday that he’d never seen the church \nshine like it had since I’ve taken over its maintenance. \n“Shine?” I says. “Sir, that’s a rare compliment when it comes to cleaning \nsandstone.” And he laughed heartily, though the joke was of no great \nconsequence. So you may rest easy knowing I am happy enough. \nMy troubled sleep, on the other hand, has not, of yet, resolved itself in any way to \nmy satisfaction. I work myself to exhaustion, cleaning, polishing and looking after \nthe church proper, and I tell you, when I lie abed I can scarce rise again for the \nweakness I leave myself in. And yet, sleep still eludes me. And when it does not, I \nwake as though my heart were trying to leap from my chest, and my throat were \nfull of dust and ashes. \nYou need not despair, Nathaniel, I know the bottle will no longer help, and my \nother labors keep the nights from bothering me as once they did, but I do find \nmyself longing for a true and proper sleep. \n(Pause) I tell a lie. There are some nights I find myself easily slipping to dreamless \nrespite, though you’ll think me a morbid soul for it. Those days I spent digging \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 152 – A Gravedigger’s Envy \n3 \n \ngraves in the churchyard – on those nights I sleep, if you’ll forgive the joke, the \nsleep of the dead. \nI’ve never quite known a rest like it. Perhaps it is the harder, more physical aspect \nof the task, or perhaps the quiet rhythm of it. There’s no echo as there is in the \nchurch, just the sound of pick and shovel hitting dirt. And when it’s deep enough, \nwhen you stand at the bottom, the noise of the world just… fades away to \nnothing. It is the sort of quiet that makes you feel as though the commotion and \nhubbub of life were but a terrible dream, and in sleeping you were waking up to \npeace. \nYou’ll laugh, Nathaniel, but I almost wrote that I hope I have a chance to dig more \ngraves. What a thought. No, I’d not wish that, for to dig graves one must have \nsomething to fill them, and the good Lord takes that at His own pace. You may \nsatisfy yourself I am content with the position you have found for me, and spare \nno concern for my well-being or the receipt of your charity. \nYour humble servant, \nHezekiah Wakely \nFebruary, 1838 \nNathaniel, something has happened to me. And I felt it only right to send a letter \nand let you know of it, being as your last letter expressed such a kind curiosity \ntowards my sleeplessness, and – what I mentioned to you in my earlier letters. \nMy nights have indeed been easier of late, something I may partially ascribe to \nthe recent outbreak of fever in the town – taking more of my time for the grim", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 0, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 4085}}
