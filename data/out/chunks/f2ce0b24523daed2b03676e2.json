God, I wish I was there \nnow, locked in my cabin, staring over the quiet emptiness of the open ocean. \nBut it’s moored now, and I came on land at Elias’ request. My crew is out there \nwaiting for a call I think I am now unlikely ever to give them. \nI will call him Elias, for that’s how I’ve known him for most of our acquaintance, \nthough I originally met him when he was still James Wright, head of The \nMagnus Institute. I considered him a dull little man at first, so keen to watch \nother people’s misery, to lose himself in second-hand pain and drama, exactly \nthe sort of thing I’d always been so keen to avoid. Gertrude was the one that \nscared me. She seemed to have no interest in meeting me whatsoever, \nsomething I appreciated, but there was something in her eyes when she \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 159 – The Last \n \n13 \nlooked at me, as though she was making a calculation, and I was an unwanted \ninteger she was deciding whether to remove. It wasn’t until much later that I \nrealised exactly how true that was. Still, it seems I was never a pressing enough \nconcern for her to sail out after me, or even wait until I made port and waylay \nme. I suppose even she couldn’t have predicted how it would all turn out. \nThinking about it now, perhaps one of the reasons I lasted as long as I did was \nthat I was, at the end of the day, predictable. A known quantity. I had my little \npatch, sending my poor lost sailors to their forsaken end, but I rarely stepped \noutside of it. When I think of all those I met who travelled in this secret world \nwe’ve found ourselves in: Gertrude, Simon, Mikaele, even Raynor, there are \nplenty whose lives might well have been easier with my death, but it was rare \nthat I strayed outside my habits. Maybe that’s why, when I crossed paths with \nAdelard Dekker, we ended up talking, and he told me his theory of the \nExtinction, something that stayed with me even after he died pursuing it. \nThe thing is, the loneliness I crave, that fills my heart with that reassuring \nunease, relies on distance from other people. But a world without people at \nall, or at least anything I would recognise as people, it is meaningless. Without \nthe lighted window in the distance, how am I to see myself apart from it? No, \nsuch a world would be terribly dull, and scares me in a very different way. A \nfear I am happy to offer up, of course, but one that I would prefer not come to \npass. My instinct was much like the others, I thought that if I could complete \nmy ritual first, then the potential birth of the dreadful change would be \nmeaningless. \nI started it shortly before Simon convinced me to join him in his little space \nexperiment. It was interesting, of course, but in the end a tremendous waste of \nmoney just to scare a single astronaut.
