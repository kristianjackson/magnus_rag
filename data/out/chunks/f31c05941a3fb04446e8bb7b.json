I have no idea what, if anything, the \ninvestigation turned up. Certainly I was never contacted by them again, and if \nany of the rest were, they didn’t mention it. \nAnd for a while, that was it. We kept an eye out whenever we were heading \ndown Lancaster Road, but didn’t encounter any further ominous garbage bags. \nI thought maybe the involvement of the police had scared off whoever was \nleaving them. Maybe the police had caught the culprit and just hadn’t told us. \nI did start to notice, though, that Alan wasn’t doing well. He was often late to \nhis shift, and when he finally got there he’d be exhausted and grumpy, \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG005 – Thrown Away \n8 \n \nsnapping at everyone and rudely brushing off anyone asking about his health \nor how he was doing. He seemed even worse whenever we approached the \nend of Lancaster Road, sometimes speeding up the truck slightly so that we \nhad to run to keep up. Eventually, after I tripped over the curb while hurrying \nand twisted my ankle, I confronted him, told him that whatever was going on \nwith him, he could talk about it or get over it, but that he clearly needed to \ndeal with something. He got very quiet, and said he’d been watching number \n93 some nights. Said he wanted to see whoever was dropping this stuff off. \nThat he had to know. \nI don’t know what I expected. Trouble at home, maybe, or depression, but this \ntook me by surprise. I told him it was a really bad idea, that if the police were \nstill investigating they were more than likely to pick him up as the culprit, and \neven if they didn’t the old couple at 93 could just as easily get him arrested for \nharassment or stalking. Alan nodded along and agreed with me as I spoke, but I \ncould see he wasn’t listening. He just said again that he needed to know, told \nme he’d be careful, as though that was meant to reassure me. It didn’t, but I \ncould see I wasn’t going to talk him out of it and we ended in an uncomfortable \nsilence. \nWhat I didn’t say, is that I’d almost done the same thing myself once or twice. \nThere was something about this, beyond anything else I’d encountered, that… I \ndon’t know. It drew me in almost as much as it disgusted me. Almost, but not \nenough to do anything, and if I needed any further convincing that leaving it \nalone was the right decision, I only needed to look at Alan. As time went on, \nthe bags under his eyes deepened, and I’d watch him down half a dozen \nenergy drinks over the course of a morning, just to get through his shift. I could \nhave said something to our manager, but even then Alan was still my friend \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG005 – Thrown Away \n9 \n \nand I didn’t want to be the one to get him in any sort of trouble. Eventually, \nthough, it came to a head anyway. Alan fell asleep at the wheel of the truck \nand drove it into a parked car. No-one was hurt and the truck was going too \nslowly to do any real damage but, at that point, it was enough to get him fired. \nWe were sad to see him go, but to be honest, by the end of it he’d become \nquite unpleasant to be around and no-one shed any real tears over it. We got a \nnew member on our crew, a kid named Guy Wardman, and life continued in \nrelative peace. For a while, anyway. Then, on the 8th of August last year, at \nnine minutes past two in the morning, I was woken up by a text message from \nAlan. It said “FOUND HIM”. I texted him back immediately – What had he \nfound? Was it whoever was leaving the bags? Had he brought another one? No \nresponse. I texted Alan again to ask if he was ok. I sent that text a lot of times, \nbut never heard back. I tried phoning him but nobody answered. As the \nminutes stretched to hours, the worry that had been growing in my gut settled \ninto a grim certainty, and I knew that Alan was gone. I also knew that I had to \ngo to 93 Lancaster Road and see for myself. I got my coat and headed out into \nthe night. \nI walked slowly, with a kind of reluctance, so the sky was starting to get light by \nthe time I arrived. I knew what I’d find when I got there, and I was right. There \nwas no sign of Alan, or of whoever he might have seen. There was, however, a \nnew rubbish bag sitting there in its usual place. It was full, and this time the top \nof it had been tied off with a dark green ribbon, arranged in a bow like an old-\nfashioned Christmas present. It bulged in much the same way as the last one. \nI picked up the bag, which turne", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 5, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 4500}}
