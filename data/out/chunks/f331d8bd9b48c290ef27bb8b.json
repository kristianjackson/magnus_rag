Alex here, with a short message ahead of today's episode. \nThroughout this season, we have been taking a number of measures to ensure \nthat we can maintain production through the COVID outbreak in a safe and \nsustainable manner. Producing content under these conditions takes \nsignificantly more time and resources than normal, and as a result of this, we \nelected to split this final season into three acts. \nThis is so that we can have a short hiatus between acts, which allows us to \nease the pressure on our tireless production team and thus ensure that all \nepisodes are kept to our highest quality. \nToday's episode marks the end of Act One of this fifth and final season of The \nMagnus Archives. This means that, following this episode, we will be taking a \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 176 – Blood Ties \n2 \nsix-week hiatus, during which we will be releasing special content on our \nnormal, weekly schedule. \nThe story will continue with Act Two, which releases to the public on Thursday, \n3rd of September 2020. \nWe thank you for your patience and understanding as we take the time we \nneed to ensure that everyone working on this show stays happy and healthy. \nThat's all for now, apart from saying, as always, be kind to one another, and we \nhope you enjoy today's episode. \n[The Magnus Archives Theme – Intro] \nJONATHAN SIMS \nRusty Quill presents... The Magnus Archives. Episode one hundred and \nseventy-six: \"Blood Ties.\" \n[Theme finishes] \n[Tape clicks on] \n[Trees creak; every so often comes the cry of a hawk and a kestrel] \n[Backpack zippers jangle and the ground crunches as the Archivist \nand Martin walk through dense foliage] \n(In the following, Martin and the Archivist speak in hushed tones) \nARCHIVIST \nHold on, take it easy. \n[They stop walking] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 176 – Blood Ties \n3 \nMARTIN \nWhat? \nI'm going at a normal pace; you're the one that's slowing down! \nARCHIVIST \n(Adamant) I am not. \nMARTIN \nYou are! You're dragging your feet. What's up? \n(Beat) \nWhat aren't you telling me? \nARCHIVIST \nMartin, please. I'm trying to find our way to Basira. \nMARTIN \nTalk to me, John. \nARCHIVIST \n(Snapping) I'm fine. \nMARTIN \nGlad to hear. And the fact that we're hunting our friend in a domain of the \nHunt isn't getting to you at all? Not even a little bit? Hmm? \nARCHIVIST \nI don't like betraying someone's trust like this. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 176 – Blood Ties \n4 \nMARTIN \n(Gentle) It's not a betrayal if you're doing it to help. \nARCHIVIST \n(Rueful half-laugh) I'm not so sure. \nMARTIN \nLook, if it was me in her shoes, I'm sure I'd forgive you. It-it's for the best! \nARCHIVIST \nMm. \nMARTIN \n(Sigh) Look, you'll feel better about it when it's done. Okay, putting it off, it's, \nit's just going to make you feel worse. \nARCHIVIST \nMm. \nMARTIN \n…Besides, I thought the Hunt was meant to make you go faster. \nARCHIVIST \nDepends on the type of pursuit. Besides, the chase isn't really the point of this \nparticular place. \nMARTIN \nOh no? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 176 – Blood Ties \n5 \nARCHIVIST \nNo. \nMARTIN \nI can't believe I'm asking this, but what is the point, then? \nARCHIVIST \nHave you ever had your friends turn on you? People you thought you could \ncount on? \n(Short thinking exhales from Martin) \nMARTIN \nI mean... I-I worry about it, but, but, actu-actually, no? Not like a full-blown \nbetrayal or anything. \nARCHIVIST \nI'm glad. Because this place focuses on that worry, that fear of your own pack \nturning their claws on you. \nMARTIN \nHm. Is that... really a Hunt thing? \nARCHIVIST \nCan be. The old divisions don't mean as much these days. Maybe they never \ndid. The domains are... smaller, more, personal than the powers.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 0, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 3994}}
