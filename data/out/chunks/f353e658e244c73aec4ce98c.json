He won’t show \nme any ID. Why are they doing this? I didn’t do anything. The officers that \nbrought me here were friendly, kind. It was only after they left and it got so \nhot, and he started sitting across from me. He’s smiling, asking me questions \nagain and again. \n \nWhat were you doing earlier tonight? My job. I was doing my job, cleaning \nMoorgate station, me and Kelly and Vihaan. We’re the night cleaners, and \nthat’s what we were doing. We’d done the ticket office and the corridors and \nthe entrances, and we were getting started on the platforms. Why is that so \nhard for him to understand? \n \nHe laughs, and I wince as sweat drops into my eye. \n \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG107 – Third Degree \n \n6 \n \nWhen did you first notice something was wrong? We had just started work on \nthe platform itself, when we heard the tannoy come on. I don’t know how. As \nfar as I knew, it wasn’t even powered, but there was that slight crackle, and \nthen, “This is a security announcement”. We all waited, confused, but what \ncame out next sounded muffled, like it was coming up through five feet of \nwater. I couldn’t make out any of the words and, from the looks on their faces, \nneither could my colleagues. \n \nWe strained to listen, but after a few seconds it was silent again. We all looked \nat each other, and Vihaan started to shrug, when there came an incredible \nshrieking noise from the speakers. It felt like needles through my eardrums and \nit was all I could do to stay upright. I saw Kelly fall to the floor, clutching her \nhead. Then it stopped, completely, and we all looked at each other again, \ncatching our breath, trying to figure out who to report this to and, and how. \n \nHow did you become aware of the train? The first thing I noticed was the smell. \nEven before the noise or the heat, there was a sticky, greasy smell in the air, \nlike burning chemicals and spoiled bacon. I tried to figure out where it was \ncoming from, and realised it got stronger the closer to the tunnel mouth I \nmoved. By the time I reached the end of the platform I was almost gagging. \nThe others looked like they had mostly recovered from the screeching tannoy \nand were noticing my odd movements, and coming over to investigate \nthemselves. I saw Vihaan pull a face as he approached, and I pointed weakly to \nthe opening of the tunnel. I carefully climbed down onto the tracks, and looked \nout into the dark that led to Old Street. That’s when I saw it. \n \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG107 – Third Degree \n \n7 \n \nWhat did the carriage look like? It was hard to tell through the flames. They \nwere all over it, curling and writhing and crawling through the crevices in the \nwreckage. It wasn’t intact, though; parts of it were clearly crumpled and \nbroken, and I saw shards of steel and glass embedded in the wall that was lit \nby the dim red flames. \n \nWhat did it look like? There were people still inside. I could see them, arms and \nheads reaching out of broken windows and split metal, blackened and \nrendered almost unrecognisable by the fire and the heat. But they still moved, \nand twitched, and cried out in pain and terror, scratching at the edge of their \nburning metal tomb. But everything was choked and surrounded by a thick, \nacrid black smoke that stung my eyes and lungs, so nothing seemed the same \nfrom one moment to the next. \n \nWhat did it look like? It looked like Hell. \n \nWhat did you hear? Everything. The tunnel echoed and funnelled the sounds, \nuntil I could hear every agonised cry, every pop and crackle of the fire, the \ngroaning of metal that matched the groaning of the wounded and the dying. It \nall hit me at once, like the tunnel was pushing the tidal wave of sound out just \nfor me. The shape was perfect for a terrible screaming oven. From behind me, I \nheard the shouts of Kelly and Vihaan, though I don’t know if it was because \nthey saw it too, or because they saw me fall to my knees in horror. I could hear \nthe tannoy again, now clearly speaking: “Will Inspector Sands please report. \nWill Inspector Sands please report.” Over and over again. \n \nHe smiles, and the tiny room gets hotter.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 2, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 4164}}
