People would forget me, but that was alright, because only real \npeople care about who remembers them. And I was no longer among their \nnumber. I would have whole days where I failed to exist, a feeling so entirely \nalien that I am glad I had no stomach from which to throw up. And as I existed \nless and less, the man ceased to exist less and less… until… I remember the first \ntime he was really in my house, and I wished for nothing more than that I had \nhands with which to strangle him. \nMy parents were the worst. They came for dinner once, shortly after I had \ncalled to him. They looked so confused when I served them their meal, and the \nconversations would die after only a few words. My mother’s eyes were \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG085 – Upon the Stair \n6 \n \nbloodshot, and I could see them unfocus when they tried to look at me. She \ndabbed a napkin at her mouth and asked me where her son was. I asked her \nwhat his name had been. She didn’t know. She dabbed her mouth again and \nthe napkin came away bloody. \nMy father said nothing, as I had taken him up the stairs an hour before, and he \nnow lay dead in his chair, his heart unsuited for the expedition. He had sworn \nat me as he tried to climb them to the top, telling me I was no son of his, and I \nwas trying to agree with him, but if I could have done so, then he would have \nbeen wrong. Eventually, after almost an hour descending the spiral, he keeled \nover in his seat and lay lifeless. My mother got abruptly to her feet and told my \nfather that they were leaving. My father got to his feet, and silently followed \nher out. I never saw either of them again. \nEventually, the man who had never set foot upon my staircase became real \nenough to have done this to me. He existed so thoroughly that he was finally \nable to laugh at the joy of being. He looked around for me, but of course I \nwasn’t there, and in my absence I watched the realisation on his face that, in \nreality, whoever he was, he had died decades before. And he was now in \nreality. He tried to scream, but his throat decomposed around the noise, \ncutting it short with a slough of rotten flesh and collapsing, brittle bone. And as \nI stared from the empty spiral staircase, I wanted to laugh right back at him. \nBut I couldn’t, because I just wasn’t there. \nI haven’t been here for a long time now. Time is difficult. I try to take people up \nthe staircase. Sometimes they make it, sometimes they do not. None of them \nhave called out to me, though. Not like I once called out to an empty house. \nMost staircases are easy for me to not be on, but this one here took effort. I \ntried to be just real enough to talk to you. I wanted to share. I, I don’t want to \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG085 – Upon the Stair \n7 \n \ntake you up the spiral staircase, so you should try to leave. I don’t want to, but \nit’s my nature now, and you can’t fight what you are. Or even what you aren’t. \nAs I was going up the stair, \nI was a man who wasn’t there. \nI wasn’t there again today. \nOh, how I wish I’d go away. \nStatement ends. \nARCHIVIST \nThere are many aspects of this statement that I desperately want more \ninformation on, but I have no real way to do so. There are some short pieces of \ncorrespondence in the file, addressed to Gertrude, from someone called Eric \nDelano, confirming that while he typed out this statement, he has no memory \nof doing so, and requesting some sick leave to address persistent migraines he \nhas developed. There’s no supplementary research because… what do you \nresearch? A nonsense poem from 1922? \nNo, I am more interested, as before, with who is sending me these statements, \nand why this one, especially as the message, if indeed there is one, seems to \ncontradict the last one. If the… ‘moral’, shall we say, of Ms. Ashburt’s \nstatement was that ignoring the horrors stalking you just makes them more \ndangerous, then surely the message of this one is that confronting them \ndirectly is even more so. I suppose that leaves skulking around the periphery. \nWhich is what I was already doing! \nThere is, of course, a different reading, which is that this is a targeted warning \nabout trusting Michael, given the obvious parallels: swap out stairways for", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 2, "chunk_count": 5, "chars": 4238}}
