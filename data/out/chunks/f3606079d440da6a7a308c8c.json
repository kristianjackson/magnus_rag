Original Statement written 20th July 2018. \nAudio recording by Jonathan Sims, the Archivist. \nStatement begins. \nARCHIVIST (STATEMENT) \nFree will is a funny old thing, isn’t it, John? Can I call you John? I’m going to call \nyou John. Such a strange concept, woven together from a thousand different \nexperiences and ignorances, a faculty we only ever truly ascribe to ourselves \nand, I suppose, to our gods. With any other animal, we talk about instinct, we \ntalk about training. Perhaps, if we have spent enough time with them, we talk \nabout personality. But we never talk about choice. We never look at a dog \nracing wildly after a thrown ball and think, ‘What an odd decision that dog has \nmade.’ We talk about the workings of its mind and its instincts. If it doesn’t \nchase the ball, we wonder why. Is it sick? Is it tired? Perhaps something in the \nnature of this particular breed, this particular dog, makes it prone to ignoring a \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 147 – Weaver \n \n10 \n \ngame a fetch? The idea of a dog simply choosing not to chase feels deeply \nunnatural. Is it even capable of legitimately making a decision? Some would \nsay no. \nOf course, people are so very different from dogs. Our brains are larger, more \ncomplex; so many more little factors and wrinkles to push us and pull us. But \ndoes any of it actually constitute free will? Free of what? We all have forces \nthat drive us, circumstances that direct us, and even if we choose to ignore \nthese and act against all logic just to prove that we can, is that not simply \nallowing the existential terror of our own powerlessness to control us instead? \nScans show that decisions are made by your brain long before your conscious \nmind even has a chance to register them. Most of one's life is simply spent \nlooking back and convincing yourself that you chose deliberately to act like you \ndid. \nHave you ever read War and Peace, John? I know, I know. I had to read an \nextract from it for a literature class once, ended up reading the whole thing. \nAnother life. It’s not actually as boring as people say, and its central thesis is \nthat the tiniest most insignificant factors can control the destiny of the world. \nIn his postscript, Tolstoy muses on the concept of free will, on whether or not \nhe really believes in it. He ultimately decides that, if all the millions upon \nmillions of factors and influences that weigh upon our choices were fully and \ncompletely known, then all could be foreseen and predetermined. But, he \nargues, it is quite impossible for the human mind to comprehend even a \nfraction of these, and in that vast, dark space of ignorance lies ‘free will’. Isn’t \nthat marvellous, John? Free will is simply ignorance. It’s just the name we give \nto the fact that no-one can ever really see everything that controls them.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 1, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 3767}}
