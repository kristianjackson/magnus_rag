We punched tickets, \nignored questions, and threw off those that looked like they were having too \nfine a time of it. We didn’t like this job, too many sat aboard dreaming sweetly \nof progress and the future, too few alive to the truth of dirt and struggle in \nfront of them. We woke those we could, but too many stepped off with a \nsmile. \nWe had some luggage once, a thrumming, silk-wrapped thing of the Spider, \nhiding away in an old steamer trunk. We stepped heavy through the dining car \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 128 – Heavy Goods \n9 \n \nand found an old woman near the caboose. “Something strange in the luggage \ncar,” he said, and I finished as was our way, “You should come and see it.” She \nstood and walked with us readily enough, though tears flowed silent down her \ncheeks and patterned onto the faded carpet. The Spider’s always an easy job, \nno fuss, no complications, everything planned and prepared. It knows too \nmuch to truly be a Stranger but hides its knowing well enough to endure. We \nknew she wouldn’t scream as she was hollowed out and drunk, but still he \nthought best to cover the sounds with a laugh. He was always our humour. \nI remember our first automobile: black and reliable, just about presentable for \nthe London auction houses we served. He squeezed its first owner until they \nstopped, and dumped them in a river, and I stayed with the second until they \ndidn’t know who they were any more than they knew what they were. And \nthen we had a car. It was noisy and it juddered, but the name on the wooden \nsiding was respectable, and now it was ours and good enough for Sotheby’s. \nWe moved a lot of things in those years, some of them even harmless. \nMy favourite was the old knife, rusted from the trenches and lied about by a \nbarking auctioneer. We delivered it to a leering banker, who knew the second \nthey saw us what they’d done. Sweat dripped from under their bowler hat as \nthey took the knife from its dented metal case and screamed. They lunged at \nme, stabbing me over and through, then moved on to him. But he just laughed \nas the blade went in and out, and no blood flowed from the holes they cut. \nAnd when the banker had screamed all the curses they had learned from \nGerman gas attacks, the knife turned back again and cut them piece by piece \nby piece. We delivered it back to Christie’s, and that was the end of the auction \njobs. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 128 – Heavy Goods \n10 \n \nThen were the good times, the circus times. We always take what jobs are \nbefore us, deliver whatever will bring that fear and misery, but there is no joy \nin carrying meat, in shifting writhing spiral things. But with the circus, we were \namong our own kind at last. They all had names, true enough, but none would \ndare pretend that names were real. Faces changed more often than clothes, \nand nobody truly knew who anybody was, save for their function within the \nshow. We carried and lifted and helped the circus move towards its next \ndestination, the next doomed town. Sometimes we joined the show, lifting \nweights and things that looked like animals. Sometimes we lifted members of \nthe audience. Sometimes we even put them down again. \nEven in our stillness, people were afraid. The winter in Russia was cold, and in \nthe icy air the absence of our breath was clear for all to see. I could taste their \ndiscomfort, but none ever mentioned it. We didn’t like the puppet when \nOrsinov began to carve it. It seemed wrong to us to try and bring one like us \nabout, to create or remake it in such a solid, static shape. We were wrong, of \ncourse, and when Orsinov carved into the thing that had once called itself \nGrimaldi and fed the pieces they didn’t need to the shuddering organist, even \nwe found ourselves impressed. And when the faceless puppet peeled its \ncreator and moved itself with their tendon-strings, he looked at me and \nlaughed and laughed. \nWe followed her a while, but she was unpredictable, while we are things of \npoint and purpose. When she lost the ancient skin, we went our separate \nways, and found ourselves a lorry, long and dirty grey. We drove the \nmotorways and country roads and took great crates of nothing to and fro, \ndriving towards a different sort of terror. It wasn’t our cargo that brought fear \nthen.
