So, six of us at the moment. \nWell, I suppose three. Evelyn, Jamie and Debbie are already dead, so I don’t \nknow how much you’d call them ‘current members’, but you know what I \nmean. \nI really don’t know how it all happened. This ‘jump’ from morbid book club to \nactual murder came so quickly. This time last week I was finishing up a memoir \nby a retired FBI profiler, getting ready for Murder Club the next evening; now \n\nI’m here, trying to explain things to you in case the others get to me. Probably \nputting you in danger as well, to be honest, so… sorry about that. \nThat was the meeting where everything went wrong. It was at my flat – I \ntechnically only have a room, with the rest of the place shared between a \nrotating cast of whatever international students and burnouts my landlord \nrents to. But that night I had the flat mercifully to myself. I opened the \nwindows to let out the smell of smoke, turned on a small space heater to help \nwith the chill, and laid out a couple of bottles of wine that I bought special. \nJamie turned up first, as usual. He has an obvious crush on me, but he’s also \nabout ten years older that I am – was ten years older – and I just wasn’t into \nhim. Still, he was nice enough company, and we usually chat until the others \narrived. Ananya and Evelyn were next, and then Debbie. Andrew was late, but \nit was because he’d been whiskey shopping, which he explained was \napparently a thing, and he was in a sharing mood, so we managed to forgive \nhim. We all had our little pre-club catch-up, talking about life and work and the \nstate of the world, and we were just about to dive into the main discussion, \nwhen there was another knock at the door. \n[There’s a knock at the door.] \nBASIRA \nAh. \n[Door opens] \nOh, hiya Daisy! \nDAISY \n\nCome on. \nBASIRA \nUm, I’m kind of in the middle of something. \nDAISY \nWell, finish up. Sims is back. Wants to talk to everyone. \nBASIRA \nWhat? Since when? \nDAISY \n(Impatient) His flight got in a few hours ago. \nBASIRA \nAnd he called you? \nDAISY \nNo. Elias sent me to pick him up. Didn’t want him grabbed again. \nBASIRA \nAgain? \nDAISY \nYou coming? \nBASIRA \nWell, not yet. I’ve got to finish here first. You go on ahead. \n\n… \nDaisy? \nDAISY \nFine. \n[Door closes] \nBASIRA \nOkay, where was I? \nRight, okay, statement continues. \nBASIRA (STATEMENT) \n—we were just about to dive into the main discussion, when there was \nanother knock at the door. \nThere was a quick look of confusion that passed between us all, and my heart \nsank, assuming one of my flatmates had returned earlier than promised. I was \ndreading an awkward Lithuanian math student sitting in the corner with a glass \nof orange juice, staring at us as we self-consciously talked about… \ndecomposition rates and timelines. But those worries vanished as soon as \nJamie opened the door. The person who stood on the other side of it was \ndefinitely not one of my flatmates. \nThe first thing I noticed was the height. They were well over six foot, and the \ntop of their head disappeared above the door. The second thing was the mask, \npure white polystyrene, and cut into the rough shape of some kind of demon \nor wolf. The third thing I noticed was the knife.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 1, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 3471}}
