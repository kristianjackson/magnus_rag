The Magnus Archives. Episode one hundred and ninety-\nnine: \"Seeing it Through.\" \n[Theme finishes] \n[Tape clicks on] \n[The ambient sound of Leitner’s room in the tunnels, where \nMelanie’s comfy armchair is] \n[Melanie fidgets with her folded cane] \nMELANIE \nSo… \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 199 – Seeing it Through \n2 \nARCHIVIST \nYeah. \n(Beat) \nMARTIN \nAnyone want another cup of tea? \n[A chair scrapes as Martin rises] \nMARTIN (CONT’D) \nWell, heh, I say ‘tea’, it’s har— \nGEORGIE \nWe can’t keep putting it off. We need to talk about this. About what we’re \ngoing to do. \n[Martin sits again] \nMARTIN \nYou mean what John’s going to do. \nBASIRA \nNo. If we’re doing this, it’s gonna take all of us. \nMELANIE \nYou say “If”? It’s basically our only option, right? \nARCHIVIST \nNo, it’s not. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 199 – Seeing it Through \n3 \nMELANIE \nSo, we’re seriously holding up ‘let John become God’ as a legitimate choice \nhere? \nBASIRA \nCan’t just dismiss it. \n(Exasperated exhales) \nMARTIN \nYes, we can. \nMELANIE \nSeconded! \nMARTIN \n(Pleased) Thank you. \nGEORGIE \nWe still have to discuss it. \nLet’s try to lay this out properly. What are our actual options here? As far as I \ncan see there are three. \nMELANIE \nOkay. \nGEORGIE \nOne. We follow Annabelle’s plan. We destroy the Panopticon, kill Elias— \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 199 – Seeing it Through \n4 \nARCHIVIST \nJonah— \nGEORGIE \nWhatever. \nARCHIVIST \n—Magnus. \nGEORGIE \nWe kill him, and release the Fears into... how many other realities? \nBASIRA \nShe said thousands but, I don’t think she actually knows. \nGEORGIE \nJohn? \nARCHIVIST \nNot something I can see, I’m afraid. \nGEORGIE \nBut is it all other realities or just some of them? \n[The Archivist takes a step] \nARCHIVIST \nDoes it matter? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 199 – Seeing it Through \n5 \nMARTIN \nI mean, maybe? If there are infinite worlds out there then “thousands” isn’t \neven a drop in the bucket, cosmically speaking. \nMELANIE \n“Cosmically speaking”? \nMARTIN \nYou know what I mean. \n(Melanie sighs) \nBASIRA \nStill more than one, though, isn’t it? Which is what we’re discussing. \nGEORGIE \nSo again, option one is to kill Jonah Magnus— \nMELANIE \nMm-hmm. \nGEORGIE \n—and release the Fears. Save the world, but doom other realities to the Fears. \n[Melanie’s armchair creaks] \nMELANIE \nWe don’t know they’ll be doomed. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 199 – Seeing it Through \n6 \nGEORGIE \nSpread the fears to other realities. \nOption two is John takes over from Magnus. Keeps the Powers contained here \nwith us, and tries his best to make the place a little more... tolerable, until the \nend. \nMARTIN \nAnd we lose him. \nARCHIVIST \nMartin... \nMARTIN \nNo, John, I’m sorry, but if one world still matters in an infinite spread of \ndimensions then one person does too. \nMELANIE \nI-I think the issue is he matters a bit too much. \n(Martin makes a frustrated noise) \nMARTIN \nThe point is you don’t have a responsibility to sacrifice yourself just to make \neveryone else’s lives a bit easier. \nARCHIVIST \nI’ve already made them a hell of a lot harder! \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 199 – Seeing it Through \n7 \nMELANIE \nHmmm. \nMARTIN \n(Sharply) Then we should all sacrifice ourselves, because everyone in this room \nhas some responsibility for it. \nMELANIE \nHey! Georgie didn’t do anything! \nGEORGIE \nNo, Melanie, I, I didn’t. \nMELANIE \n(Softly) Yeah. \nGEORGIE \nAnd maybe I should have. I kept out of it, even when I got a pretty good idea of \nwhat was going on towards the end. But… (sighing) I should have known \nbetter. Hiding never helps. \nMELANIE \nIt keeps you alive. \nGEORGIE \nFor a while! But… we couldn’t actually do anything, could we? Couldn’t save \nanyone.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 0, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 4109}}
