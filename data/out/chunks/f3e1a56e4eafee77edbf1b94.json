Her father’s father’s father’s father’s father \nbuilt the maypole, carved from a jackalberry tree and painted in the colours of \nthe village. This place is her home and her right and her duty, and woe to any \nfungus-riddled outsider who might believe it otherwise. For no one would \nspeak up if Jillian Smith were to mark you infected or declare you foreign. No \none would lift a finger as they dragged you to the green. Her gloves are purest \nwhite and never sullied, and they hide a cerulean mould that covers every inch \nof her, through skin, muscle, and organ, though she has no idea it runs so \ndeep. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 164 – The Sick Village \n6 \nBy night, she sits in the quiet darkness of her perfect cottage, peeling herself \nwith a straight razor, layer by layer, desperate to reach the pure flesh she is so \nsure must still be in there, somewhere. Her living room is the same suffocation \nblue as the rest of her, every surface piled high with her own discarded bloody \nskin, and she has no terror deeper than the thought she might be discovered. \nAs she pulls spongy strips free one agonizing fibre at a time, she stares from \nher window at the house of her neighbour, Mrs Kim. Mrs Kim is not on the \nvillage council. Mrs Kim keeps to herself. And Jillian Smith is certain that Mrs \nKim is not infected, and hates her for it. \nWhat Mrs Kim is, is scared. Scared of her neighbours, scared of her friends, \nscared of the moment when someone will smell the spreading patch of \ndarkness on her back, and decide she is infected, or remember she has only \nbeen in the village since her grandfather’s day, and judge her to be an outsider. \nShould she accuse someone else? Send them to the village green? Perhaps she \nmight petition to join the council, though that would invite their attention as \nmuch as anything might. Even through the masks, Mrs Kim knows the looks \nshe gets in the pub. But what can she do? When she hears the shouts outside \nand sees the smoke pouring from the thatch roof, she knows it is too late. \nThey drag her to the maypole, their masks hiding the tears of terror and angry \nshame, and lash her there with those strips of cloth that never seem to burn. \nMrs Kim does not fight, though she screams and screams and screams as all \nher fears are realized. Jillian Smith tries to smile as she watches her neighbour \nburn, but the fungus is too thick around her lips, and her face no longer moves. \nAs the flames consume the last of Mrs Kim in thick and acrid smoke, the mould \nreaches the bones of Jillian Smith, and she blooms. In a moment she is swollen, \nbloated, bursting into a cloud of violet spores that envelop the green and those \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 164 – The Sick Village \n7 \nwho dwell there, embracing them in a rot that long since seeped into the soil \nof this blighted land. \n[The sounds of buzzing insects and squirming slowly fade back; the \ninitial English park sounds are easily heard again] \n(The Archivist breaths deeply) \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \n(Quietly) Okay. End recording. \n[Tape clicks off] \n[Tape clicks on] \n[Wind swirls; the distant sound of the village] \n[Martin and the Archivist stand on a gritty surface] \nARCHIVIST \nWe’re fine. \nMARTIN \nA-Are we? I mean, that place is- (sputters) I don’t, I don’t feel fine, okay, and \nyou were there a long time doing your, y-your guidebook, which, you know, I \nget it, but that place is— I-it’s infectious, and, I don’t— \nARCHIVIST \nWe’re not infected, Martin; that place, it… it isn’t for us. \nMARTIN \nA, alright but, but how do you know? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 164 – The Sick Village \n8 \nARCHIVIST \nI just… Do. I just know it. \n(Beat) \nMARTIN \nYou’ve been knowing a lot, lately. \nARCHIVIST \nYes. \nMARTIN \nA lot more than you used to. \nARCHIVIST \nYe..Yeah. \nAnd it, and it feels more… deliberate. Like I have more control now. \nMARTIN \nOkay. \nSo… How much can you see? What else do you know? \nARCHIVIST \nUhh... (surprise) Maybe everything. \nMARTIN \nWhat do you mean, ‘everything’?", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 2, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 4104}}
