I wept for my beautiful, stupid Benjamin \nand I wept for my own life, now most certainly lost to the cold and snow. And \nto hunger. It was as this last thought passed unbidden through my mind that I \nheard it. Very faint, calling softly, was the sound of Benjamin’s voice. I crawled \nover to him, for a second overjoyed that he might be alive, but as soon as I \ntouched his ice-cold skin, already beginning to turn blue, I knew that it could \nnot be so. Despite this, his head began to turn towards me and his frozen eyes \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 058 – Trail Rations \n \n12 \n \nopened. His lips parted above the gaping red slash across his throat and he \nspoke. \n“Eat me,” he said. \nI leapt back, shaking my head, praying the Lord to rid me of these terrible \nvisions, but his voice came again, clearer and louder this time, begging me \nagain to eat him. He told me how good he would taste, better than any salted \npork. I could cook him over the fire, he said, and the cold would keep him fresh \nfor as long as I needed. I yelled at him, screamed at him to be quiet, for \nwhatever devil had taken up inside to go back to hell, but it made no \ndifference. Still he pleaded to be eaten. \nIt has been five days now and Benjamin still entreats me. He taunts and curses \nme by turns, calls me a coward who would rather die than be part of \nsomething greater than myself. The entrance to the cave is all but blocked with \nsnow and, even if I were to dig my way out, there is nowhere for me to go. I \ndon’t even know where whatever’s left of the wagon would be. I think I might \ntry though, now I have finished this account of the events that led up to my \nfate. \nI hope whoever finds this does not judge us too harshly. We were simply \nseeking a better life. I leave this here, in the oilskins of Eustace Wick, in the \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 058 – Trail Rations \n \n13 \n \nhopes it may be protected from the depredations of winter. As for myself, I will \ntry to dig my way out and get as far as I can. I will not survive, but I hope the \nLord understands it is not suicide, it is simply that I can no longer stand to be \ntrapped here, where the corpse of my husband begs me to make it meat. \nARCHIVIST \nStatement ends. \nCertainly, a grotesque tale, but I don’t have access to the sort of information \nrequired to verify any of the details provided by the unnamed Mrs Carlisle. \nThere is no record of any Eustace Wick that I could find. There is a Benjamin \nCarlisle mentioned in a 1838 census of Burke County, North Carolina, but that’s \nabout it. The prayer apparently spoken by Mr Wick is a perversion of the old \nLutheran grace, “Come, Lord Jesus, be our guest and let thy gifts to us be \nblessed.” \nThere was a noted Lutheran preacher by the name of Horatio Wick that is \nmentioned briefly in several histories of Massachusetts as rather violently \nfalling out with his colleagues in the church over the Sacrament of the \nEucharist, but he apparently drowned in 1832. What interests me most is how \nthis unsigned letter, if it is to be believed, made its way from an icebound cave \nin Wyoming or Idaho, all the way to the personal collection of Jonah Magnus. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 058 – Trail Rations \n \n14 \n \n \nEnd recording. \n[Tape clicks off.] \nTIM (DISTANT) \nLook, I’ve tried talking to Elias about it.
