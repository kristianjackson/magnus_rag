Angus had been too keen to learn, too ambitious \nin his academic legacy. He had had grand plans to revise Smirke's Fourteen, \nand, in trying to doing so, burned through his resources, his luck, and \nultimately all but one of his assistants. When Gertrude was appointed to the \nrole, there was a single survivor left in the Archives: A woman by the name of \nFiona Law. \nFiona was the most fascinating combination of curiosity and cowardice, \npushing forward and forward into the unknown until the very first moment of \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 167 – Curiosity \n11 \nthreat crystallized, and then she was away. Of course, retreat is not always \npossible in such a line of business, and when that proved to be the case, there \nwas a single trait which Fiona possessed that saw her surviving encounters \nwhich had killed far braver souls than her. Because when she was pushed to \nthe very limits of her terror, Fiona Law would faint. \nAnd while there are those things in the dark that would kill you as you slept, \nmost get no real delight from it, unless you are awake enough to know what is \nhappening. And so, through cowardice and unconsciousness, Fiona had \nsurvived an entire generation of Archivist. And even stranger, when Angus \nStacey died and she had the chance to walk away, she decided to remain. She \nhad never got deep enough into the mysteries that plagued her to slake that \nburning curiosity. And she never would. \nAlongside this inherited survivor, Gertrude would add two more assistants, Eric \nDelano and Emma Harvey. They were young, like her, keen to delve deeper \ninto those strange secrets that back then were spoken of more openly. To \nthem, Fiona seemed something of a joke, a middle-aged chatterbox who told \nstories of the Blitz and jumped at the long shadows in the corners of the \nArchives. \nEmma in particular was Gertrude's confidant, the one whose knowledge and \ninstincts she trusted, and the only other member of the Institute who ever \nknew of the strange bond between Gertrude and Agnes Montague. \nBut Emma had a sickness. As much as she might have despised the aging Fiona, \nit was the same one that plagued her: Curiosity. That desperate, grasping need \nto know. Emma, however, was circumspect enough to recognize the danger of \nsuch inclinations in a place like the Archives, and after those initial few years, \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 167 – Curiosity \n12 \nsettled on a question. The first question to which she would apply her methods \nof experimentation: Why wasn't Fiona dead yet? \nThe experiments were simple enough. When a statement was close enough \nand real enough that finding its source seemed a possibility, Emma would \nvolunteer herself and Fiona to investigate it. Eric had always been a \nhomebody, and had no problem being left out of such expeditions, while \nGertrude had far better things to do than worry about the comings and goings \nof her helpers, and so let her trusted Emma arrange things as she pleased. \nOnce out near danger, Fiona would always find herself ever-so-slightly ahead, \nalways seeming to be inexplicably the first through the door. And more often \nthan not it would close behind her. By the end, the poor woman genuinely \nbelieved spontaneously locking doors were a tell-tale sign of the supernatural. \nEmma would do her best to observe from safety, making notes, only retrieving \nthe often unconscious Fiona when the danger passed. She watched as her poor \nguinea pig stumbled through a maze of whispering grubs. She timed the \nintervals at which Fiona emerged from a hungry fog, and recorded her barely \nescaping the sandman who came to take her eyes. Poor Fiona never suspected \na thing. \nDecades this went on, until Fiona was old and tired. There was less chaos back \nthen. Gertrude's war was still only kindling and years might go by without \nanything terrible brushing against the Institute. \nBut at last, they found a coffin. And it was not a place that could be escaped by \nfleeing or by fainting. When Emma came to tell Gertrude what had happened, \nshe found the first of the cobwebs in her hair, the ones she would wash from it \nevery morning for the rest of her life. And Gertrude mourned the first of many \nlosses, and did not suspect the truth.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 2, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 4416}}
