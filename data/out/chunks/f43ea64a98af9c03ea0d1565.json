My head is too heavy to give much \nthought to a clock. \nI am running through the city. The alleyways are narrow and winding and do \nnot turn all the directions that they should. The smell chokes me and my body \nis heavy as stone. I lean against a wall and, for a second, I am unsure if I will \never be able to stand myself up again. I stagger through another street then I \nstop. I lie down on the tarmac and it is warm and soft under me. I feel sleep \nbegin to overtake me, but I am wrong. It is dawn, and all that comes over me is \nfaint and sickly sunlight. I can hear his laugh again, and my mouth tastes like \nburnt coffee. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG074 – Fatigue \n7 \n \nI do not know why I am here. I know this place and what you want, but I have \nno proof to give you. I have nothing that cannot be waved away as a bad \ndream. By you, at least. I cannot wave, for my arms are too heavy and my \nhands are busy drawing those strange, familiar curves. What do you want? To \nfind a child’s tooth and hold it up triumphant, a talisman to conjure those \nthings that you should fear. \nTo photograph and analyse a billboard that has never once advertised coffee. \nTo talk to a person who is not a person and whose strange laugh you should be \nfleeing? I am here, and I give you my words. \nThey are all I have, and all you want, and perhaps when I am free of them then \nI will be allowed to sleep. \nI am standing before the billboard. It is night, though a nasty ray of daylight \nmakes it glow a dying pink. \nThe roundabout is empty and will never see a car again. It just goes around and \naround and around with no way on and no end to be had. The woman is baring \nher teeth in a triumphant snarl, her blouse now stained with the same rust that \nlaces through the bars that support her. Her eyes slough off her face, revealing \nthe twisted shapes of whatever the poster is that sits behind her. The steam \nthat rises from the coffee is the same. Always the same, always undisturbed, \ncurling in on itself. The words that stand stark above it: “Sleep no more”. I walk \ntoward the billboard, and my sobs are drowned out by the screaming of rusted \nstruts as they bend. The scream of the metal, buckling under the fatigue, the \nscream of the woman as she bears down upon me. It collapses on top of me, \nand I collapse with it. \nARCHIVIST \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG074 – Fatigue \n8 \n \nStatement ends. \nErm... a difficult statement. I am forced to agree with Ms. Halligan regarding \nhow verifiable what she says is. There’s no way to confirm it isn’t a series of \nbad dreams. It sounds like a series of bad dreams. \nA cry for help from a woman with a very severe problem. There are no details \nto follow up, save for Ms. Halligan herself, who passed away from a heart \nattack less than a month after giving this statement. \nShe was 29. \nThis time last year I would have dismissed her as a kook, wasting our time. But \na year changes a lot, and I now recognise the description of a tall man with \ncurly blond hair and a unnerving laugh all too well. \nMichael, did you drive her to this? Another victim of your warped games? Or \nwere you simply drawn like a vulture? Or maybe a shark sensing blood. What \ndo you want from your victims? \nI’m rather glad I don’t really drink coffee. \nEnd recording. \n[Tape clicks off. Tape clicks on.] \nSupplemental. \nI know who’s living in the tunnels. Well, that’s not exactly true. I don’t know \ntheir identity, but I’ve seen them. Shortly after Basira came to see me, I \ndecided not to request her help with the tunnels. It has become clear she has \nher own concerns to be dealing with, and I am becoming less and less \nconvinced that further police involvement won’t result in more issues down", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 3, "chunk_count": 5, "chars": 3794}}
