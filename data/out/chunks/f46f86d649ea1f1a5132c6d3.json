And \nall day, that intense, unshakeable feeling that she was being watched. \nSo when she turned and saw them standing there, so official in their vests and \nhelmets, what else was she to think? Ah, thank goodness, it flitted through her \nmind as Tina felt herself relax, whatever it is, someone is taking care of it. \nBecause that’s what they were for, to take care of these problems, to shuffle \npeople away for their own protection, and keep the world working as it should \nbe. She smiled, even as the shadowed figure did not remove his hand from her \nshoulder. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 185 – Locked In \n \n4 \n“Hello, officer. How can I help?” \n“I’m afraid you’re going to have to come with us,” they had said, as the sky \nabove them began to change. \nAnd then she was here. Tina didn’t remember the journey, not properly. There \nwas an image of the back seat of a car, bruised face pressed against metal \ngrating, wrists pinched so tight by metal she could feel every beat of her pulse. \nOr was it the back of a van, deep rumblings from the wheel well beneath her \nseat, vision obscured by a black bag that smelled of other people’s despair? \nHad she been forced to listen to a sanctimonious lecture on choices, on right \nand wrong and other luxuries? Or sharp-edged jokes at her expense in a \nlanguage she didn’t quite understand, which turned to shouts and blows when \nshe risked a movement. It didn’t matter, it wasn’t her memory. She was just \nhere. \nThe room in which Tina found herself was barren: a metal bench encrusted \nwith something black and flaky, and a bucket in the corner. That was it. It was \nobviously a mistake, some miscommunication somewhere, or a case of \nmistaken identity. These things were unfortunate, but sometimes they \nhappened. One of the people in charge would no doubt realise and sort it all \nout. She smothered the kernel of dread that was lurking in her chest. She just \nneeded to be patient. \n[The bench creaks] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nThe bench was uncomfortable to sit on, and she began to shiver from the cold. \nHad she ever been this cold before? Outside, of course, in the deepest winter, \nbundled up and pushing through to a heated home. But sat inside, with \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 185 – Locked In \n \n5 \nnowhere to go, nothing to change or wrap up in, just a thin grey jumpsuit, \nunable to do anything but sit there and shiver. That was a sort of cold that was \nalien to her. \n[Sounds of standing, then slow pacing] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nShe stood, trying to push down her physical discomfort and worry with \nmovement. The cell was small and cramped, and Tina kept hitting her shin on \nthe bench. She paused, casting an eye over the rough concrete wall \nsurrounding her, covered in deep grooves and... scratch marks. She turned \naway quickly, and saw the window above her. Had there been a window when \nshe had first come here? When had that been? It had no glass, just thick iron \nbars, but if she stood on tiptoe and really strained, she could just about see out \nof it. \n[She moves to the window; faint sounds of children playing, a bird, \nand passing cars] \nWhen she saw the world beyond her walls, her heart sank. The world seemed \nbright and normal. The sun was high and shining, though none of it passed \nthough the bars, and if she tried to reach through, the light seemed to shrink \nfrom her skin. Cars passed by on the road. Somewhere, a bird was singing. The \nworld didn’t miss her, didn’t know or care about what was happening beyond \nthese walls. \nA child passed by, a girl with plaited blonde hair and a bright orange bicycle. \nTina called quietly, suddenly afraid of who might be listening on the other side \nof her cell door. The child’s eyes met hers, the first moment of human \nconnection that she had really felt since she’d arrived… but hadn’t she only just", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 1, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 3960}}
