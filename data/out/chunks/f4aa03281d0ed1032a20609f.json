Huh, what are you? \n[Hissing static ends] \nMARTIN (CONT'D) \nHuh. Didn't even know I had a tape recorder. Do you still work, or… \n[Tape recorder handling] \nMARTIN (CONT'D) \nHm, yeah, seems like you're running all right. \nHey, I should do some poetry! You could give it a little, little bit of that funky \nlo-fi goodness! All the cool poets love a bit of tape hiss, right? Maybe find \nsomewhere different to sit, though. \n[Chair scrapes on the floorboards] \nMARTIN (CONT'D) \nHate these chairs. Don't even know where I got them. Did I tell you I've been \nwriting poetry? N-nothing much really, just fragments, thoughts. Haven't \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 170 – Recollection \n13 \nwritten anything like it since I was a teenager but, my new job is a lot, and, I \ndon't know. Something about that place, it just, it makes me feel weird? Th-the \nsort of weird you just have to get out somehow. Maybe I, Maybe I should do \nsome open mics, or something. I dunno. Just for me, really, I think. Oh! You-\nyou want to hear some? Heh. \nUh, yeah! Yeah, okay, sure; well, I can… no. No, wait, no they— Hm, they're \ngone, that's weird. I thought— I, I can feel them, but the words, they just… just \nwash away. Hm. I, I m— I suppose that's quite poetic actually, isn’t it, but… \nthere’s… nothing else there. \nI don't like this place. It-It's so cold and, and the logs in the fireplace are damp \nfrom the mist. I don't know how I'd even light them, and they-they smell really \nbad, like, like wet dirt. Makes me think of… hm. \nWhen I was nine, my grandad died. Did I tell you that? I went to the funeral, \nand the coffin was so (small laugh) shiny. It was already sealed. But on top \nthere was a photo of a young man. Someone who looked almost like my \ngrandad, but, it-it wasn't him. It wasn't... finished? Not yet. No, and, and I \nsuddenly began to panic, because I-I was trying to remember what he looked \nlike, his, his face, but I couldn't do it. And I knew I'd never see him again. He \nloved me and I couldn't even remember his face! It was, it was a horrid, drizzly \nmorning, that day, and they put him the ground and he, he smelled like earth. \nCold, damp soil. \n[Chair creaks] \nMARTIN (CONT'D) \nWhat was I saying? Ah, s-sorry… (exhales) \n[Chair scraping forward as he adjusts how he sits] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 170 – Recollection \n14 \nMARTIN (CONT'D) \nIt's just this chair, it's so hard to concentrate when you're uncomfortable, isn't \nit? (small sigh) \n[Chair creaks] \n[Hissing static starts] \nMARTIN (CONT'D) \nNow, I think— Hey, hang on. Where did you come from? Tape recorder. Heh, \nwhat, you want me to give you a statement, I— \n[The static gains more volume] \nMARTIN (CONT'D) \n(Flat) But why. The Eye has won. It can already see everything; it wouldn't \nneed a, w— wouldn't need a… \n[Hissing static ends] \nMARTIN (CONT'D) \n(Stumbling) Huh-w-huh, well, it's just, nice to talk to someone, I guess. No one \nreal ever really listens to me anyway. Oh, they, they nod and respond and say \n‘No, Martin,’ or ‘Not now, Martin,’ or ‘Leave it, Martin’ but, funny thing is, \n(false bright) I-I didn't ask them to do anything! I just, just wanted to see if \nthey needed a hand, heh. Is that me? Is-is that me? Martin? Martin. Maartin. \nMartin. Doesn't sound right. But who else would I be? Hm, whoever owns this \nhouse, I guess. It certainly doesn't seem like the sort of place that someone \ncalled Martin would live. Martin. It feels like a small name. One that wants to \nbe warm and happy. Not like here.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 4, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 3571}}
