A lot of strange happenings and \nimplicit weirdness, but nothing that can be isolated as a ‘supernatural event’. \nThere’s also the fact that even a casual search of port authority records shows \nthe Tundra is a currently active cargo ship operating for Solus Shipping PLC, a \ncompany founded and majority owned by Nathaniel Lukas. In addition to such \nbusiness ventures, the Lukas family also provides funding to several academic \nand research organisations, including the Magnus Institute. Much as I want to \ndig further into this, especially given certain parallels with case 0161301, Elias \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG033 – Boatswain’s Call \n14 \n \ngets very twitchy when we look into anything that might conceivably have \nfunding repercussions. \nIt doesn't look like I’m going to be able to do any further investigations into \nthis. Even though the official crew manifest for the Tundra has remained the \nsame for the last ten years. Even though I can’t find any record of actual cargo \nbeing loaded or unloaded into it from any UK port. Even though Sean Kelly \ndisappeared from the port of Felixstowe in October 2010, and his body washed \nup on the coast of Morocco in April 2011, six months later. According to the \ncoroner, it had only been in the water for five days. Maybe I’ll mention it to \nElias.
