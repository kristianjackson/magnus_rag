I wanted your opinion on an encounter I’ve had described to \nme, and given your recent dealing with Viscera, I would very much value your \ninput. \nGood job on that, by the way. I’m sure the gnostic temple was a great loss \nculturally speaking, but I can’t help but admire your directness when it comes \nto this sort of thing. I often find myself locked in a sense of esoteric paralysis \non how to proceed. \nStill. God grant me clarity to act when I need it. \nAnyway, I was following up on a young man who had apparently had a nasty \nexperience whilst exploring the ruins of the Bright Lake amusement park in \nColorado. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 156 – Reflection \nYou will forgive me if I withhold his name, as I have all the verification I need to \nbe sure he’s telling the truth, and I find it hard to believe any follow up you \nwould be interested in doing would be beneficial for him. He’s earned his \nanonymity. \nBright Lake lies to the north of White River National Forest, just off the I-70. It \nwas built in the sixties, around a large artificial lake that was apparently \nformed following a mining accident that had collapsed a significant portion of \nthe surrounding landscape. \nIt was, from what I can tell from a collection of photos taken in 1983, a largely \nunremarkable amusement park. A medium sized wooden roller coaster, a ferris \nwheel, a Hall of Mirrors, and a wide avenue of games and carnival booths, as \nwell as a fleet of paddle boats that allowed you to go out into the lake that \ngave the place its name. \nBy the nineties, it was struggling. By the turn of the millennium, it was out of \nbusiness, closing its gates for the last time in October 1999. \nFrom what I understand, there have been several plans to rebuild it or \nrepurpose the land in the decades since, but none have amounted to more \nthan surveyors pocketing fees and many slabs of planning documentation \ntucked away in filing cabinets. \nIt’s a little too out-of-the-way to be a common destination for teenage \ndelinquency, but has become, I’m told, quite popular with what can be \ndescribed as ’rural urban exploration groups.’ \nApparently, the lack of, well, actual urban areas to explore means that \nlocations such as this become quite a draw for those in the area with an \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 156 – Reflection \ninterest in abandoned places. And of course, its rather forbidding appearance \nafter ten years of decay has led quite a few ghost hunters out that way, as well, \nthough I’m not aware of any specific tragedies or stories about it that would \ngive them much to go on. \nMy young friend was specifically intending to use it as the site of a party they \nwere planning to throw. Based on his description, I would have called it a \nrave... but when I said so, he looked at me like I didn’t understand what he was \ntalking about. \nIn any case, there was going to be a lot of dancing and movement, so he \ndecided to scout ahead in order to see how structurally sound the place still \nwas. \nHe was planning to mark out those buildings and areas that should be avoided, \nand which should be sufficiently stable to support a crowd of intoxicated party-\ngoers. \nI pressed him on how scary it had been, what fear he might have felt \napproaching it, but whilst he’d admit it was \"creepy as hell,\" that was \napparently the point, and he said he didn’t feel any apprehension when he got \nthere. \nI suspect his machismo is stopping him admitting it, but there wasn’t much I \ncould do to get him to open up. \nHe was very interested in the Hall of Mirrors. According to him, if it was still in \ngood shape, it would have been an amazing place to put on a light show, and \nhave his guests dance their way through the maze.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 1, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 3787}}
