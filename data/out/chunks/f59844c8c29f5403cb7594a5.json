How long does it take to describe scary mud? \n[There is a wave of howls and screams from below] \n(Martin breaths shakily) \nMARTIN (CONT'D) \nOh, oh, o,okay, okay, okay— sorry, sorry! Sorry. \n[The wave subsides, the distant screams remain] \n[There is a faint electronic vibrating sound turning on and off; \nMartin turns] \nMARTIN (CONT'D) \n(Under his breath) Oh, god— (normal) What now? \n[He walks towards the noise, which buzzes at regular intervals; he \nstops; there is muffled musical notes accompanying the buzzing] \nMARTIN (CONT'D) \nWhat, seriously? A spade? \nIs that not kind of, I don't know, insensitive? Given where you are? \n(He sighs) \nFine. Fine, fine. \n(He sighs) \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 166 – The Worms \n18 \n[He picks the spade up with a scraping sound and starts to dig, \nrevealing a mobile phone playing a distorted version of the ‘Gran \nVals’ aka the ‘Nokia tune’] \nMARTIN (CONT'D) \nFor god's sake. \n[He drops the spade, dusts his hands off, picks up the phone, and \naccepts the call with a little low button ‘boop’ noise] \nMARTIN (CONT'D) \nHello? \nANNABELLE CANE \n(Over the phone) Hello.

Maybe I can be of some… assistance. \nMARTIN \nYou can assist me by giving me the creepy-phone-thing arrest! \nANNABELLE \nHe's more powerful here than he's ever been, isn't he? And you're not sure \nwhat that means for you. \nMARTIN \nI'm hanging up now. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 166 – The Worms \n20 \nANNABELLE \nDoes he even need you at all? \nMARTIN \nBye! \n[He hangs up with another boop] \n(Martin sighs) \n[A howling comes from below] \nMARTIN (CONT’D) \nGah I know, right? \n[Tape clicks off] \n[The Magnus Archives Theme – Outro] \nJONATHAN SIMS \nThe Magnus Archives is a podcast distributed by Rusty Quill, and licensed \nunder a Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial ShareAlike 4.0 \nInternational Licence.
