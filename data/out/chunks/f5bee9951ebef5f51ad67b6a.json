That you’re not gonna sacrifice yourself at the first opportunity, just \nbecause you feel guilty about what happened. \n(Beat) \nARCHIVIST \nI promise. \nMARTIN \nGood. \nGod, I hate these conversations. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 191 – What We Lose \n \n23 \nARCHIVIST \nYup. \n(Sighing) Heavy stuff. \nMARTIN \nI miss small talk. \nARCHIVIST \nWe could talk about the weather for a bit i-if you like? \nMARTIN \nHa. Bit difficult underground. \nARCHIVIST \nTrue. In that case I might see if I can get a bit more sleep. Rest up a bit before \nah... you know. \nMARTIN \nSure. \nARCHIVIST \nWake me if they get back? \nMARTIN \nOf course. \n[Tape clicks off] \n[Tape clicks on] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 191 – What We Lose \n \n24 \n[Surveillance sounds of above ground London: distant helicopters \nand drones, with some closer camera iris sounds; every so often a \ndrone flies by at speed, not lingering in the location] \n[Distant footsteps, mobility cane taps and talking that gets closer as \nMelanie and Georgie walk] \nMELANIE \nI do wonder how healthy it is, going to see him like that. \nGEORGIE \nI know. But… it helps me. I think. \nMELANIE \nIt certainly sounded pretty nasty. \nGEORGIE \nWell, it didn’t look too much better. Uh, there’s a, a bench here, to your left. \nDo you mind? \n[Walking stops] \nMELANIE \nUnoccupied? \nGEORGIE \nFor now. Come on. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 191 – What We Lose \n \n25 \nMELANIE \nSure. \n[Cane tapping as Melanie locates the bench] \n[They sit, with Melanie folding her cane] \nGEORGIE \nIt always tickles me. Coming up here for privacy. \nMELANIE \nI’m sure I don’t know what you mean. Personally, I think a city full of snooping \ncameras and staring eyes really sets the mood. \nGEORGIE \nOf course you do. \n[Fabric rustles] \nMELANIE \nEverything’s a bit... shit. Isn’t it? \nGEORGIE \nNot everything. \nMELANIE \n…How did he look? \nGEORGIE \nHe’s happy, I think. Does that… Does that make him evil? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 191 – What We Lose \n \n26 \nMELANIE \nIt makes him a cat. \nGEORGIE \nAnd, I mean, sure it’s not a great look for Battersea, but watching it... It’s just \nthe gorier bits of a nature documentary on repeat. \nMELANIE \nThere’s nothing natural about this though. \nGEORGIE \nNo. \nMELANIE \n…We could still pull him out, y’know, like, like the others. \nGEORGIE \nNo. No. It… It hurts to see him like that, but he’s safer there. If we took him, \nwe’d just be putting him in danger. We might even be putting the others in \ndanger from him. \nMELANIE \nYou’re not still going on about that dream of a giant, murderous tunnel-cat are \nyou? \n(Georgie snorts) \nYou know you’re not actually a prophet, hon? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 191 – What We Lose \n \n27 \nGEORGIE \nSure… But, by this point, it wouldn’t be the most unlikely thing that’s \nhappened to us. \n(Melanie makes a sad agreement sound) \nAnd it’s not like the tunnels have got any safer with them hanging around. \nMELANIE \nIt just feels crap, you know? Doing nothing. \nGEORGIE \nWe’re surviving. And trying to help others do the same. That’s not nothing. \nMELANIE \nTrue. \n[Melanie squeezes her folded cane] \nMELANIE (CONT’D) \nEven if it feels like it sometimes. \n(Beat) \n(Georgie sighs) \nGEORGIE \nI still care about him, you know. But getting involved will only make things \nworse. \nMELANIE \nWe’d better still be talking about the Admiral. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 191 – What We Lose \n \n28 \nGEORGIE \nJohn’s… doing his best. \nMELANIE \nYes. Well, his “best” is us hiding from nightmares in a damp tunnel. \nGEORGIE \nIt’s not his fault. It’s… not like he wanted it to happen. \nMELANIE \nI know that, right! I know. I know, but the… the truth is, I just don’t like him. I \nnever have… and I’m sick of people acting like I should feel so super-\nsympathetic towards him, just because he’s had a rough time of it. I’ve had a \nrough time of it from the second I met him! We all have! And he doesn’t— \nGEORGIE \nOh, honey. I— \nMELANIE \nOkay. I can still hate him, even if I don’t, y’know, blame him but… \n(Melanie exhales frustratedly) \nGEORGIE \nYou know, you’re actually quite similar. \nMELANIE \nWell then at least I hate consistently.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 4, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 4136}}
