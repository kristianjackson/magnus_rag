Episode one hundred and thirteen. \nBreathing room. \n[Tape clicks on. The dialogue is muffled, as if the tape recorder is in a bag. \nThere’s the sound of a storage unit door opening.] \nARCHIVIST \nThere. \nMARTIN \nHuh. \nARCHIVIST \nWhat? \nMARTIN \nI just… I thought it would be less... I don’t know, crowded. \n\nARCHIVIST \nOh, you know Gertrude. If something's worth doing, it’s worth… looking \nthrough two dozen unmarked cardboard boxes for. \nMELANIE \nSo, what are we looking for? \nARCHIVIST \nI’m… still not exactly sure. I-It might be an old, taxidermied gorilla skin. Or… \nnot. Apparently it should be obvious. \nMELANIE \nRight. Then let’s get on with it. \n[There are noises as they start to search through the storage unit.] \nMARTIN \nSo, you actually met vampire Trevor then? \nARCHIVIST \nI mean, I, I met... quite a few people from the statements. You remember, er, \nDr Elliott’s statement? The anatomy students trying to pose as people, who \ndefinitely weren’t people? \nMARTIN \nOh… y-yeah. \nARCHIVIST \n\nWell, turns out one of them became a police officer. Or, pretended to. \nMARTIN \nUgh, ooh… Is that the one Trevor...? \nARCHIVIST \nYes. \nMARTIN \nAnd he… killed it? \nARCHIVIST \nUmm… That’s— I mean, it’s not as simple as... Found anything yet? \nMARTIN \nEr… er… Bunch of… eyeless paintings. \nMELANIE \n(Cheefully) Snap! Eyeless dolls. Oh, and just a lot of shredded newspapers. \nARCHIVIST \nSame. \nMARTIN \nMmm. Ooh! Ooh! There’s a book in this one. \nARCHIVIST \nDon’t… touch it! \n\nMARTIN \nOoh… Oh! Right, yes. \nARCHIVIST \nLet’s... not touch any books we don’t know. \nMARTIN \nRight. \nARCHIVIST \nStep back. \n[The sound of pages turning.] \nARCHIVIST \n(Sigh of relief) It’s just a notebook. I think… um… \n(Martin sighs.) \nMARTIN \nWhat’s in it? \nARCHIVIST \nNot sure, er… Names, locations, dates. I’ll, I’ll check properly later. Doesn’t look \nlike it’s to do with the Unknowing, I don’t think. \nRight. \n[They continue to search.] \n\nMARTIN \nSo… how was it? \nARCHIVIST \nAh? \nMARTIN \nAmerica? And China? I’ve never really actually done any, you know, travelling. \nMELANIE \nIt’s not all that. Sometimes you get shot by a ghost. \nARCHIVIST \nAnd refuse to give a statement about it. \nMELANIE \nYup! \nARCHIVIST \nIt was nice, Martin. \n(Pause) It was... weird. Paranoia is an odd combination with culture shock. \nReally rather disorientating. \nMARTIN \nI mean… it wasn’t actually paranoia, though, was it? Because, they were out to \nget you. \n\nARCHIVIST \nI suppose that they were. \nMELANIE \nWasn’t a great time back here, either. \nARCHIVIST \nOh, god, Melanie, of course. I’m… I’m sorry. If I’d known that Ivy Meadows \nwas— \nMELANIE \nWhat?! You’d have told me? Let me learn from one of your statements instead \nof from Elias? I don’t see that changing anything. \nARCHIVIST \nEven so, I… am... I’m sorry. \nMELANIE \nI don’t need your apology. Or your pity. \nARCHIVIST \nOf course. (Quieter) Of course. \nMartin’s plan is solid. I think. \nMARTIN \nI mean, they might just kill him. \n\nMELANIE \nGood. \nARCHIVIST \nI mean, maybe. But… I think they’re still our best chance. Even if we did \nmanage to blindside him, I-I don’t know how long we could… hold him. \nMARTIN \nAnd, in fairness, he’s happy enough to use the police against us. \nARCHIVIST \nQuite. And I’d rather not be staring down a kidnapping charge on top of \neverything— \nMELANIE \n(Urgently) Uh, John? \nARCHIVIST \nYes? \nMELANIE \nI… I think I found that gorilla skin you were talking about…. \nARCHIVIST \nPerfect! Er, now if we could just— \nMELANIE \n\nOr, I’m afraid… uh, what’s, what’s left of it. \nARCHIVIST \nOh. \nMELANIE \nYeah. \nARCHIVIST \nSo… she did destroy it. \nMELANIE \nApparently. \nARCHIVIST \nRight. \n[A box is opened.] \nSo if that’s… not what we’re looking for... \nMARTIN \nJ-J-John, John! \nARCHIVIST \nWhat? \nMARTIN \nI think I’ve found it! \n\nARCHIVIST \nW-Wh-What is it? \nMELANIE \n(Laughs) I think you’re gonna want to see this! \nARCHIVIST \nGood lord! Is… Is that...? \nMELANIE \nLooks like it. \nARCHIVIST \nWhere the hell did she get this? I— Martin, don’t touch it! \nMARTIN \nSorry! \nARCHIVIST \nIs it... stable? \nMELANIE \nHow should I know? I don’t even know what kind it is! \nARCHIVIST \nI mean, it looks like… C4? \nMELANIE", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 0, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 4349}}
