The Magnus Archives. Episode one hundred and ninety: \n\"Scavengers.\" \n[Theme finishes] \n[Tape clicks on] \n[A humming indoor sound; as individuals speak their voices reverb \nagainst concrete walls] \nCELIA \n(Anxious) I don’t like it. They’ve been gone too long. \nLAVERNE \nThey’re fine. Sometimes they take a while. It’s hardly the longest they’ve been \ngone, is it? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 190 – Scavengers \n \n2 \nCELIA \nHow would I know? It’s not like I have a watch, is it? \nLAVERNE \nThen how do you know what’s too long? \nCELIA \nHow do you know what isn’t? \nLAVERNE \nCelia… just trust them. “They walk this world above the nightmare. It will not \ntake them.” \nCELIA \nYeah, you’re, you’re right. Of course. You’re right. \n[Chair scrapes, Celia stands and starts pacing] \nLAVERNE \nBesides, you know that they sometimes go to a side tunnel for “private \ncontemplation”. I think it’s sweet. \nCELIA \n(Petulant) They can contemplate privately here... \nLAVERNE \nCan they? There’s not exactly many doors down here. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 190 – Scavengers \n \n3 \nCELIA \nNo, I guess… \nLAVERNE \nAnd the tunnels do have a tendency to echo... \nCELIA \nYes, alright, fine! Fine! \nExcuse me for caring. \nLAVERNE \nWe all care. \nCELIA \nYeah… well... \n[Celia nervously fiddles with supplies – bottles clink, paper rustles] \n[Celia’s voice starts to sound closer] \nCELIA (CONT’D) \nLaverne? \nLAVERNE \nMmm? \nCELIA \nHas anyone been messing with the supplies? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 190 – Scavengers \n \n4 \nLAVERNE \nDon’t think so. Why do you ask? \nCELIA \nThere’s a tape recorder here. \nLAVERNE \nOh. \n(Warily) Should there not be? \nCELIA \nI-I don’t know. I haven’t seen it before. \n[More plastic rustling] \nCELIA (CONT’D) \nIt’s running. \nLAVERNE \nHow odd. \nCELIA \nYeah, I don’t like th— \nHang on, listen. \n[Distant sounds of echoing tapping and footsteps; Celia runs to the \ndoor and opens it] \n(Relieved) Oh thank god. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 190 – Scavengers \n \n5 \nLAVERNE \nThat them? \nCELIA \nYeah. And they’re with a couple of new people! I don’t recognise them! \nLAVERNE \nWell, that explains it, doesn’t it? \n[Walking and tapping louder] \nCELIA \n(Whispered shout) Georgie! Melanie! Over here! \nARCHIVIST \n (Faint, amused) First name terms with the prophets? Bit disrespectful. \nGEORGIE \n(Faint) John. \nARCHIVIST \n(Closer) Sorry. \n[Sounds of a group entering the room] \nLAVERNE \nGlad to see you’re okay. We were getting worried. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 190 – Scavengers \n \n6 \nARCHIVIST \n(Quiet) After you. \nGEORGIE \n(Teasing) Oh, were you? Both of you? \nCELIA \n(Plaintive) I’m allowed to care! \n[Footsteps and small movements as folks settle themselves] \nGEORGIE \nWhere’re the others? \nLAVERNE \nI think Arun’s off writing. The rest are sleeping. \n[Someone sits on a wood chair] \nARCHIVIST \nYou can sleep here? \nMELANIE \nYou don’t have to, but it does pass the time. \n[Melanie folds her cane and settles into a squeaking armchair] \nMARTIN \nThis place is pretty nice. \n[Martin puts down backpack] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 190 – Scavengers \n \n7 \nMELANIE \nYeah, I reckon it used to be the hideout of, um, of you-know-who, uh, when he \nwas living down here. It had supplies and everything. \nCELIA \nSorry, we haven’t been introduced, you are...? \nGEORGIE \nOh, um, of course, sorry. This is— \nARCHIVIST \nJonathan. John. Sims. \nMARTIN \nUh, Martin. Hello! \nGEORGIE \nAnd this is Laverne. \nLAVERNE \nGood to meet you. \nGEORGIE \nAnd Celia. \nMARTIN \n(Puzzled) Celia? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 190 – Scavengers \n \n8 \nCELIA \nProbably. The, um... place I was trapped in, they took my name. I never got it \nback. But I like Celia, so… yeah! Celia it is. \nMARTIN \nUh… H-Hello... Celia. \nCELIA \nSo, where were you two then? \nARCHIVIST \nEr… Pardon? \nCELIA \nThey saved you, right? From one of the nightmares? So, what was it? \nARCHIVIST \nOh… \nLAVERNE \nCelia, don’t push. They can tell us when they’re ready. \n(Discomfited sounds from Martin) \nGEORGIE \nUh, no, they’re, they’re not um— \nWe didn’t rescue them.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 0, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 4415}}
