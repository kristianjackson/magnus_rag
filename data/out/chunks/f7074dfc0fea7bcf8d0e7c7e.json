On John’s insistence I recently changed the Archive’s fire suppression \nsystem to use carbon dioxide. Should have done it years ago, really… \nSASHA \n So why hasn’t it gone off? ELIAS Because there isn’t an actual fire. \nSASHA \n Right, right. Can we set it off manually? I think John’s got a lighter somewhere. ELIAS He’s not \nsmoking again, is he? Anyway, it shouldn’t be necessary. There is a manual release, a few floors \ndown. \nSASHA \n Wait. Wait. Will it hurt Martin or John? ELIAS Almost certainly. Er, I’m not a doctor, but I know \ndumping a lot of CO2 on people isn’t generally considered a good idea. I really don’t want to have to \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG039 – Infestation \n15 \n \nfind another Archivist so quickly after Gertrude, but from what you say… it might be a mercy. You \nknow the situation best, so…? \nSASHA \n Let’s go. [CLICK] [CLICK] [FIRE ALARM CAN BE HEARD… AS CAN SOUND OF BANGING ON WALL] \nMARTIN \n I thought that wall was meant to be solid?! \nJONATHAN SIMS \n So did I. We don’t have any sort of weapon, do we? \nMARTIN \n I mean… I mean, I suppose we could use… \nJONATHAN SIMS \n Don’t say the corkscrew! \nMARTIN \n Okay. \nJONATHAN SIMS \n How many of them are outside of the door? \nMARTIN \n I don’t know. I can’t see because the window is covered in worms. \nJONATHAN SIMS \n Right. Right. Damn. Well, Martin I guess this is— \n[SOUND OF PLASTERBOARD AND TILE BREAKING] \nTIM \nHi guys! \nMARTIN \n Tim! \nJONATHAN SIMS \n Tim?! What the hell? I thought... how did you...? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG039 – Infestation \n16 \n \nMARTIN \n You made it! TIM Funny story really. I ran into the office, worms everywhere, horrible death and \neverything, tripped and fell in some boxes and there were like 20 cans of gas in there. \nMARTIN \n Are, are you alright? You seem a bit... TIM Fine! Fine! Gas... bit light-headed. Not a lot of ventilation \nin the tunnels. Come on! \nJONATHAN SIMS \n In-Into the tunnels? \nTIM \nYeah! Actually, not that many worms in there anymore. I think they’ve mostly gone into the Archive. \nAlthough the ones down here are faster for some reason. And quieter. \nJONATHAN SIMS \n You’re not bitten, are you? TIM No, I don’t think so! Have a look! \nJONATHAN SIMS \n Yes, alright Tim, you look fine. Put them back on, please. \nMARTIN \n Can can you walk, John? \nJONATHAN SIMS \n No, I can limp. TIM Then let’s go! \nJONATHAN SIMS \n Martin, could you pass me the tape recorder? \nMARTIN \n Sure. I think it’s running out, though. \nJONATHAN SIMS \n Fine. I suppose I can turn it back on when we’re being eaten alive. \nTIM \nWhy do you have a second tape recorder, Martin? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG039 – Infestation \n17 \n \nMARTIN \n Oh, um… well, I’ve been using it to record myself. I write poetry and I think the tapes have a sort \nof… low-fi charm. \nJONATHAN SIMS \n … I see. \n[CLICK] \n[CLICK] \nSASHA \n(Echoing) Okay, John. I know you’ll want to know what’s been happening. If you’re still alive after \nthis. The worms are on the upper floor. Not as many as down in the Archive, but enough. \nI set the fire alarm off, so everyone’s evacuated except me and Elias. I didn’t see any signs of the fire \nbrigade, but I haven’t been near a window in a while. There was a... I guess you’d call it a… a wave of \nworms. I got cut off from Elias. I hope he made it to the fire system, but who knows. Maybe \neveryone’s dead already. \nI’ve had to retreat into Artefact Storage. That should tell you something about how bad it is out \nthere. God, I hate this place. \nDid I ever tell you I first joined the Institute as a practical researcher? I had to analyse and investigate \nall the stuff in here. Take notes after sleeping in the rusted chair, write in the memory book, all that \nsort of thing. I transferred after three months. Would’ve quit, but couldn’t afford to back then. \nNever understood why they keep this stuff secret. I mean, we’ve, we’ve enough here to send any \nsceptic packing, but it’s just locked away. I… I asked Elias about it once, but he just muttered \nsomething about funding and mission statements. He’s good at changing the subject, isn’t he? \nSorry. I’m rambling. No worms, though, so that’s good. \nOh, hey. I’ve found… I’ve found that table you were talking about. Don’t really see what all the fuss is \nabout. Just a… basic… optical illusion. Nothing special… just… just a… wait... \n(Panicked Whispering in to Tape Recorder) John! John, I think there’s someone here. Hello? I see \nyou. Show yourself. \n[AUDI", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 4, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 4500}}
