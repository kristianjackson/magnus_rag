I didn’t get the job. If I kick up a stink, I’ll just get \nblackballed. \nTIM \n(Resigned) Ah, yeah. \n(Beat) \n(Mischievous) What if we kill him? \nSASHA \n(Amused) What, Elias? \n[Stapling and paper noises pause] \nTIM \nNo. Big Boss Sims. Cut the brakes on his office chair; no one would ever know. \n(Sasha laughs) \nTIM (CONT’D) \nSwap in a poisoned tea bag, pin it on Martin— the perfect crime. \nSASHA \n(Still laughing) And how do you know that you won’t be the one that gets it? \nThat boy makes a lot of tea. \nTIM \nOh, it’s okay; I spent the last few years building up an immunity to iocane \npowder. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 162 – A Cosy Cabin \n19 \n(Sasha lets out an exaggerated groan at the reference) \n(Tim hehs) \n(Beat) \n[Stapling and paper noises resume] \nTIM (CONT’D) \nSo, what are you gonna do. \nSASHA \nI don’t know, really. Might just get another job. \nTIM \nWhat, seriously, just jump ship? \nSASHA \nYeah, I guess so. I mean, there’s not much out there at the moment, but I’ve \ngot a few alerts set up. \nTIM \nI can’t believe you’d just abandon our intense will-they, won’t-they storyline \nlike that. \nSASHA \nEeerm, I’m pretty sure we established it’s very much won’t they. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 162 – A Cosy Cabin \n20 \nTIM \nNo, no, no, no, see— we had the ill-advised hookup, the awkward aftermath, \nand the gradually rebuilt friendship, but— that’s all season two stuff. We’ve \ngot like five more seasons before we get the heartwarming epilogue that \nmakes it canon. \nSASHA \nI know it’s hard to hear, mate, but you’re not the love interest. \nI think you might be the character they drop after the pilot! \nTIM \nUh, wow. You are vicious today. \nSASHA \nSorry, Tim! I can’t hear you over all this stapling. \n(Beat) \nSASHA \n(Sigh) I guess it’s just- I don’t have anything keeping me here. You’ve got your \nbrother… \nTIM \n(Quiet) Yeah. \nSASHA \nSorry. And Martin can’t go anywhere that’ll look too hard at his CV. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 162 – A Cosy Cabin \n21 \nTIM \nWait. How do you know about that? \nSASHA \nIt’s all on the system. Our digital security is shocking, by the way. Besides, it’s \nnot even a good lie. \nTIM \nOkay, but seriously, you cannot let Martin know. He’ll think I told you, and I \nswore to keep schtum. \nSASHA \nHey, don’t worry. I just— I mean— I kinda just ended up here. And I like it— l, \nliked it. But if I’m bashing my head against the glass ceiling, it’s time to go. \nTIM \nWell. I’ll miss you. \nSASHA \n(Fond) Yeah. You will. \nTIM \nOh, for god’s sake. “Oh, Tim’s so hard to talk to, seriously, he won’t stop \nmaking jokes and references, not like Sasha.” (normal) They’ve got no idea. \nSASHA \nAnd they never will. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 162 – A Cosy Cabin \n22 \nTIM \nSeriously, though. Everyone thinks you’re just this reliable, down-to-earth \nnerd— \nSASHA \nAnd what makes you think they’re wrong? \nTIM \nSo what, actually I’m the one who doesn’t get to see the real you? \nSASHA \nNo such thing. \nTIM \nAs what? \nSASHA \nA- A real you. I don’t think so, at least. It’s all just masks. \nTIM \n(Amused) Alright, Stanislavski. \nSASHA \nYou know what I mean. \nTIM \nYou really believe that? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 162 – A Cosy Cabin \n23 \nSASHA \nKind of! I mean, who knows why we do what we do? \nTIM \nI do. \nSASHA \nNo. All you know is what your brain does to justify what you do. It’s no more \nreason than the face you put on for John. The only real you is the actions you \ntake. \nTIM \nHey, I’ll have you know I have a rich inner life. \nSASHA \nHow nice for you. But hurry up with your outer one; you’re falling behind, and \nI’m not saving you any staples. \nTIM \n(Laughing) Yeah, yeah. I still can’t believe Gertrude was allowed to let this \nplace get into such a state! \nSASHA \nMm. I just wanna know why. \nTIM \nWhat d’you mean why? You saw her, she’s like a hundred years old and more \ncardigan than woman. She just started to lose it. Sad, but it happens. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 162 – A Cosy Cabin \n24 \nSASHA \nYou never talked to her, did you? \nTIM \nWell, I mean, I must have at some point. \nSASHA \nHeh, you’d remember. \nTIM \nWhy? What was she like? \nSASHA \nStone. Cold. Bitch. \nTIM \nSasha! \nSASHA \nAnd sharper than you! No way this is accidental. \nTIM \nOh, yeah, this is all a big geriatric conspiracy. \n(Beat) \nTIM (CONT’D) \nWait, seriously?", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 3, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 4385}}
