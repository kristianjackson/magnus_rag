No-one would \neven notice, if I didn’t give you time to scream. \nARCHIVIST \nRight. R-right. So why don’t you? Does your ‘god’ not want you to? \nJUDE \nHard to say. When I look at you I feel that burning liquid pain, eager to flow out \nand purify your rotten carcass, but I feel that a lot. \nARCHIVIST \nOh. M-More or less than normal? \nJUDE \nHard to say when every nerve ending’s on fire. Hard to tell degrees. \nARCHIVIST \nThird degree, maybe? Oh! Sorry, sorry, it was a… I have a god too, right? \nJUDE \nIs that another joke? \nARCHIVIST \nN-No, I… I’m new to this. Everyone keeps calling me ‘Archivist”, like I’m special, \nand that… that I serve the Eye. Trying to kill me for it. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG089 – Twice as Bright \n6 \n \nJUDE \nYes. \nARCHIVIST \nS-So… I-It’s like… your ‘god’, right? \nJUDE \nOh please, your god is nothing! The Eye, Beholding, Ceaseless Watcher, \nwhatever you call it, that’s all it does, it watches and knows, sitting bulbous \nand comfortable in the ignorance of infinite knowledge. \nI serve a reckoning, a surging tide of destruction and pain. \nARCHIVIST \nThe Lightless Flame. \nJUDE \nThe Desolation. Blackened Earth. The destructive, agonising heat of burning \nflesh and land scoured of life. The light, the comfort of fire stripped from it, \nleaving nothing but the terror of its approach. When it triumphs, it will leave \nThe Eye a burned and shrivelled husk that sees nothing but its own agony. \nARCHIVIST \nI, er, I think I… I-I see. So if one… if one wants to watch everything, to know \neverything and the other wants to… destroy – \nJUDE \n(Laughs) You don’t even know what this is about, do you? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG089 – Twice as Bright \n7 \n \nARCHIVIST \nSo tell me! \nJUDE \nAn Archivist pleading for knowledge. That, oh, that is satisfying to see. \nARCHIVIST \nLook, if you’re just… You’re just about my only lead, and if you’re… Just kill me, \nalright? If it’s so easy? If you’re not going to tell me anything worth my time. \nJUDE \nNow you’re sounding like an Archivist. \nARCHIVIST \nHm. \nJUDE \nAnd now I’m obviously not going to kill you. \nARCHIVIST \nWhy not? \nJUDE \nConsider it a favour. \nARCHIVIST \nThank you. \nJUDE \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG089 – Twice as Bright \n8 \n \nNot for you. For Elias. \nARCHIVIST \nWait, but… I mean, if I serve Beholding or… He-He’s in a lot deeper than I am. I \nthink. \nJUDE \nThe rumour is he killed Gertrude Robinson. If so, I feel like I owe him. And he \nclearly wants you alive, so… \nARCHIVIST \nWhat, no? But she was the last Archivist, so, y-your… your god… Why? \nJUDE \nThe unfathomable contest of eternal forces is not the only reason I might want \nsomeone dead. \nARCHIVIST \nSo… so tell me the story of why you wanted Gertrude – AH – AAH! \n[There’s the sound of something burning] \nJUDE \nTry to compel me again, and I’ll burn it out your mouth. \nNow you’re scared. Now you’re getting it. There’s no safety in sitting on the \nsidelines watching. The audience is only safe when the story isn’t about them. \nARCHIVIST \nFine. Fine! Keep your damn secrets. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG089 – Twice as Bright \n9 \n \nJUDE \nNo. Maybe I do want to tell you a story. \nARCHIVIST \nWell, if it’s not about Gertrude or Gwydir…. And I can’t talk about A– right… \nThen what? \nJUDE \nI’m going to give you some advice. \nARCHIVIST \nFantastic. Well? \nJUDE \nAren’t you going to say your words? \nARCHIVIST \n(Sigh) Statement of Jude Perry, regarding… some advice. Recorded direct from \nsubject, April 24th, 2017. Statement begins. \nJUDE (STATEMENT) \nWell, if you smother a flame, it dies. The only way it grows and flourishes is if \nyou feed it. It’s about making sure you find enough fuel for it, and… not caring \nwhere it comes from. If you spend your time hiding and fretting about who you \nhurt, you’ll sputter, and you’ll die as surely as any candle. Don’t be afraid to \nburn. \nThe pain is sensational. You feel your flesh cooking, your nerves screaming out \nas they die exquisitely. Your whole body changes texture as you become that", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 1, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 4008}}
