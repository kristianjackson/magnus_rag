I was ready for a fight, but they just stood there, not \nmoving, staring at us. Everything about the situation felt wrong. I looked over \nat Zac and he seemed to be thinking the same thing. He looked over at the two \nmen in overalls and told them to take it out, then looked over to Tom, asking if \nhe had a key to the padlock. Reaching into his jacket, the man who called \nhimself Tom pulled out a large iron key and handed it to my partner. It didn’t \nlook like the other keys. I wanted to head back to the car and call in some \nback-up, but Zac was a senior officer and if he thought we should open it first, I \nwas going to back his play. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 061 – Hard Shoulder \n \n14 \n \nZac took the key and walked towards the coffin, which now lay on the wet \ntarmac, lit only by the headlights of our car. The moaning was louder now, \nalmost drowning out the sound of the hammering rain. Water had begun to \nflow off the wood, but everything else about it was still. As he got closer, I \ncould see the words ‘‘Do Not Open’’ scratched into the surface of the wood. It \ndidn’t look like my partner was paying them any attention though. He gently \nplaced the key into the lock, wincing slightly as he touched the metal, and \nturned it. \nThe chains snapped off like they were spring-loaded. They whipped around \nviolently and Zac jumped back, slipping and falling on his back. I brought my \nbaton up just in case the strangers made a move, but they were motionless. \nThe moaning had stopped. The only sound was the creaking of hinges, as the \nlid of the coffin began to move. It was slow, the gap appearing first as just a \ncrack, before finally opening completely. It was too dark to see what was inside \nat first, but when I shone my torch inside, I heard Zac gasp. I think I did as well. \nInside of that wooden coffin, there was a staircase. It went down, apparently \ninto the ground below, and seemed to go on as deep as I could see. They were \nsteep, carved out of what looked like solid stone, and the rock that made up \nthe walls didn’t match the wet tarmac around us, or the earth that would have \nbeen underneath it. It was completely impossible. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 061 – Hard Shoulder \n \n15 \n \nI tried to ask Tom or his companions about it. I yelled at them to explain what \nthe hell was going on, but they just stood there, staring at it. So I hit one of \nthem with my baton. It was one of the larger men in overalls; I’m not sure \nwhich one. It was like hitting solid wood, and the blow jarred my arm badly, \nmaking me drop the only weapon I had. Even then, he just stood there, staring \nat the casket. \nThere was the sound of movement from behind me. I turned to see Zac \nwalking into the coffin, his torch shining into the hollow below. He had already \ndisappeared up to his waist and there was this look on his face that I had never \nseen before: relaxed, like he was asleep. I shouted for him, started to run, but I \nfelt a huge hand grip my shoulder. I grabbed it with my good arm, tried to \nescape it, but the grip was too strong. The texture of the flesh was like hard \nrubber. All I could do was watch as my partner kept walking into the earth on \nstairs that couldn’t be there. After a few seconds, he was completely out of \nsight. \nI expected to hear something, shouting, a scream, something. But it was still \njust the rain. The lid closed very slowly, and then he was gone. Just a coffin \nsitting on the hard shoulder of the M6. The hand released my shoulder as the \ntwo men in overalls began to walk over and calmly wrap the chains back \naround it. I felt a sudden burst of anger and picked up my baton.
