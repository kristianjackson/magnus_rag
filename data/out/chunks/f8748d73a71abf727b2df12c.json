At least, that’s \nwhat it looked like, as she dared not touch them. Those that had fallen seemed \nto have fused with the street, and some that seemed to have been too close to \nnearby walls were embedded within them. Every single shrivelled, ashen face \nwas contorted in a scream of agony; every sharp and jutting jaw cracked and \ntwisted in an expression of horror, of understanding not just of their death, but \nthe end of everything they knew. It was clear that they had been this way for \nyears, if not decades. Bernadette says she was sure that nothing had moved in \nthat dead city for a hundred years. She was mistaken. \nI have never envied you your position, Gertrude. I have never coveted your \ngifts, as I know the terrible costs that come with them. But honestly, trying to \nget a description of these things, these “inheritors”, from Bernadette Delcour \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 134 – Time of Revelation \n \n7 \n \nmade me wish I could just pull the image from her lips like you would have \nbeen able to. In the end, she would say nothing of them except that, “There is \nnothing done in the history of humanity that deserves the things that come \nafter us.” She was more precise on her escape. Remembering Hillier’s words \nabout the door, she had just enough time to retreat back to the apartment and \nbarricade herself inside. Then she waited until the entrance changed again and \nshe could emerge back into the world she remembered. At least, that’s my \ninterpretation of events. She was rather agitated by this point in the account, \nso I believed it best to leave her to it. I may try to interview her again later, \nthough I have my suspicions she may find herself disappearing. She has that \nquality about her, I’m sure you know what I mean, of an unfinished meal, and I \ncan only hope that when the second course starts she can remember her way \nback to Garland Hillier’s apartment once more. But of course, the evidence \nsuggests that, in the end, even he wasn’t able to. \nNow I know what you’re going to say, Gertrude. Odd doors are a sign of the \nSpiral, empty worlds tend towards the Lonely, and eschatology is almost \nliterally the study of The End, but this is different. I feel it. This fear is new. This \nis a fear of Extinction. Of change. It used to be part of The End, perhaps, when \nthe end of humanity was to be the end of all things, but now the fear is not of \na rapture or a revelation, it is of catastrophic change. A change in our world \nthat will wipe out what it means to be us and leave something else in its place. \nMankind will warp the world so much it kills us all and leaves only a thousand \nyears of plastic behind. Technology will strip us of what it means to be human \nand leave us something alien and cold. We will press a button that in a \nmoment will destroy everything we have ever been. Animals are witnessing \nthe end of their entire species within a single generation. These are new fears, \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 134 – Time of Revelation \n \n8 \n \nGertrude, and a new power is rising to consume them. The Extinction. The \nTerrible Change. The Future Without Us. \nI know you don’t credit my theories, and I’m sure you’ll have plenty to say on \nthis one, but I’m going to need your help with this at some point, I’m sure of it. \nI don’t know how you can stop the birth of something that has no life or mind \nor substance, but if anyone can figure it out it’s you. I’ve never met anyone so \ngifted at understanding that strange dream-logic of the fears, and if what I \nsuspect about this new power is true, it could be catastrophic. Until then, I’ll \nkeep searching for evidence, trying to find instances and manifestations of The \nExtinction. I’ll keep you updated. \nStay safe. \nAdelard. \nMARTIN \n(Exhales) So that’s it, is it? \n[Static rises] \nPETER \nIt is. \nMARTIN \nA new Power. \nPETER \nThe Extinction, yes.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 4, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 3876}}
