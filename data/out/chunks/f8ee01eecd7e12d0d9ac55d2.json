And that’s when Arthur proposed his own \nplan. A chosen one. We would create a messiah, the Flame Incarnate, one who \ncould usher in this new world and lead us in what Diego called the Scoured \nEarth. \nWhen we finally decided, it was Eileen Montague who came forward as a \nvolunteer. She was five months pregnant at the time, and had already taken \ncare of the father in the usual manner of our little congregation. Some \nobjected, said that unless the child was conceived of the flame, it could never \nbe a true incarnation, but they had no idea how such a conception could \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 139 – Chosen \n4 \n \npossibly even work, so it was decided that it would have to be enough to birth \nthe child by fire. \nWe burned down five acres of woodland to create the site. At the centre of the \nblackened, ash-covered forest we build a pyre, so high and strong that the \nflame would be clear for miles, and so cunningly built it would catch in \nmoments.

We prayed, \nand sacrificed, and anointed her body with holy oil and a crown of kindling. I \nprotested the last one, felt we could do better than to ape the Christians, but I \nwas shouted down. \nAt last the hour was at hand, and as the first contractions started, Arthur \nstruck a match. The fire was so immediate, so intense that I was almost \nbrought to my knees, the light of the pyre so bright for a second, before it \nturned inwards, robbed of its glow and comfort, and turned entirely into \nblistering and unbearable heat. It covered Eileen in a second, flesh blackening \nand cracking, lips parting in a scream that was all at once agony and joy and \nterror and communion, as layer after layer of skin and muscle and bone were \none by one destroyed by the force of the flames, until at last nothing remained \nof her but ash and bone. And on top of that, sleeping peacefully among the \nfire, a baby: untouched, unharmed, and to our eyes alight with a burning \ndivinity. We baptised her with the boiling water of Asag and named her Agnes, \nas had been her mother’s final request. \nBut, raising a messiah, as it turns out, is a lot more challenging than creating \none.
