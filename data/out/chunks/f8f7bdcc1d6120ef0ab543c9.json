Committed to tape \n9th October 2014. Gertrude Robinson recording. \nGERTRUDE (STATEMENT) \nI always knew what sort of a thing war was. Even when everything was going \nto hell, even when it just plain stopped making sense, and what I was seeing \nand hearing was obviously ghosts and monsters, even then it still didn’t \nsurprise me. Not really. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 137 – Nemesis \n \n2 \n \nI never wanted to join up, never cared about fighting for my country. I mean, \nwhat, like my country ever fought for me? No. No government ever gave a \ndamn about me, and I didn’t feel like I had anything needed paying back on \nthat front. Add to that I was terrified. I’ll admit it, the thought of marching off \nto war set my whole body shaking, and I can still remember the nightmares I \nhad when I got the notice. I was half an inch from going conchie, going to \nprison and taking my lumps, but in the end it was my dad that pushed me into \nthe uniform. And it wasn’t an argument, or a telling off that did it either. He \njust looked so damn proud when I told him: his son, the soldier. Don’t know if \nI’d ever seen him look at me like that before, and I just didn’t have the heart to \nbreak it. Me going conchie would kill him, so I had to learn to kill others. \nAnd that’s the thing that really scared me, you know? I wasn’t scared of dying, \nnot really. Everything dies in the end, and the chaplain says you end up with \nGod. Who am I to say different? Even if it’s just sleep, just a quiet nothing \nforever, it’s not like you know enough to be bored, is it? \nNo, death ain’t scary. But killing? That’s scary. To look another living thing in \nthe eyes and end it forever, strip away everything they could have been, could \nhave done or felt. Nobody should ever have to do that. Sergeant once told me \nit’s no different from killing a chicken back home, but people aren’t chickens, \nand the idea that war strips us all down to just a body that moves and kills, or \nfalls and dies, makes me feel sick to my stomach. And I don’t like killing \nchickens either. \nBut none of my feelings mattered in the end. I got the uniform, the training \nand the gun, then ended up shipped off to the Pacific to fight the Japanese. \nI’ve got no desire to share the details of my service. They’re not memories I \ncare to dwell on, and they’re certainly not why I’m here. Let’s just say that", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 0, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 2916}}
