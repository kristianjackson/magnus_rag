And there was one other assistant, whose… whose name I \ndon’t recall, but the last I saw of him, he was being pulled into a great, \npulsating pile of meat. \nI don’t know how I escaped. Perhaps because I designed the house, I knew \nhow to best move through it. Perhaps I was sensible enough to steer clear of \nthe rooms that had fallen into darkness, or burned with a fire that seemed to \nleave the books untouched. Perhaps they let me go. Or perhaps, once again, it \nwas simply luck. \nI didn’t look back as I fled. Nothing seemed to chase me, at least not then. I \nhad none of the books with me, and that was what they were after. Of course, \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG080 – The Librarian \nby the time I realised that, there were many others who were hunting me. \nMostly vengeance-minded folk who had lost someone to the books, plastered \nwith my name, that were now free once again. It was easier to let the world \nthink I was dead and, to one degree or another, I’ve been in hiding ever since. \nARCHIVIST \nHuh. You’re right. \nLEITNER \nAbout which part? \nARCHIVIST \nYou were a fool. \nLEITNER \nHmm. \nARCHIVIST \nWhy didn’t you burn them? \nLEITNER \nPride. If they were destroyed, what was I to guard? Even so, I don’t believe \nthat would have solved as many problems as you think. Many of them \nwouldn’t have burned, and some even liked the flames. And those that did, I \nnow believe, would have been released to take a different form. \nARCHIVIST \nBut you didn’t know any of this when you had almost a thousand of them in \nyour care? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG080 – The Librarian \nLEITNER \nI’ve spent twenty years trying to learn from my mistakes. \nARCHIVIST \nYou said you didn’t take any of them with you, so where did you get these? \nLEITNER \nWhen I started working with Gertrude, she hunted down some editions I \nthought might help. \nARCHIVIST \nAnd why was Gertrude helping you? \nLEITNER \nAside from my knowledge about the books? I think she was lonely. I didn’t \nmeet her until about six years ago, after she’d lost the last of her own \nassistants. She would mention them sometimes. I believe she missed having \nsomeone to talk to on occasion. \nARCHIVIST \nI… I didn’t know Gertrude had assistants. \nLEITNER \nOf course. Three of them, each meeting an unpleasant end. So, when she \nfound me, it seemed natural that we help each other. In this instance, that \nmeant finding certain useful books. \nARCHIVIST \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG080 – The Librarian \nLike The Key of Solomon? \nLEITNER \nThat one was a mistake. I thought that, in the tunnels, there might be the \nstability to examine it properly, learn something of the forces arrayed against \nus. But it went wrong. We had to destroy it. I should have known, really. It was \none of the few volumes that contained elements of several different powers. \nARCHIVIST \nYou keep talking about these… powers? These forces arrayed against you. \nWhat are they? \nLEITNER \n(Sighs) I’d hoped you would at least know that much by now. But I suppose \nyou are simply the observer, and making these connections is not your role. \nGertrude could be much the same at times. \nARCHIVIST \nJust tell me! \nLEITNER \nThere are… entities in this world. Beings of vast, dark power. Perhaps it would \nbe more accurate to say they are ‘next to the world’, rather than in it. Their \ntrue existence could not function in the universe we live in, at least not as it is \nnow. They have nothing in their pure state that could be present in the \nphysical world so they sit in… \nARCHIVIST", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 4, "chunk_count": 9, "chars": 3563}}
