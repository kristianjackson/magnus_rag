He \ntold me, with flies buzzing around his fevered head, ‘You see, doctor, I am such \na restless man.’ \nThe limb was more elaborately adjusted and everything was left in excellent \nposition. Next morning, however, the restless man was found lying upon the \nfloor of the marquee, and in his bed was a man who had been shot through the \nchest. The marquee was crowded and the number of beds were few; those who \ncould not be accommodated on beds had to lie on stretchers on the ground. \nThe man who was shot in the chest had come in during the night, and had been \nplaced on the only available stretcher. \n\nAmherst proceeded to tell me that he was happy to share what little he had \nwith those in need. I… I will grant I was uncertain of how to proceed, when the \nman who was shot in the chest died unexpectedly, his wound turning septic \nwith great rapidity, and in due course the restless man was back in his own bed \nonce more. \nIt was not, however, for long, for on another morning visit Amherst was found \non the floor again, and again beamed forth an explanation that one of the \nwounded on the ground, who had come in late, seemed to be very bad and so \nhe had changed over. The present occupant also died of an infected wound \nwithin hours of my noticing. I was deeply shaken by this odd harbinger of \nsickness and fatality, but could think of no immediate redress for the matter. \nHowever, the moving of a man with a broken thigh from bed to ground and \nback again means not only such disordering of splints and bandages but no \nlittle danger to the damaged limb. So I felt almost a relief when the wound \nturned gangrenous with such alarming speed that amputation was simply \nimpossible. As he passed away, the second time, I implored him to stay that \nway. He just looked at me: \n‘But you see, doctor, I am such a restless man.’” \nPretty spooky, right? You can see why I wanted to bring this to you guys. I \nmean, I know it’s not exactly having my own statement, my own brush with \nthe darkness that lurks behind the shadowy veil and preys on the unwary \nmankind, but it’s the next best thing, right? I’ll be honest, I didn’t really read it \nfully before bringing it over here, I thought you’re probably in a better position \nto do that, with your researchers and that, but there was one other bit I wrote \nout. It was in a worse state than the others, but it was the final chapter, \n\nChapter Thirty. In the original it recounts the rather miserable death of a \nsoldier as contrasted with battlefield heroics, and is titled “Sic Transit Gloria \nMundi”. In this version it doesn’t have a title, and it goes like this: \n“I remember at Chieveley one morning before breakfast, watching a solitary \nman approach the hospital lines. I knew it was him long before my vision \nbecame clear. He was now staggering towards the hospital, a ragged, broken-\ndown, khaki-coloured spectre of a man. He dragged his rifle along with him, his \nbelt was gone, his helmet was poised at the back of his head, his tunic was \nthrown over his shoulders; he was literally black with flies. \nHe told me he had come from the concentration camps, that there were many \namong the Boers that shared his state, and that he longed to touch me with all \nthat we had visited upon them. He talked of disease, putrefaction, and the \nwrithing creatures of filth. He breathlessly talked of his revelation. Then he \ndied, as did the man who came to bury him.” \nSo yeah, I reckoned it might be right up your street. Consider the book a \ndonation. It’s not quite as cool as having a real close encounter of my own but \nit’s the next best thing. Be careful carrying it, though, those old pages are kind \nof sharp. \nARCHIVIST \nStatement ends. \nMr Russo was found dead in his home on June 5th 2003, two days after his \nstatement. Cause of death was found to be blood poisoning from a wound in \nhis hand. Given that the medical records Sasha dug up seem to indicate the \nputrefaction was far more advanced than the timeframe would reasonably", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 3, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 4101}}
