I only bring this up \nbecause Neil had… well, I suppose you could call it something of a totem. It \nwas an old Victorian syringe, which he claimed had belonged to this illustrious \nancestor of his. \nI don’t know if it was true or not, but Neil certainly treated the thing like a relic. \nHe kept it in excellent condition, with glass shining and brass polished, and \nwould carry it around in a small case tucked into his lab coat pocket. Whenever \nhe was called upon to do any calculations or look over results, his hand would \nslip into that pocket, and he’d gently clutch that case. So, you can imagine that \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG045 – Blood Bag \n4 \n \nit came as something of a surprise when he came to me, and asked for my help \nin selling it. \nNow, according to Neil, our project’s grant money had run out, and without \nalternative sources of funding, we weren’t going to be able to continue the \nwork. I’m not sure how much I believed him, as the word around the lab was \nNeil had something of a gambling habit. In fairness to him, I’d heard all sorts of \nbaseless gossip flying around about everybody, and honestly don’t know how \nthe money worked for our project. I’d just signed the contract and took the pay \ncheques, it never occurred to me to investigate our funding myself, so he \nmight have been telling the truth. He might have been trying to save the \nproject. It didn’t really matter, as by this point Neil and I were quite close, so… \nif he asked me to do him a favour, I wasn’t exactly going to refuse. \nWhen I say he asked for my help selling it, that’s not exactly accurate. He’d \nalready found a buyer, some antiques dealer who Neil said had offered him six \nfigures for it. That sounded mad to me. I mean, it was a valuable trinket, sure, \nbut… that’s all that it was. Neil didn’t seem entirely convinced the guy was on \nthe level either, which was why he asked me to come along. \nI’m a big guy, six foot seven, fourteen-and-a-half stone, so I can cut a pretty \nintimidating figure if I need to, especially if you don’t know that I’ve never \nthrown a punch in my life. That’s what Neil wanted me to do, just be there, \nhave his back while he went to meet this guy, so he’d know not to try anything. \nI don’t remember the name, I’m afraid, but he was foreign; Indonesian, I think, \nor Samoan. \nI expected the meeting to be after dark in some dingy dockyard, but as it \nturned out they’d arranged to meet at The Three Greyhounds pub in Soho the \nfollowing afternoon. I wanted to dress to intimidate, but I didn’t really have \nany appropriate clothes, so I just wore a suit. As it turned out, I needn’t have \nbothered – this overly generous antiques dealer was almost as big as I was, and \nunlike me, he looked like he could handle himself. \nHe didn’t even look at me when he entered the pub, almost deserted at that \ntime on a Tuesday afternoon. He sat opposite Neil, while I stood awkwardly \njust outside their booth. They talked hurriedly and quietly to each other, and I \ncouldn’t make out many of the words, though it seemed like they were just", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 2, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 3163}}
