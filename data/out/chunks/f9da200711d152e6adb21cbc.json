Perhaps I just didn’t know the true joy of vertigo. It doesn’t \nmatter. In the end I threw myself into the arms of that vast emptiness, and I \nbound my tormentor to the book. \nThat’s… that’s all, I think. Since then I’ve embraced my new life; gladly fed that \nwhich feeds me. \nA… uh, a Paris skyscraper, was it you said? I honestly, I, I can’t say I recall it in \ndetail, but that does… sounds about right. Sometimes it’s hard to keep track. \nMIKE \nHm. You know, that was… that was nice. I’m not, not usually the sort for \nspeeches. That was… pleasant change. So. \n[The sound of rushing air as the Archivist gasps for breath] \nOff you go, then. \nARCHIVIST \nI, er… You – \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG091 – The Coming Storm \n9 \n \nMIKE \nArchivist. Take my mercy and leave. You have touched something few ever \nwalk away – \n[Someone knocks at the door] \nI thought you said you came alone? Hm. \n[Mike opens the door] \nCan I hel– UGHH! \n[Sounds of a scuffle.] \nARCHIVIST \nDetect… Detective? \nDAISY \nShut up. He human? \nARCHIVIST \nWhat? \nDAISY \nIs this man human? \nARCHIVIST \nI… Er, no, I, I don’t think so. Not anymore. \nDAISY \nRight. What does it do? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG091 – The Coming Storm \n10 \n \nARCHIVIST \nEr, he… It feels like, he makes you… Vertigo. Like you’re falling. \nDAISY \nHas he killed people? \nARCHIVIST \nEr, y-y-yes. Yes, a few, I think. \nDAISY \nDoes he need to see you to do it? Does he need to speak? \nARCHIVIST \nI-I-I don’t know. \nDAISY \nOkay. \n[The sound of kicking] \nDoubt he can do it in a coma. Now turn that off, and help me get him in the \ncar. Don’t try to run. \nARCHIVIST \nWhat are you – \n[Daisy punches the Archivist] \nDAISY \nWhat did I say about questions? I said turn that off! \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG091 – The Coming Storm \n11 \n \n[Tape clicks off. Tape clicks on. There’s the sound of wind, as if outside. \nVoices are muffled.] \nDAISY \nThis is it. \nARCHIVIST \nSo… so what now? You kill us? \nDAISY \nYou think he’s going to save you? \nARCHIVIST \nWhat? What, no – \n[The sound of a gun being fired. The Archivist shouts in surprise.] \nDAISY \nNow… let’s see the bag. \n[The bag is unzipped] \nDAISY \nOne wallet, brown leather, no cash. One packet cigarettes, Silk Cut. One \nlighter, gold, spiderweb design. One pocket knife… blunt. Huh. One set of keys \nto the Magnus Institute. And one tape record- \n[The voices become clearer as she finds the recorder.] \nYou sneaky little freak! You want to record this? Alright. I’d have to destroy it \nanyway. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG091 – The Coming Storm \n12 \n \nARCHIVIST \nWhat, I? I, I didn’t – Pl-please don’t shoot me. Why are you doing this? Tell me! \n[The Archvist makes a gurgling noise, as if Daisy has grabbed him around the \nneck.] \nDAISY \nStop… asking… questions! That’s how you want it? Fine. You brought a knife. \nSo we go through the voicebox. \nBASIRA \nDaisy! Daisy, put him down. \nDAISY \nYou been following me, Basira? \nBASIRA \nDidn’t need to. I know what you do here. \nDAISY \nHe tell you? \nBASIRA \nHe didn’t need to. You’re not that subtle. But I – I always thought you just \nkilled monsters. \nDAISY \nI do! \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG091 – The Coming Storm \n13 \n \n[Sounds of someone struggling] \nBASIRA \nJust let him go. \nDAISY \nYou don’t know what he is. You don’t know what it’s like to have your secrets \npulled out like teeth, just because he asked? \nARCHIVIST \nI’m sorry, I didn’t – \nDAISY \nShut up! \nBASIRA \nDaisy! \nDAISY \nDon’t you… Don’t you dare look at me like I’m crazy! It got you too, or do you \nthink we gave him those tapes because we like handing out evidence? \nARCHIVIST \nWhat? \nBASIRA \nThat’s not how it happened. \nDAISY \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG091 – The Coming Storm \n14 \n \nNo? You ask me to take a tape over to this murdering freak, and I’m all set to \ntear you a new one for it. But then I get the cassette in my hand, and suddenly \nall I want to do is deliver his tapes, and spill my guts. \nBASIRA \nSo, so now you kill him? \nDAISY \nFirst him, then his creepy boss. \nBASIRA \nThis is too far, Daisy. You know it is. \nDAISY \nHe murdered two people, Basira. Maybe more. I’ve done one monster today, \nno reason not to do another. \nARCHIVIST \nI didn’t… I didn’t kill anyone! \nBASIRA \nFor god’s sake look at him! \nDAISY \nThen who? \nARCHIVIST \nI thi- I thi- I think it was Elias.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 3, "chunk_count": 5, "chars": 4313}}
