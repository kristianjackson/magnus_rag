There have also been a few jewellery pieces \nthat found their way to other museums, and once we found a box of 17th \ncentury erotic poems that I think are currently languishing in the storerooms of \nthe V&A museum. But I never found anything like what was under 100 Pall \nMall. \nWe’d been called in to do some work on the basement and ground floor of the \nReform Club. It wasn’t anything major. Some upkeep on a few of the historic \npieces, replace a few of the earlier renovations. The amount of actual work \ninvolved was minimal, but it was a Grade I listed building, so the amount of \ncare we had to take stretched it into a week-long job. It didn’t help that we had \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG035 – Old Passages \n3 \n \nto schedule around the fact that it’s still a very active social venue, so we could \nonly actually come out of the basement when it wasn’t full of people too \nimportant to see builders. Grade I listing is a significant payday, though, so I \ncertainly wasn’t going to rock the boat. \nIt was about two in the morning when the kid showed up. It was just me and \nRachael Turley, who does most of our marble work, though we were mostly \njust doing surveying at that point. Alfred Bartlett was out getting coffee, \nthough god knows where from at that time of night. We were mostly just \nkicking our heels really, since he’s the plumber and we needed his expertise. \nNow Alf has been in the business for nearly 40 years, and there wasn’t a thing \nhe didn’t know about water or sewage systems, but we often joke that it’s \npushed everything else out of his head. I think he must have forgotten to lock \nthe door when he headed out, and that’s how the kid got in. That said, this was \nstill the first week in March and it was pretty cold, so I’m surprised we didn’t \nnotice the draught. \nIn the end I suppose it doesn’t matter. The fact is that Rachel and me had been \nsat there chatting for maybe five minutes when we noticed we weren’t alone. \nIn the doorway leading back to the stairwell stood a thin figure. He looked to \nbe in his late teens, I’d guess. He was dressed all in black, with heavy looking \nboots and a T-shirt with the logo of some band emblazoned on it, Megadon or \nMastodon, or something like that. His hair was long and greasy, almost down \nto his shoulders, and looked to be dyed almost the same black as his clothes. \nHe did not look like he was supposed to be skulking round the Reform Club, \nbut I’d encountered more than one member whose rich children were going \nthrough a ‘rebellious period’, so couldn’t be entirely sure. I decided to be \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG035 – Old Passages \n4 \n \ngentle in my initial enquiries and asked him if he was lost, told him this part of \nthe basement was off-limits due to renovations. \nThe kid shook his head and asked if we’d found anything yet. Any of “Leitner’s \npages”. Now this took me aback a bit. I wondered how long he’d been standing \nthere, because Rachel and I had just been talking about the man. Jurgen \nLeitner was a businessman from Norway, I believe, who used to have offices in \nthe ground floor of the building next to the Reform Club, 100 Pall Mall. I don’t \nknow what his business was, but when I was first getting started, back in ‘87, \nwe got a call from Mr. Leitner, requesting a consultation in his Pall Mall office. \nBack then it was just me and Rachel, and we mostly did stone restoration and \nalteration, so we assumed Mr. Leitner wanted our opinion on a property \noutside of London. Our reputation back then was not sufficient to get us access \nto any of the sort of Central London buildings we now work on. \nWhen we first met Jurgen Leitner, he looked very much like I had imagined \nhim. Portly, middle-aged, short blond hair in the middle of going grey, well-\ntailored business suit. His office surprised me, though, as it was almost \ncompletely bare, save for a desk and two chairs in front of it. There were no \ntables or bookshelves or filing cabinets or anything like that. He asked us to sit \ndown, and though he spoke with a very faint accent, his English was perfect. \nWe made small talk, but he seemed impatient, eager to talk about whatever it \nwas he wanted us to do. \nI asked him what the job was, and he stopped and looked at us closely. Then \nhe said he simply wanted us to dig a hole. An unusual request, but not an \nunreasonable one, so I asked him where it whereabouts this was going to be. \nHe rose, walked over to the corner and pointed at the", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 1, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 4500}}
