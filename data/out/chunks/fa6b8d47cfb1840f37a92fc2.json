The walls of my house were slick with \nmoisture now, and there was nowhere I could go to be dry, no way out of this \noppressive, cloying damp. \nThen the thunder came for the last time. It shook and rattled with more force \nthan it ever had before, and the empty oak wardrobe fell over with a crash. I \nran to the window and saw that the floodwaters were rising again, but faster \nthis time and not because of any rain. The house, the street, the world, was \nsinking into that unending line of water which I was now certain stretched out \nto the horizon. Inch by inch, foot by foot, everything was descending into the \nwater’s embrace. It would wrap itself around me, reach down my throat and \nfill me with its choking darkness. There was nothing I could do. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 129 – Submerged \n14 \n \nAs the water reached the top of the stairs and started to flow outwards, \ntowards my open bedroom door, I looked around desperately for any escape \nthat I might have overlooked. And I saw something lying just behind the fallen \nwardrobe. It must have fallen there months ago. It was the worn leather \nsheath to my grandfather’s kukri. I walked over and picked it up. I stared at it. I \ncould feel that warm, grasping water cover my feet, my ankles, slowly working \nits way up my calf, but in that moment all I could think about was my \ngrandfather and how he had looked when they gave him his diagnosis: calm \nand solid. He had thanked his doctor without hesitation, and although I knew \nhe had been afraid, he had spent those last months methodically preparing for \nthe end. He had always endured his problems, never tried to squirm out of \nthings he felt he had to face. I gripped the sheath in both my hands and waded \nto the window. Corpses floated by slowly, waving at me gently, their lifeless \nhands grey and bloated. I ignored them and stepped out into the water. \nI don’t know if you’ve ever drowned, but it’s the most painful thing I’ve ever \nexperienced. I tried to remain calm, to think on my grandfather and his firm, \nstony face, but even he had begged for painkillers at the end. Even he had \nbeen afraid. My lungs spasmed painfully, desperately trying to wring air out of \nthe warm, rancid water that filled them, and as I felt the water embrace me \nfully, pressing in on all sides, I gripped the last connection I had to the world I \nknew. The last thing I was conscience of was the water getting colder. \nI don’t remember them fishing me out of Regents Canal, or most of my \ntreatment, to be honest. At a certain point it all blurs together. I’m alive, that’s \nwhat matters, and I’ve been living with my sister and her husband for a month \nor two. She doesn’t believe me, of course, and is keen to put the whole thing \nbehind us, though I catch her staring at me sometimes.
