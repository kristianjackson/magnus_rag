You know, \nthis place goes through nurses at an alarming rate, and I couldn’t help but \noverhear your little problem. \nBASIRA \nReally don’t need your opinion on this. \nHELEN \nGood to see you too, Basira. You’re looking well. And don’t worry, I’ve no \ninterest in your little ethical wobbles. No, I mean your issue with a certain feral \nrunaway. I can help you, if you’d like. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 177 – Wonderland \n38 \nARCHIVIST \nNo, thank you. \nBASIRA \nWhat sort of help? \nARCHIVIST \nYou can’t be serious… \nHELEN \nSee, John, this is what I like to see! A proactive attitude, keen to work together. \nSomeone really living their best apocalypse. \nBASIRA \nI asked you a question. \nHELEN \nYou did, didn’t you? I can offer a shortcut. Take you right to that murder \nmachine you call a partner. \nMARTIN \nBasira, John can’t go through Helen’s doors. We couldn’t come with you. \nHELEN \nBasira is a strong, independent woman. She doesn’t need you two holding her \nhand. Anyway, it’ll be dead quick. Two minutes, door-to-door, quick shot to \nthe back of Daisy’s head, and we’ll be home before you know it. \n(Beat) \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 177 – Wonderland \n39 \nARCHIVIST \nYou just heard what The Spiral does to people — you can’t trust her. \nHELEN \nNonsense! Martin can vouch for me. You and... what’s-his-name went through \nMichael’s door, right? And he was rubbish compared to me. \nMARTIN \nWe were in there for two weeks. \nHELEN \nExactly! And you’re just fine! Better than fine! Flourishing! \nMARTIN \nYou really don’t care, do you? \nHELEN \nAlright, be like that. Under new management, anyway. So what’s it going to be \nBasira darling? Quick and easy? \nOr are you looking to take the long way round as the third wheel? \n(Beat) \nBASIRA \nI’ll stick with the guys, thanks. \n(Helen makes a disappointed noise) \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 177 – Wonderland \n40 \nHELEN \nSuch a shame. And here I thought you were actually going to follow through. \nAh well, good luck. And do give my best to Daisy. If you ever do find her. \nBASIRA \nYou done? \nHELEN \nOh, John? Not to sound like a squeaky hinge— \n(Annoyed sigh from the Archivist) \n—but do try to lighten up. Don’t get me wrong, the brooding thing’s a good \nlook on you, but it is starting to get a bit tired. Especially now you’ve got \nsomeone else to do the intense, driven thing. I think you might need to get a \nnew schtick. \nARCHIVIST \n(Sarcastic) Thank you for the feedback. I’ll try to bear it in mind. \nHELEN \nIt’s all I ask! Anyway, I should be off. Don’t want to be late for rounds. Ciao! \n[Footsteps head off] \n[The high-pitched tone ends] \nMARTIN \n(Sighs) Is it me or is she getting worse? I think I preferred it when she wasn't \nquite so...
