I think that’s normal, at least. I’ve never considered myself to have a \nnervous disposition, but maybe other people just get on with things and don’t \nworry so much. \nStill, since Diane died my nights have become a constant vigil. No house is \nsilent if you listen hard enough, and since ending up alone, I have been \nlistening so hard that at points I have to remind myself to breathe. Now every \nsoft groan of the settling house is the sound of some violent thug or burglar in \nmy home, waiting to see if they need to kill me. Marcus has suggested I get a \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG027 – A Sturdy Lock \n3 \n \npet so the house doesn’t feel so empty, but I’ve never had a pet before, and \nI’m too old to learn now. \nGiven how alert and paranoid I generally am when trying to sleep in an empty \nhouse, I’m sure you can imagine my terror when I heard something outside my \nroom one night about a month ago. I’ve lived in the same house since I married \nDiane, and I know every squeaky floorboard. It was the one just at the top of \nthe stairs. I waited, desperately straining my ears to hear any other sound of \nmovement. I had heard no windows break or doors open downstairs, and I \ndefinitely hadn’t heard anyone coming up the stairs, but I was convinced there \nwas someone there. I could feel their presence waiting on the landing. Had \nthey realised how loud the floorboard was? Were they stood there, \nmotionless, listening for any movement from me just as keenly as I was \nlistening for them? \nThen the sound came again, and I was sure there was someone stood at the \ntop of the stairs, but rather than staying there, I began to hear the heavy tread \nof what was unmistakably footsteps. At first I… simply lay there, paralysed with \nfear, thinking that I would just… stay, let them take anything they wanted from \nthe house, and call the police once they had left. But from what I could make \nout they didn’t seem to be going into any of the other rooms. They were \nslowly, and deliberately, walking towards my bedroom. \nThe door does have a lock on it, but it’s been so long since I even thought to \nuse it that, at the time, I couldn’t even think where the key might have been. \nMy heart almost stopped when I heard the door handle rattle ever so gently as \na hand was placed upon the other side. And slowly, so painfully slowly, the \ndoorknob began to turn. In a burst of adrenaline I didn’t even know I was \ncapable of I sprang out of the bed and across the room. I seized the handle and \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG027 – A Sturdy Lock \n4 \n \ntwisted it back the other way, using both hands to try and match the strength \nof whoever was on the other side. \nStill the handle tried to turn, with a slow, relentless effort that spoke of \npatience and determination, but sheer panic lent me equal strength. My hands \nbegan to grow wet with what I assumed, at the time, was sweat, and I worried \nabout keeping my grip. I did, though. For twenty long minutes, I wrestled in the \ndark over the door handle of my room. I could have reached the light switch, \nbut that would have meant having only one hand to keep on the door, so I \nstayed in the dark. \nThen all at once the pressure vanished. The handle no longer tried to turn. I \nhad heard no other sound from outside, though. No footsteps leading away, no \nsound of someone going down the stairs, the house was just silent. I stood \nthere for the rest of the night, the handle gripped tight. And it wasn’t until the \nfirst rays of sun peeked through the windows that I found I had the courage to \nopen my bedroom door and look outside. Nothing. \nI was so stiff that I could barely walk back to my bed and dial the number for \nthe police. It was as I reached for the phone that I looked at my hands and saw \nthat what was on them was not sweat. It was blood. I checked all over my \nhands and arms for cuts or injuries. Nothing. And the door handle was \ncompletely clean. I washed my hands thoroughly before I dialled 999. \nThe police came and they listened patiently to my story. They checked all \naround my house, but there were no signs of any intruder. All the windows and \ndoors were still firmly locked and there was no sign of forced entry, nor had \nany of my possessions been taken or even moved.
