I remember the feeling, but not the event. One \nmoment I’m playing amid raindrops the size of blueberries, and the next I’m in \na white hospital bed, that acrid smell still surrounding me, and these lines of \nagony just carved through my skin. \nThe doctors told me there would be no long-term damage from my accident. \nThey, they were wrong, of course, but the damage wasn’t something they \ncould see, so how were they to know? Sitting alone in my room, tracing the \nlines of electricity with my finger, imagining my pain travelling these branching \npathways. I was obsessed with it, and every time my finger reached the end of \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG091 – The Coming Storm \n5 \n \nthe line I felt a jolt of fear, because I, I knew they went further, went deeper \nthan would show on my skin. \nBy age ten I was reading everything I could on what had happened to me. \nElectricity, Lichtenberg’s experiments, meteorology. My parents thought it was \nsimply my way of recovering, of processing my trauma, but there was \nsomething else there. I know that now. \nDid you know that Lichtenberg figures are fractals? I didn’t, not back then, but \nas they travelled along the length of my scars, I sometimes think like my \nfingertips could feel it. When I was twelve, curled under my bed to escape the \npounding of the rain against my window, the roll of thunder that just rattled \nmy skull, I began to travel them once again. My hands ran down and along \nthose jagged, discoloured lines, every branch, every turn, my nostrils full of \nozone, my veins full of fear. And they didn’t stop. I knew where my scars \nended, but… those I traced in the dark that night, they just went on and on and \non, far beyond me and to somewhere that still flashed with that unspeakable \nwhite light. \nThat was the night everything changed. Before it I was odd, certainly, probably \ntraumatised, and gripped with a terror of storms, but after that night, things \nwere different. I think, looking back, that was when I called it. That was when it \ncaught my scent. \nIt delighted in toying with my perceptions, making me believe a storm was \napproaching, forcing me to run for shelter or desperately hunt for cover \nwithout warning. In the dark it would stand beneath my bedroom window, the \nlight flaring, flashing the awful brightness of sheet lightning across my room. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG091 – The Coming Storm \n6 \n \nI could never look directly at it. The bright, arcing glow of its insides almost \nblinded me when I tried. It was almost a man, but I could never be sure. Its \nstrobing, flashing Lichtenberg organs changed and flickered too fast. It… never \nhurt me. Not once in all the years I was chased by its… malevolence. Of course, \nI know why that is now, but at the time it did nothing to dull my fear. \nI remember when it found out where I lived. I had dreamed that night of \nshifting, branching avenues of light. I travelled them so fast I could feel my \nflesh peeling away, leaving nothing but the coursing, buzzing pain within me as \nI ran down these hideous corridors, aching for an end I knew simply wasn’t \nthere. I woke up screaming into the darkness. Walking to the window, I looked \nout over the tiny garden below. I was sixteen at the time, and the house I lived \nin had a small patch of green behind it, just fighting against the pressing grey of \nthe city, the dull glow of the light pollution overhead. But where the back wall \nshould have been, there was a small wooden gate. \nI didn’t feel the cold as I opened the back door, and walked out towards it. \nMy… my tormentor was nowhere to be seen, but the blackened edges of the \ngate showed clearly it had passed by. Was I afraid? It’s hard to remember now, \nbut I have to assume that I was. I mean, I must have been. As I pushed the \nancient hinges back to reveal this darkened forest, how could I not have been? \nIt stretched away forever, I think, or as close to forever as the human mind can \ncontain. The trees were long and spindly, their branches bare and reaching, as \nthey grew down towards me out of the sky, their roots pulsing upwards into \nthis roiling mass of clouds; the scorched and shattered trunks reeking of ozone. \nI found The Journal of a Plague Year when I was seventeen. I was lucky, I \nsuppose, that it wasn’t anything worse. It infected the house, of course,", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 1, "chunk_count": 5, "chars": 4408}}
