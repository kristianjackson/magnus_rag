They are content and safe and happy in this place, and only \nscream so loud from sheer hatred of the idea that any might make noise \nexcept themselves. On their thighs can be seen the glint of gold from the great \npolished nails they have driven through their legs and into the chairs, \ngangrenous wounds that ensure they shall never have to rise again, their \nposition utterly secure. \nOn his side of the arena the shouts should be sharper, more angry, but their \ntone and pitch are such as to merge seamlessly with the others. There are no \ngolden stakes on this side pinning down his would-be comrades. But the \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 189 – Peers \n \n16 \nminister must be careful not to look too closely, or else he might see how \nmany of his allies are fused to their own chairs, on which they have sat \ncomfortable for so long. \nHis eyes drift away, through the walls to the crowd outside. Their baying cries \nfor justice cannot be heard in here. If any whisper should make it through, it is \nutterly destroyed in the deafening shouting that surrounds him. But he cannot \nforget their eyes, watching him, piercing him with their wounded humanity. \nThe minister swallows, and tries to speak over the din. \n[Leather creak as the Minister stands] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nAt first his words are lost, vanishing into the cacophony without a ripple, but \nthey are words, clear and distinct from the shapeless expostulation of his \npeers. And as he says them, one by one the others fall silent, their disgusted \nattention landing on him until his own voice falters in the sudden quiet. \n[Gradually the clamour of voices stops; it is suddenly very quiet \naside from the soft creaks and shuffles of many attentive people] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nAcross the pit the pallid things gurn at him in indignant curiosity, while on his \nside he is surrounded by expressions of horrified betrayal. \nThey can all hear him now. Any words he speaks will ring out through the \nchamber. He wants to talk of the people outside, the bruised and abandoned \nones that suffer and die to slake their appetites. He wants to cry for restitution, \nfor justice, for a future, for anything. But all eyes are on him and he falters. He \nremembers the cold, the hunger, the ache of concrete beneath him. He is \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 189 – Peers \n \n17 \nafraid. And his chair is so very comfortable. The minister coughs, once, \nuncomfortably, and sits down. \n[He coughs and sits] \n[A bell sounds over and over, followed by scuttling and sounds of \ncrockery being placed] \nAs he does so the great bell tolls for dinner, and a thousand scuttering servants \nswarm out and into the chamber, depositing their silver trays before each seat, \npiled high with succulent, steaming meat. \n[Sounds of consumption and cutlery] \nThe minister eats as those outside look on, and all he tastes is salt. \n[Hissing static starts] \n[The extreme surveillance sounds from outside the \nPanopticon resume] \n[Hissing static ends] \nMARTIN \n(Brightly) All good? \nARCHIVIST \nYes. Just, uh... Left a little bit of a bad taste in my mouth. \nMARTIN \n(Unusually upbeat) Oh great! Fantastic! \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 189 – Peers \n \n18 \nARCHIVIST \nMartin? Wh— Something’s up. \nMARTIN \n(Blasé) No! No, nothing’s up. Everything’s just — still awful. \nARCHIVIST \nWhy are you smiling? \nMARTIN \nI’m… just… really happy to see you. \nARCHIVIST \n(Demanding) Martin? \nMARTIN \nAh well! Looks like we aren’t getting in here! Never mind! Better… Best head \noff then, eh? \n[They start walking] \n(Beat) \nARCHIVIST \nWhat’s going on? \nMARTIN \n(Hissed whisper) It’s fine, just trust me. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 189 – Peers \n \n19 \nARCHIVIST \nMartin, this is not the sort of place where acting strange means I will still ju— \n[The Archivist exclaims in shock as a hatch opens and he is bundled \ninside] \n[Fast domain-transition static and glitches] \n[Harsh metal scrape as the hatch is pulled back into place] \n[Their words reverb on barren concrete and corridors; the tunnels] \nMELANIE \nShut! up! \nGEORGIE \nIt’s alright John just, keep quiet. \nARCHIVIST \nWha— Georgie? Melanie? I thought— This— \nMARTIN \n(Whispering) Sorry. Sorry, John. I’m-I’m not sure how much everything up \nthere actually understood what was going on. But, y’know, I didn’t want to \ntake any chances so it made sense to... um… \nARCHIVIST \nPut on a show? \nMARTIN \nAh, yeah, basically, more or less.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 4, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 4478}}
