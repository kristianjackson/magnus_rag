All told, I think taking \ndown three of them was a pretty good effort. \nIt was hot that day. I hadn’t been in the desert more than a couple of weeks by \nthen and the sheer heat of the place was still something of a shock. I’m from \nCheltenham, you see, so not exactly used to the blazing sun of a Libyan desert. \nAnd the Crusader, well, for all its advantages, didn’t have very much in the way \nof ventilation, so we were spending a lot of time trapped in what was more or \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 053 - Crusader \n5 \n \nless a mobile oven. Even then, I could just about stand it, but once the fighting \ngot going and the gun started firing… well, it was only a two pounder, but still... \nthe heat was almost unbearable. \nIt was about two hours into the battle that it happened. The gun was now so \nhot I couldn’t touch it and I was having to wipe a steady stream of my sweat \nfrom my eyes every few seconds. The whole desert seemed to swell and sway \nin the heat haze, but I dimly heard Frank call an order to fire on a tank from the \neast. Ralph brought the Crusader to a stop and I heard poor Dickie call from \ninside that we were clear to fire, swearing all the time over his burnt fingers. I \ncould see the dark shape of an Italian gun in the distance and was trying to get \nthe angle right, but my vision was so hazy from the intense heat that it was \nhard to focus my binoculars properly. \nThen I saw it: a flash of light. A twinkling glint of sun from the enemy tank. In \nthe back of my mind, I knew what it meant: the sun reflecting off their own \nbinoculars, which were trained on us. But my head was so foggy that for all the \nworld it seemed as though they were winking at me. I tried to say something to \nthe rest of the crew, but my mouth was too dry and all that came out was a \ndull croak. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 053 - Crusader \n6 \n \nIt was strange, but even with the intense sunlight reflecting off that endless \nexpanse of bright desert, I still remember seeing the flash of their gun. I didn’t \nhear it though. They always say that, don’t they? That you never hear the shot \nthat gets you? Well, I certainly didn’t. \nThen I was on the ground with Frank and Ralph standing over me. Ralph was \ntrying to say something, but I couldn’t hear it over the intense ringing in my \nears. There was the smell of burning metal and below it another scent I \ncouldn’t quite place. I tried to sit up, but there was such an intense shooting \npain in my left leg as I did so that I collapsed again. A few yards away I could \nhear our Crusader, smoke pouring from her cracked armour. It surprised me \nhow intact she seemed, until I saw the flames creeping up from the hatch. \nIt was then that the ringing in my ears faded enough for me to hear it: the \nscreaming from inside the tank. Dickie was still in there. I looked at my \ncompanions and saw in their faces that they heard it too. There was nothing \nthey could have done to save the poor fool, of course. If they had trapped him \nin there, then getting to him would have been impossible and trying would \nonly have got them killed. So I had to lie there and listen to Dickie roast to \ndeath. I don’t know how long it took, but it felt like hours.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 1, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 3443}}
