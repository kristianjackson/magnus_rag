And I don’t want that to include me. Or Melanie. \nMARTIN \nMaybe he just needs some help. \nGEORGIE \nI did help him, as much as I safely could, but he just carried on anyway— \nMARTIN \nYeah, he’ll do that … \nGEORGIE \n—and I realised if I kept trying it was going to hurt me more than I was willing \nto accept. \nMARTIN \nWell, sometimes helping people hurts. \nGEORGIE \nSure, but that doesn’t mean everything painful helps. Sometimes people have \nproblems that will wreck you long before you can make a dent in them. And \nsome people don’t want help; they just want other people suffering with them. \nMARTIN \nJohn doesn’t want that. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 149 – Concrete Jungle \n13 \n \nGEORGIE \nHe doesn’t know what he wants. And from the sound of things, he’s run out of \ntime to figure it out. \nMARTIN \nIt’s easy to pass judgement from the outside. \nGEORGIE \nOne more reason to stay on the outside. \nMARTIN \nA-a-and wh-what, you think Melanie’s worth saving? \nGEORGIE \nIt’s not about worth, but yeah, she’s actually trying to get well, so I’m going to \nhelp her. \n MARTIN \nThis place isn’t a sickness. \nGEORGIE \nNo, I think it’s worse. \nMARTIN \nLook, we’re all just trying to do the right thing. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 149 – Concrete Jungle \n14 \n \nGEORGIE \nMaybe. Look, life forces you to make hard decisions, but I can never trust \nsomeone who goes around looking for hard decisions to make. \nMARTIN \nAnd what do you mean by that? \nGEORGIE \nJumping on a grenade is only heroic if you weren’t the one who actually threw \nit. \nMARTIN \nThat’s not what’s happening. \nGEORGIE \nOkay. It’s still not something I want any part of. \nMARTIN \nWell, lucky for you, we’re fully staffed, so— \nMELANIE \nHey, you ready? \nGEORGIE \nOh, yeah, whenever you are. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 149 – Concrete Jungle \n15 \n \nMELANIE \nWho were you talking to? \nGEORGIE \nOh, I was, um… \n… \nHuh. No-one, apparently. \nMELANIE \nYeah, this place will do that to you. Come on. \nGEORGIE \nSure. \n[Tape clicks off.] \n[The Magnus Archives Theme – Outro] \nThe Magnus Archives is a podcast distributed by Rusty Quill and licensed under \na Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Sharealike 4.0 International \nlicence. \nToday’s episode was written by Jonathan Sims and directed by Alexander J \nNewall. \nIt featured: Alexander J Newall as Martin Blackwood, Sasha Sienna as Georgie \nBarker, and Lydia Nicholas as Melanie King.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 6, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 2455}}
