The builders had clearly been in already, and marked various areas with \nspray paint. It was a bit disconcerting, as the shade of red they had used kept \nmaking me think that they were blood splashes, so I was leaning towards the \n‘creepy old hospital’ angle. There was also the normal, actual graffiti, of \ncourse. Mostly the standard collection of tags, names, but there was one that \nstood out. It was in what had eventually become the children’s ward; over a \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG028 – Skin Tight \n9 \n \nmural of Winnie the Pooh, someone had scrawled in black spraypaint the \nwords “Silk will not stitch the butcher’s meat”. So… yeah, by the end we’d \npretty much settled on going for the spooky angle. \n \nWe hadn’t had any encounters though, so once we’d got the main footage we \nneeded, we headed into the main ward, now a huge, empty room, with only \nthe metal skeleton of curtain runners around the top. We set up the detection \nequipment, and bedded down for the night. Each of us had a watch, so as to \nmake sure that someone was awake for any contact. I was hesitant to give \nSarah a shift, as she’d be acting so strangely the entire time, but when she \nvolunteered for the 2am to 4am shift, y’know, no-one wants that one, I, I \ncouldn’t easily say no. \nI was on the shift before, and there didn’t seem anything much to report.

When 2am rolled \naround, I walked over to where Sarah lay sleeping. She hadn’t been smoking \nfor a while, of course, and that weird floral perfume of hers was stronger than \never. I reached out to touch her on the shoulder and wake her up, when she \nrolled over and looked right at me. There was no sign of fatigue in her eyes, \nand I couldn’t help but wonder if she’d been asleep at all. Or maybe just lying \nvery, very still. I tried not to think about it as I crawled into my sleeping bag on \nthe cold hospital floor, and the last thing I heard before I drifted off was the \nclick of Sarah Baldwin’s lighter. \nI woke up about an hour later. I don’t know what woke me, but the others \nwere all still asleep. I realised that I couldn’t smell cigarettes, and looking \naround it appeared Sarah had wandered off. It was almost pitch dark, with only \na small amount of moonlight creeping in through the boarded windows. I", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 3, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 2741}}
