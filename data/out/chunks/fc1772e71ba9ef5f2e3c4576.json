The Magnus Archives. Episode one hundred and sixty-\nseven: \"Curiosity.\" \n[Theme finishes] \n[Tape clicks on] \n[A wasteland wind swirls; footsteps on gritty ground] \n[Hissing static starts] \nARCHIVIST \nHelp us with what? \nMARTIN \nExcuse me? \n \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 167 – Curiosity \n2 \nARCHIVIST \nAnnabelle, help us with… what, our, our, our journey, killing Elias, vanishing the \nEntities— what? \n[They stop walking] \nMARTIN \nPlease don't do that. \nARCHIVIST \nDo what? \nOh, oh, right, ye-, I see, yes. Well, I— Sorry. \nMARTIN \nIt doesn't… feel great, having someone looking inside your head. \n[They start walking] \n[Hissing static ends] \nARCHIVIST \nYou can… feel it? \nMARTIN \nNo, but that's hardly the point, John— \nARCHIVIST \nOh, no, I see, sorry, um, right. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 167 – Curiosity \n3 \nMARTIN \nI mean, I don't want to keep secrets from you, but— \nARCHIVIST \nYou should at least, be able to. \nMARTIN \nBasically, yeah! \nARCHIVIST \nI-I suppose that's fair. \nMARTIN \nIt's just— it's weird knowing that you can know literally everything I think and \nfeel. E-especially since you're not exactly the most open of people, \nemotionally, I mean. \nARCHIVIST \nWhat that's not fair; I share! \nMARTIN \nSure you do. \nARCHIVIST \nI do. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 167 – Curiosity \n4 \nMARTIN \nOkay, so how exactly would you describe your current emotional state \nregarding all of this? \nARCHIVIST \nGah— \nMARTIN \nGo on, I'm all ears. \nARCHIVIST \nI feel… \nMARTIN \nMm-hmm? \n[Backpack zippers jangle as they stop walking again] \nARCHIVIST \n(Sigh) I feel… sad. \nMARTIN \n(Flat) Sad. \nARCHIVIST \nVery sad. \nMARTIN \n(Flat) Very sad. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 167 – Curiosity \n5 \nARCHIVIST \nYes, alright; point taken. \n[They start walking] \nMARTIN \nYou said you could control it now. \nARCHIVIST \nI can, I, I just— I— \nYou're absolutely right. I will refrain from knowing anything about you. \nMARTIN \nThank you. \nARCHIVIST \nUnless you're in danger. \nMARTIN \n(Laughingly) Physical danger; If I'm in danger of being mad at you or \nsomething— \nARCHIVIST \n(Crosstalk) I— \nMARTIN \n—you've got to figure it out the old-fashioned way. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 167 – Curiosity \n6 \nARCHIVIST \nFine. Agreed. \n(Sighs) \nSo. What did Annabelle say? \nMARTIN \nShe offered to help, but she didn't say what with; she asked us where we were \ngoing; I didn't tell her, but... it was pretty obvious she had a good idea? \nARCHIVIST \nDid you, feel like she was influencing your mind at all? \nMARTIN \nI don't think so, but I mean... who knows? \nARCHIVIST \nI could. \nMARTIN \n(Getting forceful) But look. She didn't control me into asking you not to look \ninto my head, if that's what you're thinking. That's all me— \nARCHIVIST \nMartin, I'm not looking for a loophole. \nMARTIN \nWell, good, 'cause this isn't one. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 167 – Curiosity \n7 \nARCHIVIST \n(Teasing) Methinks the Spider doth protest too much. \n[Martin stops walking] \nMARTIN \n(Annoyed) John— \nARCHIVIST \nJoking! Just joking. \n[They start walking] \nMARTIN \nDo you know where she was calling from? \nARCHIVIST \nNo. She, no. She's still… hidden, somewhere; I, I can see her voice coming \ndown the phone line, but the closer it gets to her the harder it is to see. \nMm, Christ, this all feels so… obtuse; it's like, I have the power to drink the \nwhole ocean, but I have to do it through a straw. \nWhat? \nMARTIN \nJust, I don't know, it-it worries me, I guess? You know, when you do the whole- \n(imitating the Archivist) ‘curse this flesh prison’ thing, it, I get you're different; \nnone of us are what we were, but, well? It worries me. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 167 – Curiosity \n8 \nARCHIVIST \nSorry. \nMARTIN \nThat's not… It's okay. \n(The Archivist sighs) \nMARTIN (CONT’D) \nAnyway, my flesh prison (small laugh) would like to stop for a bit. How far until \nthe next... domain? \nARCHIVIST \nA while. If you want to stop, it's as good a place as any. \nMARTIN \nNo, I just, need a moment. (sigh) One where I'm not just relentlessly pushing \nforward. \nARCHIVIST \n(Large sigh) Alright, we can stop. \n[They stop walking and sit down] \n(Long beat) \nMARTIN \nWhy did it have to be us?", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 0, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 4360}}
