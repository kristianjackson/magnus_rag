In the centre of the room stood that strange \nhypnotic table, though how he had gotten the heavy wooden thing down here \nwas beyond me. The whole place was covered with a thick gossamer of \nspider’s web, and in the thick clumps around the edges of the chamber, I saw \nshapes I recognised. Doris Hardy, Dick Barradale, Greg Montgomery – the older \nones, who had left the house before I had. They lay still now, wrapped in their \nsticky cocoons. Their bodies seemed warped and bloated in a way I didn’t \nrecognise, but that’s only because, at that point in my life, I had never before \nseen a spider egg sac. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 059 – Recluse \n12 \n \nIn the chair sat Raymond Fielding. He looked the same as ever, that placid \nunreadable smile still on his face. His brown leather coat seemed to shift \naround his body, the texture in the dim light seemed more like coarse fur. He \ndidn’t say anything, just watched as I continued to make my way towards the \ntable. For all the terror strangling my heart at that moment at the discovery of \nthe grotesque fate of my friends, I could still feel the bland, uncaring \nexpression on my face, and found myself stood in front of the table as though \nnothing whatsoever was wrong. \nI reached over and pulled the wooden square from the centre of the table. On \nits own, it appeared to be a small wooden box, and the lid opened smoothly as \nmy hands moved in a practised motion. Inside was an apple, green and fresh \nand still wet with morning due. I knew I was going to eat it. I could feel tears \ndesperately trying to push themselves out of my eyes, but I instead decided \nnot to cry. I placed the box down on the table, reached over and picked up the \napple. \nAll at once, my cheek erupted in pain. It was like someone had pressed a hot \nbranding iron into my face, and I could swear that I heard the flesh sizzle as I \nlet out a scream and fell to my knees. I raised my hands to my face and realised \nin that moment two very important things. The first is that my face seemed to \nbe untouched and I could feel no injury or burn. The second was that raising \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 059 – Recluse \n13 \n \nmy hand had been a truly voluntary act. I had willed it myself and whatever \npower had been gripping me, tugging me into its web, I was free of it. I looked \nat Raymond Fielding, whose face finally had a real expression on it: one of \nconfusion and anger. As he stood up, I saw small, twitching shapes tumbling \nout of his jacket, and I ran. I ran up those stairs, out the door and away into the \nnight. I didn’t look back and, to this day, I pray every night that the others \ndown in the basement were already dead. \nThat’s it, really. Within two hours, I was out of Oxford on the first train I could \njump onto. I jumped off at Birmingham to avoid a ticket inspector, and that’s \nwhere I spent the next several years. Given my start in life, I’ve done very well \nfor myself and I now have comfort, education and money. I try to think that \nI’ve left my past behind, but that sort of denial doesn’t help me sleep. I only \nhad my first truly restful night since that day after reading about the fire that \nburned the house to the ground, but now they’re building there. They’re \nbreaking ground that should be left burned and empty and I’ve started to \ndream again. \nARCHIVIST \nStatement ends.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 5, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 3450}}
