I returned to the \nTundra, tried to forget, but the trouble was I'd tasted the game now, and I was \nstill hungry for more. \nI suppose that's why I was so keen when Elias contacted me. We'd kept in \ntouch, of course, my family helped fund the institute, and he'd always been \ngood about tipping me off to potential victims. Going through something \nhorrific can leave you feeling very isolated indeed, especially if you know no-\none else will believe you. And of course, he knew I find it hard to resist a \nwager. \nIf I could convince one of his staff to willingly pledge themselves to the Lonely, \nit was all mine. He even let me pick the victim. He was so sure the prize of the \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 159 – The Last \n \n16 \nInstitute, the Panopticon, and a willing vessel to use it would be just too much \nfor me to resist. And he was right. Just didn't go quite as I'd hoped. \nYou know, this is one of the first bets I ever made with him that I’ve actually \nlost. But I guess that’s how hustlers work, isn’t it? They lose and lose until \nyou’re willing to put it all on the line and then... the trap shuts. So I suppose \nthat's probably why I reacted so rashly, trying to rip his victory away, keep you \nhere. But it looks like I might have underestimated my opponent once again. \nARCHIVIST \nAnd what was his prize? What did he get if you lost? \nPETER \nOh, he got you. \nARCHIVIST \nI-I don’t understand. \nPETER \nAnd you won’t. Not from me. I’m done. \nARCHIVIST \nTell me. \n[Hissing static starts] \n[The Lonely static gets louder] \n[Footsteps] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 159 – The Last \n \n17 \nPETER \n(Fighting) I’m… not saying… another… word. \nARCHIVIST \nTell me or I will rip it out of you! \n[Both statics keep increasing in volume] \nPETER \nNo! \nARCHIVIST \n(With all his power) ANSWER MY QUESTION! \nPETER \nNO!! \nLEAVE! \nME! \n(Echoing) ALONE! \nARCHIVIST \nTELL ME! \n[The statics crescendo; there is the sound of electric tearing and \nPeter screams as he is conceptually ripped apart] \n[The hissing static ends; the Lonely static becomes faint] \n(The Archivist is breathing heavily) \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 159 – The Last \n \n18 \nARCHIVIST \n(Quietly) Stubborn fool. \n(Beat) \nARCHIVIST \n(Whispered) Martin. \n[Martin is there] \nHe’s gone, Martin. He’s gone. \n(Martin’s voice slowly shifts from side to side, trailing echoes) \nMARTIN \n(Flat) His only wish was to die alone. \nARCHIVIST \nTough. N-now, listen to me Martin, l-listen... \nMARTIN \nOh. Hello, John. \nARCHIVIST \nListen, I know you think you want to be here. I know you think it’s safer, and… \nwell maybe it is. But we need you. I need you. \nMARTIN \nNo you don’t. Not really. Everyone’s alone but we all survive. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 159 – The Last \n \n19 \nARCHIVIST \nI don’t just want to survive. \nMARTIN \nI’m sorry. \nARCHIVIST \nMartin. Martin look at me. (compelling) Look at me and tell me what you see. \n[Hissing static starts] \nMARTIN \nI see... I see you, John. \n(Small disbelieving laugh from Martin) \n(Martin’s voice stops shifting side to side, and no longer echoes) \nMARTIN (CONT’D) \nI see you. \nARCHIVIST \nMartin... \n[Hissing static ends] \n[They embrace] \n(Martin makes sobbing breaths) \nMARTIN \n(Emotional) I was on my own.
