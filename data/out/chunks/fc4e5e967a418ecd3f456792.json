As my turning of the pages became more and more \nfrantic, I spotted a look on the face of this new mother. It was amused, almost \nmocking, and I became sure that she knew. Whoever this woman that called \nherself Rose Cooper was, she knew it was a lie as much as I did, and my \nconfusion and fear delighted her. \nFor all that, though, I was at a complete loss to explain any of it. Every piece of \nphotographic evidence I can find supported this woman’s claim to be my \nmother. My father’s memories agreed, as did the memories of the two \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG077 – The Kind Mother \n7 \n \nneighbours I was able to talk to the following day – Tom Harrison and Joanne \nFisher. Both of them told me that they’d known George and Rose Cooper since \nthey’d moved in, and when I asked them to describe Rose, they said she was \nmedium height with a kind, round face and long, curly white hair. \nI even took a walk up to the Church of St. Peter’s, where I knew my mother \noccasionally visited, to ask the vicar, a polite man named Neil Angus. He told \nme the same thing as the others, though he did ask after my mother’s health. \nApparently, she’d had a bit of a fall the week before outside the church, and \nthe vicar had come out to help after hearing her cry out. He turned a bit pale \nwhen he said this. I pressed him further, and he told me that, although she’d \nseemed fine when he had reached her, the scream was like nothing he’d ever \nheard. \nI asked the woman who is not my mother about her ‘fall’ near the church. She \nlooked me right in the eyes, smiled, and said it was nothing. She’d just had a \n“bit of a funny turn”. \nThat’s it, really. I left immediately and haven’t been back. I’ve never been a \nbeliever in the supernatural before, but it seems clear to me that something \nattacked my mother near St. Peter’s church, killed her and somehow replaced \nher completely. The only piece of evidence I can find is the recordings I’d made \nof her beforehand. The tapes still have her real voice on. I have a few, so you \ncan have one for whatever tests you might want to do. I’m going to go back to \nmy father and play him the others. Maybe it’ll jog a memory or maybe he’ll try \nto have me put away. Either way I have to try. \nI used to think I hated my mother; I really did. But now I can’t stop listening to \nthose tapes, now I know they’re the only way I’ll ever hear her voice again. All \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG077 – The Kind Mother \n8 \n \nof them except the tape we recorded on the old myths of the fae, of \nchangelings. I’m not ready to listen to that one yet. \nGERTRUDE \nFinal comments: Unfortunately for Ms. Cooper’s attempts to convince her \nfather, it appears George Cooper died of carbon monoxide poisoning from a \ngas leak two days after this statement was recorded, before her next visit. No \nother bodies were found and there has been no sign of anyone identifying \nthemselves as Rose Cooper since. \nBased on the interactions and effects, I suspect this to be the creature that \nAdelard Dekker refers to as the “NotThem” in statement 9910607. If the \npattern of behaviour is consistent with what he establishes, then further \nfollow-up on this case is pointless: the thing has finished with the Cooper \nfamily and will not be revisiting them. It rarely seems to stay in the same place \nor with the same people for long, though it’s hard to guess at its motives. \nPersonally, I suspect it to be an aspect of The Stranger, though that’s entirely \nconjecture at this point. \nWhat puzzles me more is why one or two people can always see through it. \nThe sheer power that it must be able to call upon to be able to rewrite so \nmuch of reality, seemingly as a reflex, is staggering. So why does it always miss \na few witnesses? It is at least reassuring to know that magnetic tape seems to \nescape being overwritten, so if I get changed, you can be sure this is my real \nvoice. Based on Dekker’s statement, it would seem Polaroids are also relatively \nstable. Beyond that, I find it comforting that this creature appears content to \ntravel freely sowing random terror.
