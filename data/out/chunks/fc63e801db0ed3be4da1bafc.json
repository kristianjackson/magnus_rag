Does this seem about \nright to you, so far? \nMARTIN \nYeah. \nPETER \nNow, from my point of view, so far, none of this has been any of my business. \nWe have bigger concerns than this little soap opera you call an archive. What \ndoes puzzle me, though, and I mean that genuinely, is why you were piling \ntape recorders onto the coffin while John was in there? \n… \nIt’s a question, Martin. It’s not an accusation. \nMARTIN \nI don’t know. I just felt like it might help. He’s always recording; I thought it \nmight help him find his way out. \nPETER \nInteresting. Were you compelled? \nMARTIN \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 134 – Time of Revelation \n \n16 \n \nI don’t know... Maybe? I definitely wanted to do it. \nPETER \nBut? \nMARTIN \nI’m not sure where the idea came from. \nPETER \nYou should watch out for that. Could be something dangerous. \nMARTIN \nSure. \nPETER \nI can’t help but notice you’re recording right now? \nMARTIN \n(Defensive) It was a statement, alright? That’s what we do. \nPETER \nAnyway, point is, I’m not your captor or your torturer. I’m not going to tell you \nto stop talking to him, or even saving him, if it comes to it. If that’s not a \ndecision you are willing to make yourself, me scolding you isn’t going to help. \nYou know what the stakes are now, and I just have to hope you’re with me on \nthis, focusing on the big picture. \nMARTIN \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 134 – Time of Revelation \n \n17 \n \nYeah. \nPETER \nOkay. Now, I really am running late, so if you don’t mind? \n[Tape clicks off.] \n[The Magnus Archives Theme – Outro] \nThe Magnus Archives is a podcast distributed by Rusty Quill and licensed under \na Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Sharealike 4.0 International \nlicence. \nToday’s episode was written by Jonathan Sims and directed by Alexander J \nNewall. \nIt featured: Alexander J Newall as Martin Blackwood and Alasdair Stuart as \nPeter Lukas.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 7, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 1983}}
