Its body was fat and \nbulbous, with no limbs or head, so when it came towards me it did so with a \nslow, undulating pulse along the floor. I could see its outside was covered in \nwhat might have been feelers or fleshy tubes, and as it gradually made its way \ntowards me I could see them flicking out and spasming wildly, in what looked \nhorribly like excitement. \nInstinct, honed throughout my entire childhood, kicked in and I pulled the thick \nblanket I was under up and over my head. I gripped the edges close to my \nchest, weeping and muttering desperate prayers. I clung to it, my tiny island of \nsafety and protection, not even daring to stick my arm out to grab my phone \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG086 – Tucked In \n12 \n \nfrom the nightstand. Who would I have called, anyway? Who could possibly \nhave been prepared to deal with something like this? \nAs my mind raced through the possibilities, I gradually began to realise that I \ncould hear nothing from beyond the blanket, nor did it appear I had been \ndevoured by whatever the thing in the darkness was. Very gently I poked my \nhead out from my sanctuary. It was still there, looming in the doorway, utterly \nstill. As soon as I saw it, though, it convulsed back into movement and started \nonce again making its way towards me, painstaking and slow. I dived back \nunder the covers, gripping them tighter than ever. \nAnother hour passed, and then two, but it was only when I poked my head out \nthat the thing would move. As ridiculous as it sounds, it seemed that while I \nwas under the covers it couldn’t move. It couldn’t get me. \nI stayed under the rest of the night. When the daylight began streaming in the \nnext morning, I finally left the safety of my bed to see what had become of the \nthing. It was gone, unsurprisingly, and in its place there was simply a small \npatch of dark, foul-smelling water. \nI wasn’t quite ready to celebrate, though, and the following night proved me \nright. Because it came back. I woke again, and saw it start that twitching, \ntorturous journey towards me. So back under the covers I went, heart racing, \ndesperately trying to think through what might be happening to me. In \nretrospect it’s odd that at no point did I even consider that I might be \nhallucinating. I never had any doubts that the thing was real. At some point I \nfinally fell asleep, and I guess I managed to stay under that blanket. \nThat’s been my life for the last week and a half. I wake up, gripped by terror of \nthe dark, and hide under the covers from this thing that only comes closer \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG086 – Tucked In \n13 \n \nwhen I leave their protection. It’s been awful, obviously, but in the end it \nwasn’t the gradual wearing down of my nerves that got me. If anything, it was \nthe opposite. I got too comfortable. \nLast night I woke up like before. I sensed it there, but as I raised the covers \nover my head, I realised that I wasn’t worried. Fear had given way to routine. I \nlay there, warm and protected, and simply waited to fall back to sleep. But this \ntime, what I felt instead was a sudden weight pressing down on the end of my \nbed. Whipping tendrils began to smack and grasp against my flimsy fabric \nbarrier. I could see that shape of absolute darkness looming over me, quivering \nwith triumph. Then I heard a voice, crisp and clear, whispering. \nAnd it said, “The blanket never did anything.” \nI won’t describe what happened after that. You’ve taken plenty of photos of \nmy back and shoulders already. To say it hurts is the least of its horrors. That \nthing will come for me again tonight, I know it will, and there is nothing that \ncan protect me. I just thought sharing my story might help some other poor \nidiot in the future. \nI miss my blanket. Hiding was always so much easier. \nMELANIE \n(Melanie claps again) Marker. \nUh, statement ends. \nWell, er, that was… I suppose this is what I do now. Um… there, there aren’t \nany photos in the file, er, certainly not of weird supernatural injuries. There’s a \nphotocopy of a death certificate for Benjamin Hatendi – looks like Martin has \nhighlighted the cause of death. Says “Unknown – possible biological agent.
