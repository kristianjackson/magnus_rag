My apologies. \nHELEN \nSo, where’s the old ball and chain? Surely you’re not paying me a visit on your \nlonesome? \nARCHIVIST \nI am. \n(Intake of breath) \nYou gambled right. \nHELEN \nI’m sure I don’t know what you mean. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 187 – Checking Out \n \n3 \nARCHIVIST \nYou hoped that by nudging us past his domain, Martin would still be there \nwhen I arrived… so I would have to pass through on my own. Apparently, you \nwere right. \nHELEN \nI thought you said you weren’t going to look inside people’s heads? \nARCHIVIST \nI thought you said you weren’t people. \nHELEN \nTouché. \nARCHIVIST \nWell for what it’s worth, I have tried not to look inside you. \nHELEN \nOh yes? \nARCHIVIST \nI maybe glimpse a motive, sometimes, but I try not to stare. \nHELEN \nI’m touched. Any particular reason for this monumental restraint? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 187 – Checking Out \n \n4 \nARCHIVIST \nThe same reason you don’t want Martin here. I wasn’t sure I wanted to kill \nyou, and… you don’t want to die. \n(Beat) \nHELEN \nHe’s still so new to all of this, caught up in ideas of justice and ‘solving’ things. \nSure he can wave away the theoretical idea of people suffering... \nARCHIVIST \nBut if he sees it up close he might try to get his boyfriend to smite you? \nHELEN \nSomething like that. We’ve built up such a rapport, he and I. I’d hate to strain it \nover such a temporary disagreement. I’m just concerned for his happiness, you \nunderstand. \nARCHIVIST \nCompletely. \nHELEN \nI am a little bit surprised you didn’t follow him. \nARCHIVIST \nHe didn’t want me to. \nI didn’t need special powers to know that. When he crossed the threshold I \nhad to make a choice and— \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 187 – Checking Out \n \n5 \nHELEN \n—and you chose me. \nARCHIVIST \nLet’s say you were something of a branching path. \nHELEN \nHm. Always the flatterer. \nSo, when is he coming out the other side? \nARCHIVIST \nIt might take a while. \nHELEN \nMmm, yeah, these quiet reflective domains sometimes do. Ah well, more time \nfor us to hang out, I suppose. Shoot the breeze, share some hot goss… \nARCHIVIST \nExcuse me while I try to contain my joy. \nHELEN \nYou are excused. So... \n(A door creaks open) \nHELEN (CONT’D) \n…are you coming? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 187 – Checking Out \n \n6 \nARCHIVIST \nI thought we agreed I’m far too all-powerful to cross your threshold. \nHELEN \nDon’t flatter yourself. This isn’t some extension, some limb reaching out to \nsnatch the wayward or the trusting. This domain, this magnificent building is \nme. \n[Helen stretches and sighs contentedly as her building form does likewise] \nHELEN (CONT’D) \nYou’re welcome here. We’ll be quite safe with you travelling through me. As \nlong as neither of us does anything silly. \n[Hissing static starts] \nOr you could just stand there glowering, that’s fine too. \nARCHIVIST \nI’m trying to ‘know’ if there’s another route I can take. \nHELEN \nAnd? \nARCHIVIST \nTurns out there is, actually. But it is rather full of spiders. \n[Hissing static ends] \n[Footsteps start walking away]", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 0, "chunk_count": 8, "chars": 3996}}
