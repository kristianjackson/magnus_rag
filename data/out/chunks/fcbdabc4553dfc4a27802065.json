(small chuckle) You'll see. Now, he'll be here soon, \nso you can leave or— \nPETER \nOh, no. No. I'm not gonna make it easy on him. You haven't won yet. \nELIAS \nYour choice. Just make sure to leave the door open. \n[The Lonely static rises again, before becoming faint] \n(Elias lets out a long, triumphant laugh, then sighs, contented) \n[Tape clicks off] \n[Tape clicks on] \n[Faint sound of the Lonely static] \n[A large echoing space; the panopticon; footsteps] \n(A few seconds of John's laboured breathing) \nELIAS \nAh, John. I was almost worried. You found your way all right? \nARCHIVIST \n(Out of breath) Yes. Y-yes, I did. \n...How? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 158 – Panopticon \n \n34 \nELIAS \nSuffice it to say I called you. \nARCHIVIST \nWhat is this place? \nELIAS \nHmm. A complicated question. And time is— \n[Hissing static starts] \nARCHIVIST \nIt’s the panopticon. \n[Hissing static ends] \nELIAS \n(Pleased) ...My you have grown. Yes. A masterpiece, isn't it? \nARCHIVIST \nYeah. It is. And that's you then? Your... body? \nELIAS \nNot anymore — n-not really, although if you harmed it, it wouldn't go well for \nme. Or any of your friends, for that matter. \nARCHIVIST \nMaybe it's worth it. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 158 – Panopticon \n \n35 \nELIAS \nMaybe. And I'm sure in another circumstance, you would be more than happy \nto take your chances for a shot at revenge. \nARCHIVIST \nBut... \nELIAS \nBut, for Martin, time is very much of the essence. \nARCHIVIST \nWhere is he? \nELIAS \nPeter Lukas has him. Cast him into the Lonely, and with every passing moment \nhe gets further away from you. \nARCHIVIST \nHow do I bring him back? \nELIAS \nFrom out here? Impossible. \nARCHIVIST \nYou want me to follow him? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 158 – Panopticon \n \n36 \nELIAS \nNo, John. You want you to follow him. I simply want you to know that if you do \nso, you are almost certainly not coming back. To go into the Lonely willingly is \nas good as death. \nARCHIVIST \nHow do I do it? \nELIAS \nWasn't too long ago. And I'm sure traces of their passage still remain. Just open \nyour mind. Drink it all in. Know their route, and simply... follow it. \n[The Lonely static starts rising in volume] \nELIAS (CONT’D) \nVery good. \nAre you scared, John? \nARCHIVIST \n(Quietly) Yes. \n[The Lonely static crescendos] \nELIAS \nPerfect. \n[Tape clicks off] \n[The Magnus Archives Theme — Outro] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 158 – Panopticon \n \n37 \nJONATHAN SIMS \nThe Magnus Archives is a podcast distributed by Rusty Quill and licensed under \na Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial ShareAlike 4.0 International \nlicence.
