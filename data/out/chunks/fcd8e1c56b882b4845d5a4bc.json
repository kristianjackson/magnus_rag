Is that a weird thing to say? \nMARTIN \nA bit? \nARCHIVIST \nIt was basically all she talked about. Orsinov. I-It was— How’s everyone been? \nMARTIN \nOh, well, we’ve, we’ve been fine. I mean... Well, not great. Tim’s still... not \ndoing well. Melanie seems okay, but I get the feeling she’s... I don’t know, \nplanning something? \nARCHIVIST \nI- I got that feeling too. \nMARTIN \nBasira’s the only one doing— well, she seems weirdly calm about the whole \nthing. Like it’s… like she’s on a vacation or something. \nARCHIVIST \nMaybe she just suits the academic life. What about Daisy? \nMARTIN \nDon’t see her much. Which is fine by me. \n(There’s a tense pause.) \n\nARCHIVIST \nDoes the rest of the Institute know what’s going on down here? I mean, I never \nreally paid attention, but... \nMARTIN \nN-Not really? I think? I mean, Tim’s been going on about it to anyone who \nlistens, but I think they just... think he’s had a bit of a breakdown. \nARCHIVIST \nWell, I mean… \nMARTIN \nI mean, they can quit. Hannah just left to have her baby, though. \nARCHIVIST \nI don’t know who that is. \nMARTIN \nYeah you do - Hannah? She works in the library. Black, kind of stocky. Had that \nwhole thing with the milk in the break room last year? \nARCHIVIST \nI, er... Sorry. I really don’t... \nMARTIN \nWell, anyway, I… Well, I think they all just see the Archives as kind of weird and \nleave us to it. Y’know? Better us than them. \n\nARCHIVIST \nI mean, they’re not wrong. \n(Another a tense pause.) \nMARTIN \nSo… are you coming back or…? \nARCHIVIST \nI-I-I-I don’t know. Probably not yet. There’s a lot of... I-I think I might be on a bit \nof a treasure hunt. \nMARTIN \nOh? \nARCHIVIST \nTreasure in the sense of the… the world not ending. \nMARTIN \nOh. \nARCHIVIST \nI will keep in touch. I’m, I’m going to need all of you digging into stuff. E-Elias \nmentioned... he said you’d been… reading statements? \nMARTIN \nOh... uh… yeah. Um… He thought it might help. \n\nARCHIVIST \nRight. I-I-I mean, they’re not... They haven’t... You’ve been okay? \nMARTIN \nB-B… Yeah. I mean, i-it wasn’t fun, but... I mean, if it, if it helps then I— \nARCHIVIST \nOkay. If you’re sure, just... Make sure the others help you, alright? Statements \ncan be... If you’re not used to them it can… be a bit weird. \nMARTIN \nEr… Sure. \nARCHIVIST \nAn-Anyway, I-I-I should go. I-I’ve got a few leads to follow up. \nMARTIN \nRight, right. \nARCHIVIST \nI’m, I’m sorry, Martin. We haven’t… I know we haven’t talked much since... \nSasha and everything. \nMARTIN \nWell, I mean it’s not too late, y’know. Unless the world ends. \n(Martin laughs nervously) \n\nARCHIVIST \nYeah. \n[Tape clicks off.] \n[The Magnus Archives Theme – Outro] \nJONATHAN SIMS \nThe Magnus Archives is a podcast distributed by Rusty Quill and licenced under \na Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Sharealike 4.0 International \nLicense.
