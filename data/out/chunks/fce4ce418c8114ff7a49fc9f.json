I \ninstinctively grabbed Fernanda for support, but ended up pulling her down as \nwell, the three of us tumbling down a short, muddy decline and landing hard in \nthe foliage. \nIt took a few moments to pull ourselves together. It wasn’t a huge fall, but I felt \nstrangely disorientated, as I clambered to my feet, shaking my head in an \nattempt to dispel some of the fuzziness that had settled over it. The others \nclearly felt it too, although checking ourselves over it seemed we’d been lucky: \nall we had broken was our equipment, although Dr Anastas whined about that \nalmost as much as if it had been a bone. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 149 – Concrete Jungle \n6 \n \nI tried to get my bearings but, even though we’d only moved a few metres \nlaterally at most, I was finding it really hard to get a solid idea on where we \nwere. I couldn’t figure out exactly which way we had come, and I couldn’t get a \nclear read on the sun through the canopy and clouds. Fernanda wasn’t having \nany better luck with the compasses, as they were either broken or something \nmagnetic in the area was messing with them. They just gently span around and \naround. There was at least something resembling a trail, though not one I \nrecognised. Honestly, we should have just waited it out until we were overdue \nat the facility and they sent out a retrieval team, but that would take almost a \nfull day, and I could see in Dr Anastas’ eyes that there was no way he was going \nto wait that long. So, we picked a direction and started walking the trail. \nWhen I first saw the structures, my instinct was to turn around and go back. \nFrom a distance, they looked like shabono, the huge ring of thatched roofs the \nYanomami place around their settlements for shelter. It didn’t make sense, \nthough. There was no way we’d gone so wildly off course as to end up in the \nIndigenous Territory, absolutely no way. But there was something else. \nSomething about their construction seemed off, wrong somehow. So much so \nthat when Fernanda grabbed my arm and urgently whispered that we had to \nleave, I shrugged her off and headed forward for a better look. That was when \nI noticed how quiet it was. Aside from the rain, the jungle cacophony had \nsimply stopped. \nAs I got closer to the shabono, it became clear what was wrong with it. \nAlthough each roof was thatched like normal, the stands weren’t made of \nleaves, but all kinds of different materials instead: long strands of plastic, \nshards of rusted metal, even oddly shaped hunks of cement. They wrapped \nthrough and around each other like any other thatch, but the texture, the \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 149 – Concrete Jungle \n7 \n \ncolour, everything about it was different in a way that made my stomach \nchurn, though I wasn’t exactly sure why. None of the materials were organic or \nnatural. I shared a look with Fernanda. She didn’t say anything, but she didn’t \nhave to. We both knew how isolationist the Yanomami tended to be, how \nresistant they were to any outside influences. The idea that they would have \nthe desire to build, or even the equipment to build, something like this was \nridiculous. So, what did that leave? Had one of the illegal mining operations \ndone it just to antagonise them? Possible, I guess, but it would have been a lot \nof work for basically no reason. It just didn’t make sense. \nDr Anastas, though, didn’t know enough about the Yanomami or their \nbuildings to be unsettled, and instead voiced his irritation that we were \nstanding around chatting rather than going for help. He walked around to one \nof the gaps in the shabono and headed inside. By the time either of us had \nnoticed, he was already inside. Fernanda and I scrambled after him, \ndesperately hoping that we were good enough communicators to be able to \nconvey apologies to whoever was in there. \nBut the inside was just like the outside, and in the worst possible way. There \nwere no people in there, but that’s not the same thing as it being empty. \nInstead there were ... figures. From a distance, they looked like human beings \nstanding impossibly still, but getting closer quickly revealed the lie. They were \njust the rough shapes, cobbled together out of a hundred different pieces of \ngarbage: a broken metal clothes horse for a ribcage, a plastic chair leg for an \narm, rusted screws for teeth.
