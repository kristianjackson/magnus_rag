A door creaks open. \nWe hear the static associated with The Distortion.] \nHELEN \nHello, John. Been a while since you’ve been down here. \nARCHIVIST \n(Impatient noise) I didn’t come here to see you. \nHELEN \nOh, come now! I’m sure I’m more interesting company than the late Jane \nPrentiss. \nARCHIVIST \nIt’s all that’s left of her now – apart from a jar of ashes in my desk. Just a circle of \nrotten stone on an otherwise-unremarkable wall. \nHELEN \nMore of a legacy than some people get. \nARCHIVIST \nThere was going to be a gate, I think. A hole that she rotted into the Corruption \nitself. Maybe the start of a ritual? \nHELEN \nHmm. Not exactly impressive, is it? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 152 – A Gravedigger’s Envy \n13 \n \nARCHIVIST \nLess complex, certainly… But I think that’s the thing about – what did Elias call it? \n– Filth. I don’t think it really plans much. It just starts to grow wherever it can get \na foothold, and, if no one stamps it out in time… game over. \nHELEN \nHow… clumsy. Though, I suppose it has a certain charm. \nARCHIVIST \nI’ve been wondering what they were doing down here. The worms must have \nbeen down here for – weeks, months maybe, spreading… growing. They could \nhave spread all the way through these tunnels, but they didn’t. They didn’t find \nLeitner down here, didn’t find Getrude’s body, didn’t find… whatever else is here. \nHELEN \nIt is a maze. One of the reasons I like it. \nARCHIVIST \nHmm. \nI can’t See things properly here. I thought it was just me, something interfering \nwith my connection to the Eye, but… I’m wondering: maybe it affects everything \nelse? Like this place is some kind of – universal blind spot. \nEveryone gets lost down here. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 152 – A Gravedigger’s Envy \n14 \n \nHELEN \nWhat a fascinating idea. Although – some of us are always lost, in a sense. \nARCHIVIST \nWait, are you saying you can navigate it? \nHELEN \nNot exactly, but my door has been part of these tunnels for some time now. \nARCHIVIST \nWh – (frustrated sputtering) – what’s it hiding, wh-what’s in the middle? \nHELEN \n(Suppressed laughter) A delightful surprise…! \n(The Archivist signs. Helen laughs the strange, echoing laugh of The Distortion.) \nHELEN (Cont.) \nAh… But that’s not why you’re here, is it? \nARCHIVIST \nYeah. \nI’ve been thinking a lot about Jane. She was the first, you know. The first I actually \nencountered like… like us. \nShe seemed so… inhuman. Like everything she used to be was stripped away. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 152 – A Gravedigger’s Envy \n15 \n \nHELEN \nAnd now…? \nARCHIVIST \nI wonder how much of her was still in there. How much did she choose to be what \nshe was? I read her statement, she was… (inhale, exhale) she was scared. \nI assumed she’d been possessed completely against her will, but now I’m not \neven sure that’s possible. \nHELEN \nIt is astounding the sort of thing you’re willing to choose – given an unpleasant-\nenough alternative – isn’t it? \nARCHIVIST \nHow much of willpower is just – safety? “Comfort” by another name. The option \nto choose and be fine. \nHELEN \nHungry, are we? \nARCHIVIST \n(Angrily) That’s not – \n– I haven’t done anything – \nHELEN \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 152 – A Gravedigger’s Envy \n16 \n \n– yet. \nARCHIVIST \n(Roughly) I feel like if I don’t… I might die. Fade away into nothing. \nHELEN \n… \nDo you… Know that? \nARCHIVIST \nNo. But I… (frustrated noise) I can’t die. They need me. \nHELEN \nCome on, Jon, no excuses. \n(The Archivist sighs.) \nHELEN (Cont.) \nThey don’t need your protection. \nARCHIVIST \nWhat, are you going to look after them? \nHELEN \nAnd how would I do that? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 152 – A Gravedigger’s Envy \n17 \n \nARCHIVIST \nYou eat things as well. \nHELEN \nThey have to open the door, Archivist. I can’t just push them in. \nARCHIVIST \nOh, you’ve got hands. \nHELEN \nSharp enough to pull out worms, kill a few old men – maybe stab an overeager \nArchivist – \n(The Archivist sighs.) \nHELEN \n– but my physicality is as much an illusion as everything else about me. Think of \nme as… a bear trap. Not a sword. \nBut we’re not talking about me, are we? \nARCHIVIST \nWhen does it stop? \nHELEN \n(Impatient) What?", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 5, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 4148}}
