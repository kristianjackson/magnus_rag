I think they were \nfollowing me. I think they followed me here! I saw a spider in the basement \noutside. And, and the webbing, it just… it had this webbing, the sticky kind… \nand I just… I don’t know how I can keep… I just need… This is the first time I’ve \nbeen in a room where I haven’t seen a spider— \nMELANIE (Overlapping) \nI… Please, just… There’s, there’s tea there. Okay. Right. Yes. Okay, breathe. \nYeah… well… Drink, drink the tea \nBRIAN \n—and maybe this is safe— \nMELANIE \n(Laughingly strangled) No-o-o-o-o. No. \nBRIAN \n—or maybe they’re outside. I just don’t know! \nMELANIE \nIt’s really… \nBRIAN \nI don’t know how else— \n \n\nMELANIE \nIt’s really not safe. \nBRIAN \n(Wheezing distressedly) --carry on! \nMELANIE \nI’ll, I’ll get you some biscuits. I’ll get you, I’ll get you, I’ll get you… something… \nJust breathe! \nBreathe for me… \n(Brian takes some deep breaths.) \nOkay, yes. Good. Good. \n[Door opens & closes as Brian continues to breathe deeply] \nBRIAN \nSorry. I know I shouldn’t… I guess that’s… that’s everything. I, I just don’t… Oh. \n[Chair scraping on floor] \n(Calling out) H-Hello? \nSorry. Did I…? I don’t, don’t know… \n[More chair scraping] \nShould I just… go? \nHello? \n\n[Very sharp squeal of distortion] \nPETER \nExcuse me? \nBRIAN \nWoah. \nPETER \nDo you work here? \nBRIAN \nOh, er… no, I… Hi. \nPETER \nI’m looking for Elias Bouchard? He runs this Institute. I do have an \nappointment. \nBRIAN \nI don’t, um… I’m, I’m sorry. I was just, um… but everyone… just went. \nSorry. ‘B-Brian. B-Brian Finlinson. \nPETER \nPeter Lukas. Lovely to meet you, Brian. Now. Am I to understand you don’t \nwork here? \nBRIAN \n\nNo… I was just, um… making a statement, or, or whatever. Um… \nPETER \nThat’s probably for the best. Elias can be quite… ‘protective’ of his people. \nNever really understood why. I mean, in the end, the only person that you \nreally have is yourself. \nWouldn’t you agree, Brian? \nBRIAN \n(Confused) I don’t… What? \nPETER \nWell. Plenty of time to make your mind up, I’m, I’m sure. \nNow… If you’ll excuse me, like I said, I have an appointment to get to. You are \nsure you don’t know where Elias Bouchard’s office is? \nBRIAN \nNo. \nI’m, I’m sorry. \nPETER \nNot to worry. I’m sure I can find it. \nAnd I’m sure you need some time to get used to your new situation. \nBRIAN \n(Softly) What? \n\nPETER \nGood luck Brian. \n[VERY SHARP SQUEAL OF DISTORTION] \nBRIAN \nYeah… Thanks… Uh… I— Oh. \nHello? \nH-Hello? \n[Tape clicks off.] \n[The Magnus Archives Theme – Outro] \nJONATHAN SIMS \nThe Magnus Archives is a podcast distributed by Rusty Quill and licenced under \na Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Sharealike 4.0 International \nLicense.
