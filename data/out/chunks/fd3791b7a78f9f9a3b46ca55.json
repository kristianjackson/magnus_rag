Statement begins. \nStatement begins. \nJONATHAN SIMS \n(Read a loud from the archived witness statement of Antonio Blake) \nFirst off, I should admit that I lied to get in here. I know your criteria are very \nclear: “Any supernatural or unexplainable experience or encounter occurring \nwithin the realms of apparent reality. No out-of-body experiences, visions, \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG011 – Dreamer \n2 \n \nhallucinations or dreams”. And this is about dreams, make no mistake, but I \nthink you need to hear it anyway. \nWhether you believe it or not, well, that’s up to you. I just don’t feel like I could \nrightly go on my way without at least trying to explain myself. You see, I had a \ndream about you. I know how that sounds, and I can assure you we don’t know \neach other, but the Institute, the building, even this room… I saw them in my \ndream as clearly as I see them here before me now. So no, I don’t have any tale \nabout a shambling horror in the dark. I ask you to read on, though, as this \nwasn’t the sort of dream you just ignore. \nI should probably give a little bit of background about myself rather than just \ngibbering about dreams and prophecies. I’ve lived in London for almost a \ndecade now. I came here to do my undergraduate degree at the London School \nof Economics. I ended up taking a position with Barclays shortly after \ngraduating and did well enough there. It didn’t last long, though; I barely made \nit through a full year before the stress of my new job, not to mention some \nproblems in my personal life, led to me having a full nervous breakdown. \nI’d broken up with Graham, my boyfriend of six years and had to leave the \nhome we shared, going to stay with some of the few friends that had survived \nmy year of stress-fuelled outbursts and constantly cancelled plans. It was \nthere, sleeping on my friend Anahita’s sofa, in the depths of my misery, that I \nfirst started to have the dreams. I found myself standing atop the very peak of \nCanary Wharf and overlooking the Barclays building where I had spent so many \nhateful hours. Behind me I could feel the pulsing beat of the light that stands \natop that looming tower; it thrummed through me and I could see the glow \npass across my skin like oil but, try as I might, I could not turn around to look at \nit.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 0, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 3010}}
