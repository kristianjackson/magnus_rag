We wanted to say a few words up top of the next episode. \nFirst up, it is definitely a heavy one, and it’s worth reading through the content \nwarnings and show notes before listening. \nThis episode deals with authoritarianism, imprisonment, and the police as a \ntool of political repression by the state in a general sense. It is rooted in my \nown experiences and those of people close to me. \nTo put it bluntly, there is a reason that police violence is a subject that finds its \nway into a lot of my work. This episode was written as a sincere exploration of \nmy own fears about the rise of authoritarianism and violent repression around \nthe world. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 185 – Locked In \n \n2 \nWe also wanted to acknowledge that, on reflection, we believe this episode \ndoes blur the line between horror and trauma, depicting the awfulness of \ndetainment and imprisonment without much fantastical distancing. \nSeason 5 was always intended to explore more realistic fears through the \nmedium of the hellscapes, but as our world has gotten darker, real-world fears \nand feelings have occasionally bled too directly into the writing of this series, \nand I believe that means I have broken my own rule of avoiding using trauma \nas a direct source of horror. I apologise for this. \nWe will be more careful in future with similar topics. From here on out, while \ncharacters will still fear and suffer and die as part of their stories, they should \ndo so without the show dwelling quite so directly on real-world traumas. \nThanks for listening. \n \n[The Magnus Archives Theme – Intro] \nJONATHAN SIMS \nRusty Quill presents... The Magnus Archives. Episode one hundred and eighty-\nfive: \"Locked In.\" \n[Theme finishes] \n[Tape clicks on] \n[Hissing static] \n[A distant prison door alarm sounds, metal doors slam; there \ncontinuous background sounds of unhappy imprisoned people, \nmany shouting in anger; sporadically metal doors and bangs echo \ndown the corridors] \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 185 – Locked In \n \n3 \nARCHIVIST \nThey have never told her what crime she has been arrested for. She isn’t even \nsure she was ever arrested. \n[Hissing static ends] \n[A metal bench creaks occasionally] \nARCHIVIST (CONT’D) \nThey had walked up to Tina in the street, as she was loading her car with \nshopping, and placed a hand on her shoulder gently but with the certainty of \ngravity. Her fingertips still remembered the chill of the milk as she placed it in \nthe boot of the old Toyota. She had smiled when she turned, reassured by the \nsight of the uniforms, and didn’t even notice the sternness of their expression \nor the fact that the faces beneath the helmets were identical. All day she had \nbeen feeling on edge, smelling the faintest hint of something rotten on the \nwind. Had it been her imagination? No, others had sensed it too, she was sure \nof it. In the shops she had seen them, eyes darting nervously, fingers \ndrumming incessantly on trolly handles, waiting for whatever was coming. And \nall day, that intense, unshakeable feeling that she was being watched. \nSo when she turned and saw them standing there, so official in their vests and \nhelmets, what else was she to think? Ah, thank goodness, it flitted through her \nmind as Tina felt herself relax, whatever it is, someone is taking care of it. \nBecause that’s what they were for, to take care of these problems, to shuffle \npeople away for their own protection, and keep the world working as it should \nbe. She smiled, even as the shadowed figure did not remove his hand from her \nshoulder.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 0, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 3907}}
