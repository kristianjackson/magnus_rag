Honestly, I’d actually appreciate your insight for this \none. Just, you know, keep quiet during the statement and that. \nDAISY \nSure. I can do quiet. \nARCHIVIST \nRight. Uh, do you want a chair? \nDAISY \nNo. \nARCHIVIST \nOh, okay. \nDAISY \nTrying to get my legs right again. \nARCHIVIST \nOf course. \nDAISY \nJust ignore me.

Original statement given June 27th 1930. \nAudio recording by Jonathan Sims, the Archivist. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 133 – Dead Horse \n \n3 \n \nStatement begins. \nARCHIVIST (STATEMENT) \nTell nobody I am alive. I cannot be clear enough on that point. Do not try to \nfind me after I have left. Please. All I ask is that I be allowed to live what life I \nhave remaining in obscurity and anonymity. I will not allow myself to be found. \nPerhaps you will have read reports of my disappearance or death, constructing \nwild theories of violence at the hands of Kalapolo tribesmen or a lack of \nadequate supplies or preparation. I can only wish my hubris had been so \nmundane. \nI was hunting once again for the lost city of Z. I have dreamed of it for decades, \never since I first read Da Silva’s account of his own discoveries in 1753. The \nancient ruins, the statues and hieroglyphics. The sheer, unrivalled beauty of it \nall. Through the trenches and the mud of the Western front, it was the thought \nof Z that kept me going, whispered promises of discovery. The remains of an \nancient city utterly lost to time and hidden somewhere near the Xingu River. \nMy first expedition was alone, save for a handful on indigenous guides. I \nbelieved myself prepared, but the realities of that jungle were more than I \ncould have foreseen, and when it finally ended, my fever-addled mind named \nthat spot, the furthest we had reached into the jungle, “Dead Horse Camp”, \nbecause that is where my horse finally fell. I retreated in defeat and resolved \nto return to Dead Horse Camp at a time when I was truly ready. That time was \nfive years later, in 1925, and I honestly believed that this time I was going to \nfind Z.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 0, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 2706}}
