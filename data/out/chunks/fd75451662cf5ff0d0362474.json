He must be dead. I would love to believe that this is \nall some elaborate prank, some bizarre attempt to fake his own disappearance, \nbut deep down I know that’s not my brother. So he is dead. If not, I can’t even \nbegin to comprehend how dreadful a fate that would be. \nSome fears can only be endured for so long. \nMy brother Grant was always afraid of heights. I remember we used to climb \ntrees as children. He would always get scared halfway up, and it would be an \nhour of coaxing and reassurance before he managed to climb down. He still \ntried to climb them, though. That was my brother: always full of bravery and \noptimism until the moment the terror set kicked in. He never did have the \nstrongest survival instinct. \nGenerally he was fine with tall buildings, if they had a lift. Stairs were often \nmore of a problem, especially if there were windows from which he could see \nthe ground getting further away. Still, the majority of his phobia, strangely \nenough, was focused on ladders. That’s not to say he fainted with horror just \nbeing in the same room as one, just that climbing up and down ladders was a \nparticular sort of torture for Grant. Those few occasions when I saw him do so, \nthe stark white terror I saw etched on his face with every slight rattle or shift of \nthe thing, was enough to convince me that this wasn’t some quirk to be gently \nmocked over Christmas dinner; it was a real and intense manifestation of his \nphobia. \nFor the most part it didn’t affect our lives that much. We shared a small house \nin Jarrow, up near Newcastle, and it took more than a second floor to freak \nGrant out, although he pointedly never climbed the small stepladder that lead \nup to the attic. The living arrangements were less than ideal, as Grant had \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG075 – A Long Way Down \n3 \n \nbeen abruptly fired from his admin position with Deloitte in January so he \ndidn’t contribute much to the house except for an indentation on the sofa. I \nhadn’t really wanted to take him in. I mean, it’s not that I don’t love him or \nanything, he’s my brother, it’s just that we’d always got on best when we spent \nmost of our time apart. Familiarity does breed some sorts of contempt better \nthan others, and I knew that we were unlike to be domestically suited to each \nother, as I am by nature quite fastidious in ways that I know my brother is not. \nHowever, I had recently gone through a break-up, and there were only so \nmany well-meaning hints from my parents about what to do with the newly-\nspare room that, in the end, I caved and invited him to live with me. \nWork had been slow coming for Grant. By the time he lost the job with \nDeloitte, his knowledge of database administration had been so specific and \nspecialist, that he was struggling to find jobs that fit his skillset. Which meant \nmore time for him to spend making our living room look like a bombsite. \nI’m sorry. I know how this must sound, but I feel it’s important you understand \nwhy I took him up to Tour Montparnasse in the first place. I couldn’t have \nknown what would happen. Deep down, though, in the hidden corners of my \nscepticism, I know it’s not my fault. I know it’s because of the man with the \nlightning scar. He did this. I don’t know how and I don’t know why, but he took \nmy brother away from me, and if I ever see him again, I’m going to kill him. \nThe first time we saw him was when I broke my arm. It was about a year ago, \njust after Halloween. \nWe’d both been out to a party the night before; I had managed to lose my \nkeys, and it was only as we approached our front door", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 0, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 4500}}
