Twisting \nmanipulators and furtive liars. Each meeting a violent, grotesque end; each \nwidening the crack just a little. Until finally, a man named Raymond Fielding, a \nsmiling pillar of the community who fostered children into food for his \ngrotesque arachnid god, was murdered by flame, immolated by the chosen of \nthe Ravening Burn. The house of the time was destroyed along with him, \nreduced to ashes, and with that the crack finally became... a gap. \n[An unusual wood creak] \nMARTIN (CONT’D) \nA hole around which time, dimension and reality began to bend, shudder and \nleak. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 196 – This Old House \n \n15 \nAn opening into, we believe, other worlds than this tired old thing. \nIt was not wide enough to allow true passage, not yet, save for the odd \naccident. But it was wide enough for what we now intended… \n(Martin exhales) \nOkay. \nSo. A crack in reality? \nANNABELLE \nOh, it’s so much more than a crack now. It’s an aching hole, a gaping wound in \nthe very fabric of our world. \n[Martin puts down the statement] \nMARTIN \nAnd a gateway to other dimensions. \nANNABELLE \nNot quite yet. \n(Martin exhales slowly as he processes) \nMARTIN \nOooooookay. \nANNABELLE \nDramatic enough for you? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 196 – This Old House \n \n16 \nMARTIN \nSo this is what you wanted me to see? \n…Annabelle? \nANNABELLE \n(Wistful) It’s a real shame, you know. \n[Annabelle stands up and takes a few steps] \nANNABELLE (CONT’D) \nI was so looking forward to filling you with spiders. \nMARTIN \nE— Wh— Excuse me? \nANNABELLE \nThey would have hollowed you out, and worn you like a cheery jumper! \nMARTIN \n(Nervous laugh) Uh, right. But, since you’re telling me I can assume you’re not \ngoing to now, right? \nANNABELLE \nThat’s the thing about webs. People get so caught up on how intricate they \nare, how perfectly constructed. They never consider how flexible they can be. \nThe sort of storm they need to weather. You can’t be precious about a single \nstrand. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 196 – This Old House \n \n17 \nMARTIN \nR-right, yeah, but a-a-again, because you didn’t really answer me, um, filling \nme with spiders isn’t a strand of your web now, right? Um. I-I just want us to \nbe, a-heh, absolutely clear on this. \nA-Annabelle? \n(Beat) \nANNABELLE \nNo. \n(Martin breathes relieved breaths) \nNot anymore. \nMARTIN \nR-r-right, thanks. Sorry. S-s-sorry to interrupt ah, just, just checking. \nANNABELLE \nIt’s such a shame. There was a time when I was certain you had what it takes \nto join us. \nMARTIN \nWhat? Because I like spiders? Well, used to. \nANNABELLE \nBecause you always managed to get what you wanted through smiles and \nshrugs and stammerings that weren’t nearly as awkward as they seemed. \n(Small sound of Martin’s concession to the point) \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 196 – This Old House \n \n18 \nMARTIN \nPoint taken. \nANNABELLE \nBut I didn’t foresee how deep you would fall into The Lonely. Or how far the \nArchivist would go to get you back. It made things... awkward. \nMARTIN \nWhy are you telling me all this? \nANNABELLE \n(Strained) Because… explaining things, giving answers, like this... it’s not what I \nam. It’s difficult, against my nature. \nAnd I’m trying to practice. \nMARTIN \nWhy? \nANNABELLE \nWhy do you think? \n(Martin groans) \nSorry. \nMARTIN \nOkay, let’s try a different question. What was your plan? \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 196 – This Old House \n \n19 \nANNABELLE \nI was gonna snatch you away. Lure you both into this web, and then take you. \nDrive him to despair, so that when you returned to him, bulging, and talking in \na thousand tiny voices, it would drive him to a final push. \nMARTIN \nAnd now? \nANNABELLE \n(Sighs) Your bond is too complicated. I couldn’t drive that kind of rift between \nyou now. I’ve considered every angle, examined every cause and effect, and \nhave finally come to the conclusion that I... (sighs) I need to tell you the truth, \nto explain things. \nMARTIN \n(Frustrated) Yeah, but why? \nANNABELLE \nBecause if I do… you’ll do as I ask. \nMARTIN \nOh will we? \nANNABELLE \nYes. \n(Annabelle takes a deep breath) \n[She takes a few steps]", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 4, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 4215}}
