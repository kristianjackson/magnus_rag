She said that Natalie had tried \nto ‘convert’ her. She had come to Kathy's room earlier that night, knocked on \nthe door, very polite. She'd seemed cheerier than she had since her mum's \ndeath, and asked if Kathy wanted to have some dinner and talk. Now, \nobviously, Kathy had wanted to discuss moving out for months, but she'd \nnever been in a fit state, so she jumped at the chance. \nThe dining room was dark. Natalie must have unscrewed the lightbulb again \nbecause the switch did nothing. Thin slivers of moonlight coming through the \ncurtains gave just enough light to see the table, and two bowls at either end. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG025 – Growing Dark \n6 \n \nNatalie sat at one end, and waved for Kathy to sit at the other. Kathy had \nwanted to run… but didn't know quite how to do so. She said it would have \nfelt... rude. So she sat down, and tried to eat what Natalie had prepared. She \nthought it might have been spinach, but if so it must have been boiled for far \ntoo long and all that remained was a stringy, limp mush. It was stone cold, and \nshe could barely get through two forkfuls before she started to retch; it was so \nslimy. She pushed it away as gently as she could. She said Natalie just watched, \nnot even glancing at her own bowl. \nFinally, Kathy managed to get the nerve to speak, and told her she wanted to \nmove out. There was silence for a long second, and then Natalie had said she \ndid as well. I'll admit I sighed with relief when Kathy said that, but she shook \nher head and continued. Natalie had begun to speak, longer and in more detail \nthan she had for a long time. She had said that she need to move out, that the \nshe had a new home to being going to, a new family. She said that they were \nall going, that 300 years was a long time to wait, but she was lucky to have \nfound it so close to the end. She said that it wasn't long until they were \ncollected by Mr. Pitch. She said that Kathy could come too, if she liked. She \ncould be saved. \nIt was at this point Kathy realised Natalie was talking about her ‘church’. She \nbecame… very scared, and stood up, telling Natalie thanks, but she wasn't \nreally one for Christian worship. And Natalie laughed at this. Laughed long and \nhard, never breaking eye contact. She had said, “No, but you're a natural for \nThem. You're worshipping as we speak.” It was at that point Kathy ran, and \ncame over to my house. Natalie hadn't tried to stop her. \nAt this point I was angry as all hell. If Natalie wanted to join some weird cult, \nand by that point we were both sure that's what it was, then that was her \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG025 – Growing Dark \n7 \n \nbusiness, but she was scaring Kathy. There was no way I was going to let that \nstand. I told her that I was going over to her flat and was going to have it out \nwith Natalie. I don't know what I was going to do. I mean, I wasn't going to hit \nher or anything; I just needed to make it clear that you couldn't just screw with \npeople's lives like this. Kathy told me not to go, but she wasn't in any fit state \nto stop me. I got in the car and started to drive. \nIt was an overcast night, and without the moon the streets were dark. The \nlamps on the road seemed… dull, and even my headlights didn't reach as far as \nI thought they should. It wasn't far to the small house. I didn't expect any lights \nto be on, but the silent darkness of the place still sent a shivers down my spine. \nI had a key to the door, and let myself in. I'd taken a torch from my car, and \nsure enough the lights weren't turning on. The hallway was silent, but my \nnerves were on edge and I started to look through each room in turn. Nothing. \nThere was no sign of Natalie at all. \nI stood there, in front of her room. It just had a normal, wooden fire door, but \nmy hand still hesitated as I reached to open it. I knew it was empty, by now I \nwas sure she wasn’t home. Still, I was starting to feel that fear that Kathy had \ndescribed, and I saw that my hand was shaking. I tried to ignore it, grit my \nteeth, and I opened the door. \nThe room inside was empty, as I had thought. But it wasn’t just that Natalie \nwas out; it was completely bare. No furniture, no possessions, nothing. The \ncarpet had been torn up, leaving the bare floorboards exposed and the \nwallpaper had been stripped from the wall. All of it had been stuffed and \nnailed up against the room’s only window, leaving it completel", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 3, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 4499}}
