Early to mid-19th century Victorian vaults, undisturbed for 70 years? It \nwas exactly the sort of thing that’s in vogue at the moment with a certain \nsection of arty magazines, and I was sure I could sell a few to Getty and a \nhandful of other stock photo sites. And hey, it wasn’t like I hadn’t broken into a \nchurch before. \nLuckily, St Paul’s, West Hackney was Church of England, meaning they didn’t \nlock up as tight as some places. Catholic churches can be a real pain as they \nactually have some valuables inside that need to be protected, but this, like \nmost C of E, was plain and unadorned inside. So, while they took plenty of care \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 063 – The End of the Tunnel \n \n4 \n \nwith the offices, they weren’t so conscientious about locking up the main \nchurch building, because quite frankly, there was nothing to steal, unless you \nlike hymn books. It took me and Luke less than a minute to get inside. It was \nlast Tuesday, the 25th. I suppose technically it was Wednesday, the 26th, as it \nwas well past midnight when we made our move. \nOnce we were in, we kept our torches low, stowed our equipment, and went \nlooking for anything that might get us deeper inside. At first it looked like we \nmight have been mistaken and there was no way beneath. But then Luke \nspotted what looked like a removable panel in the floor, just off to the right of \nwhat passed for a podium. It was heavier than it looked, but, after a bit of work \nwith the crowbar, it came off. It didn’t look like it had been removed in \ndecades, maybe not since the new church was built, but what surprised me \nwas the air that came out when it shifted. It hissed like a long-held breath and \nthe air that rose up from that hole was icy cold and damp. Not unexpected, but \nwhat did surprise me was how clean it smelled. Like an autumn night after the \nrain. \nThere was no ladder or stairs down, but we’d brought plenty of rope, so in we \nwent. The gloom seemed to swallow us, and I would have sworn that at times I \ncould feel it physically pressing against me. As it turned out, it was only a \ncouple metres down to the floor of the underground tunnel, and our flashlights \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 063 – The End of the Tunnel \n \n5 \n \nshowed exactly what I’d hoped for: old Victorian brickwork. The passage \nstretching away from us in both directions was absolutely perfect and I wasted \nno time in setting up a few shots, while Luke placed the lighting rigs. Down \nthere, the flashes seemed almost blinding, but I was sure I was getting some \nexcellent shots. It was only when I had a quick glance through them on the \nscreen of my SLR that I began to get irritated. Clearly, Luke had been standing \nin front of the light when I had started to shoot. In every single image, where \nthe far wall was lit by the bright lights, you could see the clear shape of a \nperson’s shadow. \nI got into quite an argument with Luke about it. He insisted that he’d never \nmake such a rookie move. I told him that he could argue with me, but not with \nthe camera. Eventually he stormed off to ‘go exploring’ further on. I took \nanother picture before I followed him. The shadow was still there, and it \nseemed to be ever so slightly closer. \nI don’t know why I ignored it. The human mind is amazingly adept at ignoring \nthings that don’t make sense, that it doesn’t want to see. I convinced myself it \nwas a quirk of the angles at that location. I didn’t even let myself entertain the \nthought that it could be a problem with my extremely expensive camera, so I \ndefinitely didn’t consider the possibility of a supernatural explanation.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 1, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 3687}}
