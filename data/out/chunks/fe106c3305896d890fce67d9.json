Without \nthe lighted window in the distance, how am I to see myself apart from it? No, \nsuch a world would be terribly dull, and scares me in a very different way. A \nfear I am happy to offer up, of course, but one that I would prefer not come to \npass. My instinct was much like the others, I thought that if I could complete \nmy ritual first, then the potential birth of the dreadful change would be \nmeaningless. \nI started it shortly before Simon convinced me to join him in his little space \nexperiment. It was interesting, of course, but in the end a tremendous waste of \nmoney just to scare a single astronaut. But, I had it in my mind that it might \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 159 – The Last \n \n14 \ndistract from my true attempt. I had commissioned the services of architects, \ndesigners and sociologists, all under a variety of pretences, and had secured a \nplot of land near Aldgate East. I was going to build a tower block of my very \nown. Oh, it was a marvel of design, deceptively spacious apartments, yet no \nroom quite big enough for a double bed or decent sized sofa, cooking facilities \nthat seemed adequate until you tried to do more than microwave, an office \nspace in every flat, but without a door so you could never truly escape your \nwork. None of them had more than a single bedroom, though each had a main \nbathroom and an ensuite, which is a small touch I was very proud of. The lower \nfour levels were left deliberately empty, so anyone living there could only see \nthe people below from a distance, the lights of the city that they were \nremoved from. The windows were thick and every wall had soundproofing \ninside it. The corridors were full of false doors, so even though each floor was \ndesigned to minimise the probability of residents encountering each other, it \nwould seem as though they were crowded in by doors that would not open if \nknocked on. I made the elevators very small. \nThen I offered the rooms at a ridiculously low price for their central London \nlocation, and then screened the applicants mercilessly. I prioritised those who \nwere newly moved to the city, graduates who needed cheap accommodation \nand were moving into intensive, high-stress jobs that would give them little \ntime for socialising. Recent divorcees were also very suitable, especially those \nwhose friends had sided with their partner. I crammed them in, pushing them \nto stew in a cocktail of distant lights, empty corridors and lukewarm takeout \nfor one. The plan was to wait until those inside reached a critical mass of \nloneliness and despair, then, all at once, lock them in remotely, cut off their \ninternet and phone lines, and leave them to die alone in their single-occupancy \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG 159 – The Last \n \n15 \nprofessional tombs as the Forsaken emerged from their terror. I called it The \nSilence, though to be honest it was mainly because I thought they had to have \nnames. Can’t say if the title was desperately inspired. \nThen, of course, Gertrude Robinson happened. Do you know how she did it? \nWhat devastating weapon she used to derail my plan? The newspaper. She \ntipped off someone in The Guardian. I still remember seeing the headline, \nthere in black and white: “The Loneliest Building in Britain”. Trouble is, \neveryone I'd picked was while middle class, so people actually cared, falling \nover themselves to declare it emblematic of the problems of the modern \nworld. Urgh. The think-pieces started to pour in, the applications started to \ndrop off, and I was up to my neck in community outreach programs. No way to \nsalvage it. Years of my life and a sizable fortune down the drain. She didn't \neven have the decency to kill me. \nIt really knocked me back. Took me years to find myself again. I returned to the \nTundra, tried to forget, but the trouble was I'd tasted the game now, and I was \nstill hungry for more. \nI suppose that's why I was so keen when Elias contacted me. We'd kept in \ntouch, of course, my family helped fund the institute, and he'd always been \ngood about tipping me off to potential victims. Going through something \nhorrific can leave you feeling very isolated indeed, especially if you know no-\none else will believe you.
