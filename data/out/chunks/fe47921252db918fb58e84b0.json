They were far too \nsharp for that. And they were definitely following us. \nWhen we met the second expedition, it seemed like I was the only one \nsurprised. There were almost a dozen of them, fitted with cold weather outfits \nand icebreaking equipment, and they seemed to take no heed of the thick, \nhumid heat of the jungle. They greeted us like old friends, and Raleigh began to \nask them what they had found, how their search was going, how many had \nmade it. I tried to say a few words, but by this point I was so disorientated, so \nout of step with whatever path the expedition was treading, that even if they \ncould hear me it was clear they had no intention of listening. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 133 – Dead Horse \n \n7 \n \nThe leader of the second expedition, a man in a thick sealskin coat, was talking \nexcitedly about their progress, about their hunt for the northwest passage, and \nI realised with a start that this man was John Franklin, the famed polar \nexplorer, whose ships the Terror and the Erebus had been trapped in the ice \nand lost in northern Canada. The crews had disappeared, and many believed \nthey had resorted to cannibalism. Of course, that seemed far less of a concern \nto me at that moment than the fact that John Franklin’s expedition had taken \nplace almost a hundred years previously. There was no way these people could \nbe real, no way they could be here. But they were solid enough, and the gleam \nand obsession in their eyes matched Raleigh’s exactly. Jack looked on in awe at \nthe both of them. \nWe were briefly fourteen people, but then the things that had been following \nus attacked in the night. I awoke to screams and gunfire, the scents of blood \nand death. Something more cunning than a jaguar tore through my tent, teeth \neager to find my throat, and it was only my paranoia of the other members of \nthis expanded expedition that had kept my revolver close enough that I \nsurvived the struggle. When it was over, and the beasts were dead or driven \noff, I heard a sound that chilled me more than the vicious screams of the \npredators. The blood-drunk cheering of the survivors: a sound of triumph, \nelation and cruelty. There were six of us left, and I reloaded my pistol before I \nreturned to my bed. \nThe world was changing with every day we marched forward, feverishly \nhunting for a destination I was no longer sure of. Raleigh hadn’t mentioned the \ncity of Z for days, and Franklin at no point indicated any destination other than \nthe northwest passage, though he walked through the heart of Brazil. And now \nthe very trees seemed to be fleeing us, branches and trunks bending away as \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 133 – Dead Horse \n \n8 \n \nwe passed, save for those that sharpened themselves and stretched towards \nus. There were things moving through the trees now that looked at first like \nmen, but they did not move like them. Their mouths never opened, but I knew \nthere was something dreadful about them. \nThere was a grotesque absurdism to it all, and I sometimes thought I might \nburst out laughing, though I knew that would quickly change to sobbing, and I \nwould be exposed. I had felt my safest option was to feign that same obsession \nthat gripped Raleigh, that had taken my son. Though they both seemed to have \na clearer idea of exactly what was going on, they didn’t question me too \nclosely as long I seemed to share it. For all my navigational and cartographic \nskill, I had not the faintest idea where we were. At times, the position of the \nsun cast doubt on even the continent through which we travelled. \nWe found Eduard von Toll a few days later. I recognised him immediately, as \nhe had always been an inspiration of mine, right up until he and his ship, the \nZarya, had vanished while hunting for the elusive polar island of Zemla \nSanikova. Now he and his crew were pinning the things that looked like men to \ntrees with long iron spikes. They thrashed and struggled, and a long, bulbous \ntongue hung from their throats, pinned by the iron of Von Toll’s men. “I cannot \nstand bloodsuckers,” Raleigh said approvingly, as he conversed quietly with \nBaron Von Toll in French. Two of the figures pinned to the trees screamed in \npain. They had no tongue, no distended belly filled with stolen blood, but no-\none seemed to notice, or if they did notice, no-one cared. In the joy of the \nhunt, they had been seized, and that was that. \nAnd so, the expedition began again, with no sign", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 3, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 4499}}
