My fingers gripped the edges of a windowpane slick with some \nsort of dark oil. It took a moment for my eyes to focus on the figures inside, \nand even then they were blurred by the slime-encrusted glass. \nI could see Gordon, sat in a thick, threadbare armchair, motionless. Bent over \nhim was the thin, hunched form of Old Maggie. Tiny shapes moved over my \nfriend’s still form, as her thin hands smoothed pieces of ancient, yellowed \npaper over his face. Her dressing gown was wet, and her wrinkled skin \nglistened with a pale fluid that dripped from her fingers as she smoothed the \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG084 – Possessive \n8 \n \nstrips in place. I could hear her singing a soft, crooning song, and as her voice \ngot louder the things crawling over Gordon got faster and more agitated. \nThen my foot slipped, and a glass bottle fell from its pile. It wasn’t loud. It \ndidn’t even break. But that was all the excuse I needed to run. I don’t know if \nshe heard it, the mere idea that she might see me was enough to send me \nsprinting all the way back home to safety. When my mum saw the state of my \nclothes, she sent me to bed without dinner, which was fine by me. I crawled \nunder the covers and lay there until sleep finally came. \nGordon was fine. He was in school the next day like nothing had happened, \nand we never spoke about it. He stopped delivering to Old Maggie, though. At \nleast, I think he did. I lost touch with him about a year later, when my family \nmoved again, this time to Liverpool. And I tried to convince myself that it had \nall been a dream. \nI’d almost managed it, as well, until I found myself in Ipswich last month on \nbusiness. My drive home took me near to Cratfield, so I decided to pass \nthrough for old time’s sake. I stopped at the White Hart for a coffee, and \nended up chatting with some locals. \nWe talked about nothing for an hour or so, until someone mentioned offhand \nabout having to swing by the dump with their old mattress. I asked him when \nCratfield had gotten a dump, and he explained it was actually just a patch of \nold waste ground where folk tossed their rubbish. \nDid it have a name, I asked, and he nodded, casually, like he had no idea that \nwhat he was saying mattered in the least. Sure, he told me, it was named for \nthe weird recluse who owned the place. They called it “Gordie’s Dump”. \nStatement ends. \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG084 – Possessive \n9 \n \nMARTIN \nWell, I, er… I think that was okay. Er, yeah. To anyone listening, sorry about the \nchange of tone. \nJohn, the, uh, Head Archivist is… absent, so I’ll be trying to fill in as best as I \ncan. Um. Maybe Tim as well, if he… if he feels like it. It, It doesn’t matter, I \nsuppose. Just as long as it gets done. \nErm, I fol– We followed up on the address provided by Adrian Weiss, and… it… \nis a pretty unpleasant piece of land, owned by Gordon Goodman. Records \nshow he was bequeathed it by the last owner, Miss Margaret Carnegie, upon \nher death in 1982. Er, in fact he was her sole beneficiary, it looks like. \nMiss Carnegie’s death was listed as ‘natural causes’, most likely pneumonia, \nbut it was apparently hard to be sure given the state of her body. Her lungs \nseemed to be full of newspaper pulp, and her back and sides covered in… you \nsee, well, the report lists them as “cancerous growths”, but the description… I \nmean, I mean, they sound more like insect legs. It also describes them as \nhaving “significant post-mortem autonomous motor function”, which I’m \nguessing means they were somehow still moving. \nGordon Goodman is on record as the one who identified her body, and the \ncorpse went missing the following night. Which leads me to wonder if maybe \nhe didn’t want to let her go, either. I mean… maybe he, um… \nOh, er, h-hold on. \n(Away from the microphone) Er, excuse me? Excuse me! \n[The door opens.] \nMELANIE \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG084 – Possessive \n10 \n \nOh, yes, hello? \nMARTIN \nThis is… The Archives aren’t actually open to the public. \nMELANIE \nEr, I know. There, there wasn’t anyone on the door, though. I’m… I’m looking \nfor the Archivist? \nMARTIN \nAh. You’re Miss, er… Richardson? \nMELANIE \nKing. \nMARTIN \nKing! Yes. Right. \nMELANIE \nMelanie is fine. Is he here? \nMARTIN \nAre, are… Oh, are you alright? \nMELANIE \nOh, um, no. Not really. Got shot. Sort of. In India. \nMARTIN \nWhat?", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 3, "chunk_count": 6, "chars": 4449}}
