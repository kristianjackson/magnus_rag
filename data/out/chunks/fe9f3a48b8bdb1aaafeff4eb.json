I have \ntouched something now, though, that all my talk of ley lines and mother \ngoddesses could never have prepared me for. It is not a god. Or if it is then it is \na dead god, decayed and clammy corpse-flesh brimming with writhing \ngraveworms. \nWhen did I first hear it? It wasn’t the nest, I’m sure of that. I never went in the \nattic. It was locked and I didn’t have a key. I spent a day sawing through the \npadlock with an old hacksaw. My hands were blistered by the end. Why would \nI have done that if I didn’t know what I would find? The face of the one who \nsang to me dwelling within the hidden darkness above me. I had seen no \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG032 – hive \n5 \n \nwasps. I know I hadn’t. There are no wasps in the nest. So how else would I \nhave known that I needed to be there, to be in the dark with it, if it had not \nalready been singing to me? \nNo, that’s not right. The nest does not sing to me. It is simply the face. Not the \nwhole face, for the whole of the hive is infinite. An unending plane of wriggling \nforms swarming in and out of the distended pores and honeycombed flesh. \nThe nest is nothing but paper. \nWas it the spiders? There were webs in the corners, around the entryway into \nthe attic. I would watch them scurry and disappear in between the wooden \nboards. ‘Where are you going, little spiders?’ I would think. ‘What are you \nseeing in the dark? Is it food? Prey? Predators?’ I wondered if it was the \nspiders that made the gentle buzzing song. It was not. Webs have a song as \nwell, of course, but it is not the song of the hive. \nI used to pick at my skin. It was a compulsion. I would spend hours in the \nbathroom, staring as close as I could get to my face to the mirrors, searching \nfor darkened pores to squeeze and watch the congealed oil worm its way out \nof my skin. Often I would end with swollen red marks where it had become \ninflamed with irritation or infection. Did I hear the song then? \nWas it when I was a child, such a clear memory of a classmate telling me a \nblackhead was a hole in my face, and if I didn’t keep it clean it would grow and \nrot. Did I hear it then, as that image lodged in my mind forever? Or was it last \nyear, passing by a strip of green they call a park near my house, after the rain, \nand watching a hundred worms crawl and squirm to the surface. \nPerhaps I’ve always heard it. Perhaps the itch has always been the real me, and \nit was the happy, smiling Jane who called herself a witch and drank wine in the \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG032 – hive \n6 \n \npark when it was sunny. Maybe it was her who was the maddened illusion the \nhides the sick squirming reality of what I am. Of what we all are, when you \nstrip away the pretence that are there is more to a person than a warm, wet \nhabitat for the billion crawling things that need a home. That love us in their \nway. \nI need to think. To clear my head. To try and remember, but remember what? I \nwas lonely before. I know that. I had friends, at least I used to, but I lost them. \nOr they lost me. Why was it? I remember shouting, recriminations, and I was \nabandoned. No idea why. The memories are a blur. I do remember that they \ncalled me “toxic”. I don’t think I really knew what that meant, except that it \nwas the reason I was so very painfully lonely. Was that it? Was I swayed and \ndrawn simply by the prospect of being genuinely loved? Not loved as you \nwould understand it. A deeper, more primal love. A need as much as a feeling. \nLove that consumes you in all ways. \nYou can’t help me. I’m sure of that now. I have tried to write it down, to put it \ninto terms and words you could understand. And now I stare at it and not a \nword of it is even enough to fully describe the fact that I itch. Because ‘itch’ is \nnot the right word. There is no right word because for all your Institute and \nignorance may laud the power of the word, it cannot even stretch to fully \ncapture what I feel in my bones. What possible recourse could there be for me \nin your books and files and libraries except more useless ink and dying letters? \nI see now why the hive hates you. You can see it and log it and note it’s every \ndetail but you can never understand it. You rob it of its fear even though your \nweak words have no right to do so.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 2, "chunk_count": 5, "chars": 4333}}
