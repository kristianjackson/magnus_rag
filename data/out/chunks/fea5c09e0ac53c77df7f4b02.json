It’s strange after all that; I don't actually \nremember how I felt. Heavy, I think. But I had other concerns. It was a daft \nplan. It shouldn’t have worked. Someone should have driven past while I was \nmoving them. Someone should’ve seen me. But they didn’t. \nWith his keys, I let myself into Dr Pritchard’s flat and gathered as much \ninformation on the expedition as I could. It wasn’t a lot, not that I could really \nunderstand, and I just had to hope it was enough to pass myself off. Even if it \nwas only long enough to get one good night's sleep. \nAs it turned out, I needn’t have bothered. Far as I could tell, nobody on board \nhad actually met Dr Pritchard in person. A couple of people told me they had \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 121 – Far Away \n \n8 \n \nthe greatest respect for my work, and a few did say how different I had \nsounded on the phone, but once I walked up and said who I was, nobody even \nbothered to check my ID. \nI don’t remember the name of the ship. I mean, boarding it was such a blur I \ndidn’t really notice much, and later on, I was far too nervous to ask. It was \nlarge, though, with every spare inch covered in scientific equipment of some \nsort of another. I was relieved to find out I was the only chemist on board, so \nnobody was going to see me misusing anything and figure out what was going \non. At least, not until it was too late to act upon it. There were a couple of \nmarine biologists on board, a meteorologist, an engineer and someone who \ncalled herself a “macro-ecologist”, though at times she looked almost as out of \nher depth as I did. \nBeyond that, there were half a dozen crew running the ship. They were led by \nCaptain Macaby, a tall, ugly woman with a sharp tongue, though it was never \nclear to me whether she was the one in charge of the expedition, or if it was \nClara, the senior most marine biologist. It didn’t really matter, of course. As far \nas I was concerned, Dr Pritchard was a private, standoffish person, who liked to \nspend his time alone in his makeshift lab, or asleep in his bunk. \nAnd I did sleep. The further we got from land, the deeper and more peaceful it \nbecame. I still dreamed, of course, but I would just wander the empty deck of \nthe ship, drinking in the quiet atmosphere of the place. I did have to force \nmyself not to look over the railing in my dreams. Once or twice, while staring \nat the peaceful dream water, I almost felt like I could see something moving \ndeep, deep below the surface, impossibly huge and dark. I quickly learned the \nlesson to remain fully focused upon the ship when I dreamed.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 4, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 2706}}
