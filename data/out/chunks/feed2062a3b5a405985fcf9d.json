I never did, though, not even \nwhen one of them started following me. \nI first saw him in the street. It wasn’t difficult to guess what he was, half the \npeople around him were just as hollow and soulless, but there was something \nelse to him. He was tall, but not so tall as to stick out; thin, but not unhealthily \nso. He wore a blue T-shirt, despite the falling temperature, and his short, dark \nhair and pale skin surrounded a smile so fake it practically glowed. He stared at \nme as I walked past, not making a move to follow or stop me, nor did his eyes \nseem to actually move. It was like one of those paintings that watch you. It just \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 122 – Zombie \n \n15 \n \nseemed that whatever place I looked at him from, he just happened to be \nfocused on me, in as much as there was any focus in them at all. Vacant. \nThe next day he was there again, this time in the hallway outside my office, \nstanding in the centre so that I had to hug the wall to avoid touching his \nmotionless form. He was identical, except that his T-shirt was now a dull \norange. I asked my colleague Norma what she thought of him, why he was \nthere and if she noticed anything strange about him. She looked out into the \ncorridor, then looked back at me and shook her head. She told me he ‘seemed \nnormal enough’, but her eyes were like blank pits, and I knew she was lying \nabout all of it. Had he done this? Had he taken Norma’s self, her, her soul? Or \nhad she always been a zombie, cramped into her little open plan desk, \npatiently listening to client complaints, and I just hadn’t noticed? I looked \naround my office, a low dread starting to build, as he waited outside, a \nnumbing cavity wrapped in skin. \nI tried to talk to him when he stood next to me on the bus. I played it as casual \nas I could, trying not to seem afraid as I asked him how his day was going. “Just \nfine, thank you for asking,” came the flat, uninterested response. Then I-I \nasked him his name. “Just fine, thank you for asking,” he said. I have never \nwanted anything as much as I wanted in that moment to cut him and see if he \npretended to scream in pain. \nBy the time he appeared outside my house, this time wearing a rotten green T-\nshirt, I could feel a numbness in myself even as I looked at him. Was I finally \nbecoming like them, my internal world melting away into nothing but a \npantomime? I remember I ran at him, all my rage burning inside my chest as \nthough desperate to remind myself that I could still feel something. I think I \n\nThe Magnus Archives – 122 – Zombie \n \n16 \n \nmight have been screaming, but the memory is fuzzy. I remember I punched \nhim in the face, though. \nWhen my fist connected, it was like punching a canvas: taut, dry and yielding \never so slightly, until all at once it broke with a tearing pop and all that \nresistance was gone, my fist falling into the empty space behind it. Inside his \nhead. \nI-I pulled my hand back in sudden disgust, and he looked at me through the \ntorn and bloodless hole in his head. I could see one blank eye hanging down off \nhis face, still following me, as his split mouth moved to try and form the words \nthat I could hear clear as day: “Just fine, thank you for asking.” \nThey’re all like that now. You’re all like that, I suppose. I have no reason to \nbelieve anyone will read this who would be any different, no reason to believe \nyou’ll be able to read this, that you won’t simply stare blankly at this page \nbefore performing your response, your artificial opinion. There is every chance \nthat I am the only one left, and the whole world has fallen to a soulless horde, \ndevoid of life and feeling. Even so, thank you for pretending to care. \nARCHIVIST \nStatement ends. \n(The Archivist exhales; his voice is sounding stronger) Well, that certainly \nhelped, I think. No notes or follow-up in the statement and obviously no \nresearch done into it by myself or, uh... my team. I think we can safely say that \nMs. St John is not the only real person left in the world, though, whatever she \nmight be doing now.
