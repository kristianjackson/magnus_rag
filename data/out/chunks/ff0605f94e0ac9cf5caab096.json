Some of them were \nmore than a little bit unsettling, but only one managed to send me spiralling \ninto the place I am now. \nAs I said, it was one of the last boxes I opened on the second day. It was late \nand I had already made my way through most of a bottle of wine. The more I \nthink about it, the more I think that opening that box felt no different to any of \nthe others. No odd feelings, no smells, nothing. It was just a box, empty of \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 060 – Observer Effect \n \n6 \n \neverything except a single typewritten note and an old hand mirror. It lay \ninside, utterly innocuous. If it was a trap, there was no way to tell. I picked up \nthe note first. The typing was neat, managed to be completely centred, even \nthough the paper seemed to be a scrap that had been torn from a larger piece. \nIt read, in all capitals, \"BEHIND YOU\". \nI'm sure you don't need me to tell you how unsettling that was. I turned and \nlooked almost before I fully understood what I had read. There was a window \nbehind me, with a view of the street below my brother's study and the \ndarkening sky above it. There was nothing there though. Nobody walking along \nthe street, no cars driving down it, nothing that seemed in any way out of \nplace. I looked back at the note, shrugged and reached down for the mirror. It \nwas a bit heavier than I had expected and under a thick layer of tarnish. The \nframe seemed to be gold, or at least gold plated. The glass itself was a bit \ngrimy, but still seemed to be intact. I have no idea how old it was or what \nperiod it might have been made and, though I searched the box thoroughly, I \ncouldn't find anything that might explain where Christopher got it. \nI looked in the mirror. I was a mess: hair unwashed, eyes red from crying, lips \npatchily stained a bruised purple from the wine. I hadn't really had any time to \ntake care of or even look at myself since I got to Christopher's house and this \nancient hand mirror really showed it. I sighed, shook my head, and prepared to \n\nThe Magnus Archives – Episode 060 – Observer Effect \n \n7 \n \ncheck the next box, when the angle on the mirror shifted in my hand slightly \nand I screamed. It now reflected the window behind me, and I could see a face \nstaring in. \nIt was dark outside, and it was almost entirely in shadow, so I couldn't tell you \nmuch about the features, but it was huge, seeming to take up most of the \nwindow behind me. The only thing about it that I could see with any real clarity \nwere the eyes. Bright, shining, bulging eyes, with pupils so dark it made me feel \nsick, drinking everything in, watching with a greedy intensity. I could feel its \ngaze burning into the back of my neck, feel its unblinking eyes. My muscles \nlocked in sudden terror and the mirror tumbled out of my hand, spinning only \nonce before it hit the floor and shattered into a thousand tiny shards. \nSeven years bad luck, isn't it? Maybe that's it. Maybe I have to feel this horrid \naching panic of the eyes I know are following me for seven years before they \nfinally leave. I hope not, but maybe even that's wishful thinking. Maybe this is \nnow my life forever and it will never, ever stop. I've tried to think whether I'd \nbe able to go on if that was the case. I think I'd try, at least until my parents \npassed away. I couldn't stand for them to lose both children. \nObviously, that was when my real problems began.
