A ‘meat processing plant’. I won't say \nwhich one. I don't want to get in any trouble. It was up near Dalston, though, \nso you can probably figure it out. Not so many around out there as to make it \n\nThe Magnus Archives – MAG030 – Killing Floor \n2 \n \nhard. Not so many around anywhere. It's not something most folks want \nnearby. It smells awful if you're not used to it and people tell me they get a \nweird vibe. I never did, at least not before all this happened. Maybe that says \nsomething about me, though. \nThere's not so much difference between people and animals, you know? Not \nsaying that I'd be keen to kill a person, or that humans are all stupid. No, I'm \nsaying that animals are smarter than you give them credit for. They look dumb, \nsure, but I know what I'm talking about when I say that every damn animal in \nthat place knew exactly why they were there. You don't need to be smart to \nknow when you're surrounded by your own mutilation. \nWhen I first started I did a lot of the driving, and right from loading them up, \nyou can hear it in their whining. They know what’s going on, they know where \nthey’re going. I’ve heard a lot of engineering oand science types talk about \n“stressors”, “novelty” or “cortisol levels” when discussing how best to avoid \n“triggering fear or flight responses”. If it lets them keep enjoying their steak, \nthey can use whatever words they want to, but every wide-eyed cow I’ve ever \nput into a squeeze chute knows exactly where that ride ends. \nYou hear grisly tales about the torment of animals in the slaughterhouse, and \nthe things done to them by the cold, relentless machinery, but so often the \ncasual human brutality is overlooked. A worker and an abattoir are rated on \nmany things, and one of them is how cruel or distressing they are for the \nlivestock passing through. If you’re abusive to your animals, you won’t get as \nhigh a rating, but that’s about it. You’re not going to lose your job unless you \nreally overstep the line, and sometime you have a bad day. The sort of day that \nit feels good to work out on a bit of pig flesh, as it goes towards its end. I mean, \nI wouldn’t really have said that sort of cruelty was common beyond the", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 0, "chunk_count": 7, "chars": 3048}}
