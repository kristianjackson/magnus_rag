And my wrist ached \nwhere five deep red marks made the shape of a clutching hand. \n\nThat’s it. \nARCHIVIST \nWell, that certainly sounds like an... unpleasant experience. I’m not sure I \nunderstand, though. Did you fall asleep, somehow, or... \nKAROLINA \nI must have done. \nARCHIVIST \nThat’s... that’s impressive. Do you still take the Tube? \nKAROLINA \nOf course. I live in London. \nARCHIVIST \nRight. I, uh... \nKAROLINA \nIs there anything else? I’ve told you what happened, so I’m done here, correct? \nARCHIVIST \nI suppose so, yes. We’ll look into it, and if we find anything we’ll let you know. \nKAROLINA \nDon't bother. I'm done with it. Thank you for your time. \n \n \n[Tape clicks off] \nARCHIVIST \n\nWell, that was brusque. Ms. Górka may not be interested in the follow up, but I \nam. Since the Night Tube opened there have been a handful of disappearances \nthat occurred where the individuals in question were reported as intending to \ntravel on the late-night London Underground service, mostly on the Victoria \nand Northern lines. All of them were travelling alone. The reason none of this \nhas been followed up as related is that CCTV from the appropriate stations \ndoes not show the disappeared ever actually arriving. Well, Sasha managed to \nfollow this up and it would seem that there’s no record of Ms. Górka ever \nentering King’s Cross St Pancras, even though Martin made contact with \nLeanne Hilliard and confirmed the rest of her story. TFL have been \nunderstandably reluctant to comment. \nInterestingly, one of the missing, a man named Nicholas Lekman, has a picture \nthat seems to match the description Ms. Górka gave: age 63, slightly unkempt \ngrey beard, blue eyes. He was last seen heading towards Moorgate station at \n2:30 on the morning of Saturday the 17th December 2017, following a fight \nwith his son, who does not believe he ever entered the station. Apparently \nNicholas Lekman hated taking the Underground alone as he was a severe \nclaustrophobe. I should probably mention this to Sasha. I believe she takes the \nVictoria line to work and has a tendency to stay later than she should. \nAside from that, all that’s left to do is sweep up after Ms. Górka. She left the \nplace rather dusty. \nEnd recording. \n[Tape clicks off. Tape clicks on.] \nSupplemental. \n\nSomeone is living down there. In the tunnels. I’m sure of it now. I haven’t \nfound any more pages or detritus that might indicate that the presence of \nfurther books, but the more I explore the lower levels, the more normal \nrubbish I find. Food wrappers, empty bottles, even a newspaper dated last \nyear. They are normally quite meticulous, it seems, as those things I have \nfound tended to be tucked away in places that might have escaped the notice \nof someone cleaning up after themselves. But they do miss things. \nI find it oddly comforting that who- or whatever is down there needs to eat, as \nit offers some reassurance that they are at least broadly human. But why? And \nfor how long? And how are they getting their supplies? If Basira was taking my \ncalls I would ask for some police assistance, in case it’s some unhinged \nmurderer. Especially as there is every likelihood they were the one that killed \nGertrude. \nAssuming it is only one. Yes, on second thoughts, I might well suspend my \nexplorations until I can talk to Basira and get some assistance. \nEnd supplemental. \n[The Magnus Archives Theme - Outro] \nThe Magnus Archives is a podcast distributed by Rusty Quill and licensed under \na creative commons attribution, non-commercial share alike 4.0 international \nlicense.
